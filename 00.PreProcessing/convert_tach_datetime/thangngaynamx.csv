When employees stock they blast there music on there phones or on there phones, went on 1/12/19 the store was a mess there was open products on selves and stuff everywhere. Then you had employee having a meeting in the middle of the aisles. This is the Beaumont ca. Store"
1,43723,Frank GÃ³mez,13/01/2021,Walmart,Horrible place staff are rude and would not return my product
2,43724,Kyle Brady,13/01/2021,Walmart,Ordered 18 frames got my delivery today opened the box and to my Horror 3/4 were smashed to hell there was 3 packing bubbles on top and nothing else to protect the frames. Once I pulled them all out the 5 on bottom were face down with no packing protection on bottom they were completely smashed. There was so many glass shards everywhere I cut myself and my son later in the day got some stuck in his foot because it was a micro splinter size.. TRAINED PACKING PROFESIONALS IT CLEARLY STATES ON THE SITE.. This is beyond unacceptable. Laziest dangerous packing.
3,43725,Beth Elliott,13/01/2021,Walmart,"Walmart you just lost about 75 million customers and you can thank your own Twitter account for this. You lost a long time shopper, I will be giving my Business to HEB now. I know of many more people who are no longer supporting Walmart."
4,43726,Marion Anderson,13/01/2021,Walmart,"Walmart is enjoying a huge increase in online pricing on items such as meats. Don't bother trying to get the lesser priced ticket sale when your meat arrives. Their customer service will not so nicely tell you that if you want the lower price, go do your own shopping. They charged me 15.26 online and the ticketed price when it arrived was actually 10.77 (this was just one package of the two packages I had ordered) and they refused to honor the lower price stating it was the stores responsibility to remove the price tag. The store claims they have nothing at all to do with on line pricing and cannot help you. Their profits are booming during covid while smaller stores suffer."
5,47319,Paul,14/01/2015,Walmart,"The site is okay, I just can't take the stores. Rude staff that could care less about the customers, they don't answer the phones in any departments, it's messy, they close lanes to make the lines long. I don't shop at Walmart anymore as a result and warn others of the constant bad experience when going there. Try calling and asking for a department, see if anyone answers. Then you call back to ask for a manager but since they have caller id they just ignore you or send you back to the same department that won't answer. In the end you just post a bad review and find others stores to shop at. Walmart really sucks!"
6,46884,Leah,14/01/2019,Walmart,"I ordered a diamond earring & pendant set from walmart.com on 11/30 hoping it would arrive before Christmas. On Dec 23rd, there was no update as to whether it was coming at all. So I canceled that order and as of 1/14/19 I have YET to get a refund! I have called over 5 times and keep getting put on hold with no resolution. Meanwhile my credit card is accruing interest. I should NOT have had to pay for an item that never shipped!"
7,43717,CHAD RIEWSKI,14/01/2021,Walmart,"Just horrible customer service at the Branson hills parkway location, act like it's such a big deal to just match a walmart.com order, that they have in store, so now I had to wait over 2 hours to get, just horrible!!!!!"
8,43718,Tim W.,14/01/2021,Walmart,Ordered full size bunk beds. Then waited a month to get them delivered. The delivery company arrived today with a sectional futon. We refused delivery and now have to wait two more weeks so they say to send us the right item. We will see if and when we get it and hopefully it is the right item this time.
9,43719,Marlin Cromwell,14/01/2021,Walmart,"The Walmart store located in Hendersonville, NC (28792) is a complete disaster!!! The appearance is terrible and appears to look like a warehouse. It appears no management at all in this location. Employees do not appear happy. This location needs serious work and attention."
10,43720,whidbey island Frank,14/01/2021,Walmart,"Bought an electrical part from Walmart it lasted a couple days and then burnt out went to return it and they tried keeping my shipping money, actually still fighting with the money now might just have to call my credit card and let them take care of it, go wall hole, I remember why I don't use Walmart anymore...."
11,43721,taurus dotson,14/01/2021,Walmart,I ordered a Whalen Payton 3-in-1 Flat Panel TV Stand with glass tops. I got the box and one of the glass tops was cracked on the end. The box was extremely heavy and awkward to move but finally get in end. I continued to have it put together as I thought I would call and send pics of what happen. I asked for a percentage off of $119 for my trouble. The agent said I can send the whole thing back or get a percentage of which would be $5. I explained to her I would not send that large item back but thought $5 was a little low I was thinking at least $20. Anything fragile I will probably never order again. Too much trouble. Luckily the gift was still a hit. Come on Walmart!
12,43722,Lori Nicely,14/01/2021,Walmart,"Watch your bank accounts cause where I bank they hold your money for 3 days and then its paid for BUT they recharge u for the products that u all ready brought. When you go to call them it's your banks fault and not Walmart's but it is Walmart, rescanning the product again. Bout ready to go to news media now."
13,41756,Rauchelle Larmond,14/01/2022,Walmart,"Yesterday at 1pm I attempted to order groceries online from walmart my time slot was between 4-5 pm I was using a gift card to pay for the order the page website froze during the order confirmation after waiting 15 minutes for it to load pI open a new tab typed in walmart and my items were still in my cart ... I clicked place order and it was asking for me to pay again I typed in the gift card number and realized the balance shown meant the card had already been charged I got on the line with customer service explaining the issue hoping they would put the order through or refund the money of the gift card the customer rep told me there was nothing they could do that a refund to the card will take 5 business days and that I would need to reorder. So the rep reordered the groceries for me on his end using the remainder of the money on my gift card and the remaining sum paid for with my mastercard my time slot by now was between 7-8pm the items on my list were for dinner that night so an alternate dinner needed to be prepared. Not only did I have to pay for the same grocery order twice in one day but the groceries never showed up! I called customer service at 9 30pm to inquire about my order and again they said there was nothing they could do I asked to speak to a supervisor whom told me that I would have to wait for the groceries to be delivered by the end of the day and if they're not delivered I would have to call back in the morning so the order could be made first thing in the a.m and at that point there would be some compensation for the inconvenience. I am a single mom of three children now I had no money left on my gift card and still had no groceries, well they did not show up last night and I called this morning and the customer service rep explained that they do not deliver the next day and I would have to reorder my groceries! I asked to speak to a supervisor and he called walmart to ask them to deliver my order number then I asked if there was anything they can do for this inconvenience and he said they would send me a 15 dollar eVoucher ... a multimillion dollar company just made me spend money on the same grocery order twice in one day neglected to deliver the order after all the inconvenience they caused and they offer me a measley $15? walmart is a f@!king joke and their customer service reps are rude and the supervisor was robotic he literally said thank you for calling walmart have a good day instead of sorry for the inconvenience! Then he gave me the number of the walmart for me to call afterward so that I can find out the time slot for my order since the rep at the walmart that answered the supervisors call hung up without giving a time slot. Walmart has one of the worst reputations for customer service and it is well deserved!"
14,46883,Jessica,15/01/2019,Walmart,"I purchased a holiday DVD collection and when I went to watch one of the discs in the collection, I noticed it had a cloudy white mark on the disc. The disc was not readable due to this mark. When I went to the store to return it I was told they canâ€™t take it back if itâ€™s open but they can do an exchange for the same movie. The unfortunate thing was it was after the holidays and they did not have any in stock to exchange. The girl then told me that there was nothing she could do for me. This is extremely unacceptable because I purchased this DVD defective from the store and only wouldâ€™ve known it was defective by opening it. The least they couldâ€™ve done for me was let me return it for a gift card with the amount I had paid. I will never purchase another DVD from Walmart again due to the lack of customer concern and care. I guess $20 means more to them than having a loyal customer(s)."
15,43710,Ronald Hussey,15/01/2021,Walmart,I would like to give Kenvin C a five Star rate. He is from Walnew Recliner. He was very helpful on finding my replacement part.
16,43711,Mary Thacker,15/01/2021,Walmart,"Beware! I found an unauthorized and fraudulent charge on my credit card from WalMart in East Gadsden, AL. Tried to contact store but called 2 days, sev times each day. No one would answer at customer service or at pickup and delivery. The only department that had my credit card info was pickup and delivery. But if you cannot get anyone to answer what do you do? I am elderly with pre-existing conditions. There are always people in store without masks on which is why I used pickup and delivery. NEVER AGAIN."
17,43712,Sara,15/01/2021,Walmart,Nightmare delivery they charged my credit card instead of my ebt card even though I had to put my PIN number in so I know I didnâ€™t just forget. Than to fix the issue I was told I need to physically return all of my items to the store so they can rescan the same items and charge the correct card. After I just paid and tipped for delivery
18,43713,C Caldwell,15/01/2021,Walmart,"Walmart on Tuesday said it would â€œindefinitelyâ€ suspend contributions to members of Congress who voted against certifying the results of the presidential election, as businesses come under pressure to respond after a mob stormed the Capitol last week. After being a customer of Walmart for 20 years I am saying good bye."
19,43714,David,15/01/2021,Walmart,"Joined Walmart+ to give it a try. Ordered a Blood Pressure Monitor and had it delivered from the store. Unit failed after a week. Tried to get a refund and I must do it in store????? Crazy, I ordered to have it delivered due to covid but they want me to go into the store to return?? Unbelievably stupid lapse of understanding on Walmarts part! I will stick to Amazon and there super easy and safe return policy plus more variety. Need to step it up Walmart and think of the customer service."
20,43715,Anna Martinez,15/01/2021,Walmart,"The walmart in howell would not let me pick up my package I order to their store, because apparently they pickups close at 8, which I was never told anything about, but what difference does it make if the store is open till 11pm. I paid and I want my package."
21,43716,JDJX,15/01/2021,Walmart,"I placed a small order with walmart to be delivered to my home . I paid with pay pal which they offered as a payment option. My bank account was immediately charged. I never received any kind of order confirmation etc from walmart. The order did no even show up in my walmart account page Long story short. through walmart so- called support chat I was informed that walmart didi not even have the item offered for sale and i was told that it was referred to a third party vendor. Three days passed and I still got no order info or e-mail from walmart. Four days later, I finally got an e-mail with order info.... not from walmart but from Amazon I did not order from Amazon Walmart is engaged in very dishonest and business practices and i got nothing but lies and generic answers from walmart via chat and by phone so beware of walmart"
22,41755,Lance Lehman,15/01/2022,Walmart,"Again, no shopping carts available when you walk into the store. Second time in a row this has happened. Upon check out your pretty much forced to use the self check out stations. The problem I had there was that something gross was spilled on the station. Noone even cleaned it off, just walked around like they were daydreaming. I would rate my experience as the following: it sucked."
23,47126,Pursia,16/01/2018,Walmart,"Since Walmart didn't like my review and rejected it stating it was inappropriate. Not sure how that's the case. I was very professional. Guess they just don't like hearing the truth. So now I'm going out of my way to make my review known anywhere I can. Very shady of them to do that. Can't say I'm surprised though. Here we go.  I bought a toaster from walmart online only because every walmart within distance was sold out of the item I wanted. The toaster was great. Great little Toaster. Great price. Loved it so much I got my mom one. My issue is not with the toaster but Walmart. Do not shop online!!!. They are terrible. The problem I had was with walmart and shipping. They took an extremely long time to ship. So long that my payment must have ""timed out"" because they had to charge me again before it shipped. I was unhappy with the service and the fact that walmart charged me twice. It created a hold of the amount right before xmas and charged it again. Which means they had two holds on my account. That's not right especially right before xmas. I had to wait 7-10 business days for the old amount to be released before I even received any product! What gives walmart the right to charge my card at their will? I have never had a company do that before let alone a big company like walmart. Get it together!"
24,47127,ROMINA BROWN,16/01/2018,Walmart,"EXCELLENT STUFF, I ORDRED FOOD THROUGH MY BOY AND I GOT IT BACK WITH GOOD STUFF"
25,46882,Jeanette Smith-Rowe,16/01/2019,Walmart,"I purchased item online from third party seller. They don't disclose that they will charge you shipping fees and restocking. They agreed to waive those fees, since it is not disclosed. I handed item (brand new) to Walmart agent. When I received my refund the seller charged me $12, stating item was damaged and unable to resell. If the item was damaged, the agent would have noted it or told me it was damaged and unable to return. What happened between sending it from Walmart to seller should not be my responsibility."
26,43704,Deborah Reckart,16/01/2021,Walmart,"Walmart delivery service the not reliable. Amazon delivers in 2 hrs but was willing to try Walmart, Scheduled deliver seven days ahead for a Friday delivery. Order never showed up - no call, text or email. When called Saturday evening representative said they didn't have a driver. Canceled order, Who wants order that has been sitting 24hrs for a driver? Hold for money at the bank for 24-48 hrs."
27,43705,Mika,16/01/2021,Walmart,"Beware of the delivery service. My first express delivery order has been a disaster. It was supposed to arrive in 2 hours and I havenâ€™t received it yet. Customer service is no help, Iâ€™ve only been able to speak people out of the country, which seems to be an outsourced company. They have had a difficult time themselves reaching anyone at Walmart. All they can do is escalate the issue and I have had no direct communication from Walmart at all. This was my first order and will definitely be the last. Iâ€™m cancelling the Walmart+ subscription and will take my chances with a more reputable delivery service in the future."
28,43706,Suki Rohan,16/01/2021,Walmart,"First of all, my order was scheduled to be delivered on 1/15/21 the was a delay, but no communication! Next, when I called the customer service at the store, the guy sounded like he didn't care. He rescheduled and now the driver called me from his phone that showed Alabama on the caller ID. And he could not find my apt and showed his irritation to me. This is a really bad service. I think communication can be looked at again and a bit more professionalism."
29,43707,Heidi W.,16/01/2021,Walmart,"I've been having a terrible time dealing with Walmart.com. I attempted an online grocery order, only to have every single item come up as out of stock when I attempted to pay. (Mind you, a trip to the brick-and-mortar store the next day showed this to be false.) I had an online order/pickup at store order accepted, only to be canceled several hours later. The last incident involved electronics, which were shipped in an ENVELOPE, and arrived crushed. Too unreliable, too frustrating to deal with online."
30,43708,Keila Aguiar,16/01/2021,Walmart,"I like shopping in walmart.com but it bothers me that they don't always have the right info on products, one of the things are prices or they let you get it and you add it for pick up and when the day come they tell you they don't have it and cancel the order."
31,43709,Laci,16/01/2021,Walmart,The things I've order have come on time. Only had one problem with a cancelation. But customer service fixed it immediately. In store they are super rude but online has been good.
32,41754,Gavyn S,16/01/2022,Walmart,Horrible Grocery experiences left and right. They seem to never have our items in stock. Ordering Online has become a hair pulling fiasco because they cant seem to get their sheet together! bad company all around we just need to get rid of them. stop shopping at walmart
33,47231,Wynn,17/01/2017,Walmart,"DO NOT order from Walmart online. After the first order arriving damaged and the replacement never arriving, the customer service was amongst the WORSE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED and now at their convenience I have to wait for my 1k refund and for them to pick up the damaged item. The irresponsible handling of this order actually ended up costing me money and time and the inconvenience that was completely disregarded by their customer service is absolutely disgusting. I will be sure to spread this experience as much as possible and I suggest others do the same as I am positive I am not the only person that has had dealt with and been treated like this."
34,43700,Amber Smith,17/01/2021,Walmart,I ordered 2 cell phones on Walmart.com. After taking through money out of my account the order was cancelled due to being out of stock. When I tried to find out why the money wasn't put back in my account I had 2 csr hang up on me. Finally I was able to do an online chat where the representative was still unable to help me. Worst service I have ever received. Very disappointed and hope that others will not waste their time or money with this company.
35,43701,Lynn,17/01/2021,Walmart,"I used to shop at Walmart religiously but in the past year I have slowed down and today will be the last time I will put my hard earned money towards a Company that is so incredibly gross, I was trying to return an item which I assumed they would come up with an excuse as to why they could not return, (this has been the past theme for myself and all surrounding individuals) just as I suspected they told me I had to go through the company that produced the product. Now letâ€™s move on to the more serious issue, as I waited my 25 minutes until my turn I was forced to watch and hear some of the most disgusting language and general wording towards an elderly gentleman that was trying to pick up an order that was late on Walmartâ€™s behalf, until he finally asked if he could get a refund and he would shop the items himself, the refund was granted and then as he asked if the funds was going to be available for him to make his grocery purchase he was told â€œUm no sir it takes approximately 3 days for your bank to processâ€ at which time he now was a little upset and asked if he could just go and grab the items on the pick up order and then they could finalize the order in the system and she â€œstated sir you are not an employee of mine correctâ€? He stated no and â€œwhy would I let you shop my store under a pick up order thanâ€ be stated so I could purchase my items because other wise I will have to wait for the funds to be available in my account and she replies well Iâ€™ve already refunded you so the transaction is done have a good day and walked away from him. I was so embarrassed, heart broken and just over all enraged at the idea that not only has she treated a customer in such a way but an elderly customer that was clearly struggling. She said some of the most disrespectful things to him in a tone that I would not speak to my worst enemy in, I will not be in Florence ky Walmart again, nor will my friends or family after this, yes we may just be a number but if enough of us take a stand we can make a difference and hopefully Walmart will take notice at the corporate level amd make some changes."
36,43702,Kate Bevington,17/01/2021,Walmart,I went online for tvs. Stated for the I want is 184. at Wal-Mart in St illwater Mn says in stock. It is Not in stock in any store I've contacted. FALSE ADVERTISING.
37,43703,nancy burrill,17/01/2021,Walmart,Always out of stock. No communication from customer service. Just cancels the order without explanation. I will not order online with Walmart anymore because they are always out of stock. The same is true for pick-up from one of their stores. If you want an item go in the store and see if they have it in there. Save yourself the aggravation. Walmart is always out of stock. Itâ€™s ridiculous. Iâ€™ll shop at Target. And Amazon. Donâ€™t take out the Walmart+. Itâ€™s a waste of your hard earned money since your unable to get half of what you try to order. Amazon is never out of stock and you can get Amazon Prime and other benefits from Amazon Prime. Donâ€™t waste your time and money with Walmart.com and Walmart+.
38,41748,Tammy,17/01/2022,Walmart,I placed an order online. Got an email today starting it was delivered. Photo showed a yellow door facing. Nor my place. Mine is brick. Customer service agent- Edward said the first time I called a Mr. Campbell was on the order with all My info. Then he stated Liz Miller was on the order. Refused to transfer me to a supervisor & He hung up on me. So I recalled. and John Walmart agent asked same questions wouldn't transfer me to supervisor. Someone is using My info. Which is Identity Theft. Walmart charging my card and delivering things to another address. Insurance fraud. DO NOT SHOP ONLINE WALMART. THEY ARE A BUNCH OF CROOKS!!!!! I WILL NEVER SHOP THERE AGAIN. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
39,41749,Five Stripes,17/01/2022,Walmart,"I bought a Christmas present for my niece from Walmart. They took my money and nothing ever showed up. I am unable to claim my money back, despite leaving messages. I am in the UK and there is no number to call except a really expensive (from the UK) 1-800 number which I can't afford to call. $40 stolen by America's richest family."
40,41750,Tarek Sakhaoui,17/01/2022,Walmart,Wrong order received. No customer compensation. I will receive an order from another clients that I am not sure will keep my products at the right temperature. Customer support doesnâ€™t know anything else to say except sorry. Same problem with the supervisor
41,41751,Ken Covert,17/01/2022,Walmart,"DON'T! DO! IT!....The free trial went great, but after I paid for it the service turned into CRAP!.... They said they were out of stock for items they had, but were too lazy to go to the deli to find them and I went there after I made an order and saw every item they said was out! But that's nothing.... Here comes the best part.... I'm disabled and have cancer and I order 4 to 5 gal. of milk a week and it's pretty much all my order...I went to order my usual and it said everything was fine, except for the milk....Now it's not EBT eligible and they are trying to charge it to my MC....MILK NOT EBT ELIGIBLE!!!!!?????....BS!!! and you CAN! get a refund too!... They'll tell you it's non-refundable, but like I told them...IF IT'S NOT WORKING, IT'S DAMN SURE REFUNDABLE! And they refunded it and said it would be a one time deal.... LIKE I'M GOING TO SCREW MYSELF TWICE!...I was told by someone that they don't really want to do a delivery service, but they are trying to keep up with Amazon. They are useless and so are a lot of their sellers....BEWARE! of their sellers... They have better one's on eBay! ... and that's not a compliment either. It was great on the trial, but when it got bad,it got REALLY! bad!"
42,41752,aseel alyas,17/01/2022,Walmart,I made a purchase online and I received it was not pleased with it so I send it back and this was back in begging in November 2021 and still havenâ€™t got my money back. I have made Several phone calls so many emails and nothing yet. Make sure you donâ€™t Buy anything from Walmart.com cause you will run it to same problem as I did.

44,47125,Daaimah Vazquez,18/01/2018,Walmart,"Walmart does have just about the lowest prices online! One of the things I love most about Walmart is the top-notch selection of unique professional vendors, you honestly get more selection from their online stores than their bricks and mortar. Walmart stays true to traditon with low and matching comparable prices, and the delivery is very quick. I have always gotten my order exactly has promised, and sometimes before I expect it! Its a great website with all the bells and whistles. It offers a tried and true shopping experience."
45,46879,Sgirl,18/01/2019,Walmart,Wal-Mart. Well I have to say a three out of a five. Do they have what I want yes. But tired of waiting a hundred years to get checked. No I'm not using self check out I hate it. Something never goes right when I use one.
46,46880,Lucy Evans,18/01/2019,Walmart,"Mine was damaged upon arrival, it would never turn off, also the hose adapter leaked like crazy so I had to plug it and render it unusable.  The cleaning part was great, I used 1/4 of the soap and my clothes still smelled great; I totally recommend it, but the build quality... not so much."
47,46881,Harley Rider,18/01/2019,Walmart,"Tried to order a $16.99 cushion, but when I clicked on to change color price jumped 25% to $20.99. After receiving nothing but lip service from Customer Service I pulled up the next site shown for the product on Google. All colors were $16.99. Contacted Customer Service again. They refused to match THEIR OWN PRICE on the first page that comes up for the product nor the other retailer's. For $4 they've now lost me as a customer and the approximately $5,000 in annual purchases I make with them. I'll NEVER shop at Walmart or Walmart.com again."
48,43692,Kyle Clark,18/01/2021,Walmart,"If I could leave no stars at all I would. Walmart is horrible. From the opiod lawsuit burying them alllllll the way down to trying to get a successful grocery pickup. Ordered groceries, was told will be ready on Saturday. Its now Monday and I am finally able to pick them up after endless excuses along with a random employee claiming to be a manager that was later found out to be...just a regular employee posing as a manager. Got our groceries and a large chunk of them were missing. Called them and they said they didnt receive that part of the order even though I show the charge on my bank statement. So we never got the groceries and then had to call and 1800 number to get a refund. This has taken a total of 3 days with an imcomplete order and Walmart not giving our money back. Its pandemic time. At this point many stores are offering pick up services. Looks like I'll be taking my business elsewhere and never going to Walmart again. I hope you guys are reading this and absolutely tank under the weight of lawsuits and simply better businesses that actually care about their customers."
49,43693,Rohry Beckham-Pearson,18/01/2021,Walmart,"I remember when the first Walmart Super Centers opened in the 1980â€™s in my area. They were a hit, competition for Target and truly a one stop shop! The service was excellent, the products were good (produce), and the prices were exceptional. However, 20 plus years later what an absolute horrible place to shop. The customer service is abhorrent. The people working there are disillusioned, believing snide comments and no clue how to help you is the norm. Trying to return something without a receipt is nearly impossible. The products and food items are poor in quality. Trying to fulfill an online order for pick up proves to be as unsatisfying as having a 10 year old â€œrun to the storeâ€ for you. At this point in Walmarts existence I donâ€™t think Target has to worry about competition. While their prices may be a bit higher, Iâ€™ll pay more for the customer service."
50,43694,Ashley Schmidt,18/01/2021,Walmart,Instore not so bad but NEVER order online if its a third parry seller you will not get your order and will be out the money as no matter how mant calls you give customer service they will not refund the money
51,43695,Jack Bennett,18/01/2021,Walmart,"Walmart is the most dishonest company I have dealt with. They are trying to be like and compete with the largest online retailer but they have fallen flat on their back sides. I purchased a Xerox printer on January 8. I paid for it and they were quick to take the money from my account. I got an immediate email advising that my order will arrive between Jan 12 and Jan 15. I got a second email the next day advising that my product has been shipped and it will arrive on Jan 15. Today is Jan 18. I checked the tracking number. UPS shows that the label was created but the goods was never shipped. UPS does not have possession of the goods. Yet Walmart's website shows that the goods were shipped. Liars, thieves. DO NOT DEAL WITH THEM. It will only cause you inconvenience."
52,43696,Patrick Nakaula,18/01/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a hoverboard on November 25, 2020 a birthday present for my daughter. This is before Black Friday. I paid $30 for shipping it stated I should receive by Dec.12. I call customer service on Dec 6th, to check on my item because it states that itâ€™s still being processed. She confirms that everything is good and it should be on its way. I call back Customer service a few days after the Dec 12, because it hasnâ€™t come in. Itâ€™s noted delayed, and itâ€™s still being prepared. I confirm with them that I have no intention of canceling my order, and that I wanted clarity upon the status, because it says itâ€™s being prepared. Customer service has little no no knowledge of what is happening. So I choose to wait. Christmas comes and goes.. nothing. New Years pass.. nothing. January 11th 2021 I receive an e-mail stating that they have canceled my order, this is without my consent. I call customer service, he sends a message to his manager, and tells me that I will receive a call within 48 hours. For the record that call, was like the birthday present for my daughter, it never came. Not once did any Associate follow up with me since I placed my order. But they did not compromise with me, or give me much option. But they have the audacity to cancel my order without any consent. This will be my first and last time to ever go to Walmart.com a truly horrible experience. And it has discouraged me, to shop at any Walmart."
53,43697,Amber Lamb,18/01/2021,Walmart,"I gave it only one star cause thatâ€™s the lowest that I could give, this whole experience has been sh** I ordered a printer for Walmart.com I will never again order through Walmart.com I still havenâ€™t gotten my printer they steady giving me the run around if my printer isnâ€™t here by today I will be canceling my order all together from now on I will deal with Amazon."
54,43698,Sue M,18/01/2021,Walmart,"If you shop on Walmart.com they will hold your money in your account ""so they can make sure you have enough"" then they cancel the order for ""safety"" without explaining why and the money is on hold in my bank Took a week. They blame the bank. They said its what all stores do. NO! No other stores do that. Talking to customer service is even more aggravating. They say they will escalate the issue then a ""manager"" emails me, says there was an error that happened when my complaint came thru and wanted me to repeat the issue to her from the beginning. Worst customer service ever! I will never shop online with them again"
55,43699,Felix,18/01/2021,Walmart,"Someone told me that Walmart had good prices on their eyeglasses. I went to Stuart on Federal HWY and purchased a pair of glasses. From the first day, I got them I notice that the lenses were cheap glass. A few days later the glass had scratches. I couldn't understand why. Then I notice more scratches and now I can't use the glasses anymore. Garbage, don't waste your money there $405.00 for garbage."
56,41747,Busaba,18/01/2022,Walmart,"I was @ Plymouth Wal-Mart this morning to return a phone case I purchase over the weekend, the case didn't fit, I was told the customer services dep wasn't open till 8 am, I said to the cashier I will get what I needs and be back later to return my phone case, as I enter the store in the front I saw a big case of Nugenix vitamin so I grab a bottle due to a great price ( so I thought) I got to the register the price was double, I called over the cashier who was very nice, she said she will have a manger do a price check, came by a woman and a man, the man said to me you didn't see the price? it's on the other size of the box? it said $ 27.88? you should have seen it? ( btw it's rang up for 28.88) why didn't you? I am not going to override it! why should I not my problem! wow! what are you talking about? why would I going all the way to the back of the box where the merchandise wasn't even sitting there? are you an idiot? do you know how to put out products? have you been a manger before? or are you an idiot? why would I walk around a box where the merchandise wasn't even sitting there for a price? doesn't even make sense? Please explained that to me? What a rude person"
57,47124,Pat Obrien,19/01/2018,Walmart,i love walmart we are at walmart everyday
58,46878,Jerry,19/01/2019,Walmart,"Ordered a tail light for a lexus on December 27th. Still had not come by January 18th. First got their supplier; they gave me double talk. The parcel was promised Jan 15 but it was kicking around San Francisco, San Pablo and Sacramento from Jan 3rd through Jan 4th and reported transferred to the post office Jan 4th then the trail went dead. Contacted Walmart again today on their useful chat feature. First they blamed the contracted supplier. I said, ""but I bought it from Walmart!"" Then they promised to escalate my problem and i would get a call next day. On Saturday? Huh? I was then passed to a resolution specialist who offered a refund, but she would not contact the supplier to have a replacement expedited to me in Hawaii. So I accepted the refund (which she said I might receive in five days) and ordered a replacement from Amazon within 10 minutes which will arrive January 31st. I have some faith that Amazon will not try to give me double talk and a runaround. Walmart should have just gotten me replacement product. I can see i was a fool to order from Walmart. I won't make that mistake again. They didn't care about me, and they don't care about you. The can be counted on to do just the legal minimum and not one dollar more. Somewhere deep within the bowels of Walmart someone must know that when you burn out a customer, he/she is going to contaminate on average ten potential customers. This is a well known statistic. Get your customer the product they ordered, offer them a gift card, do something...but don't just hang up on them! My order number was 6321882-933723 dated Dec 27, 2018. You are not going to threaten Amazon with this kind of cheap-jack operation."
59,41745,Robert Pryor j,19/01/2022,Walmart,"I placed 2 orders online, and they canceled. W no further The second one they pieced it out.ugh The food was for 95th surprise party thst they ruined"
60,41746,James Smallwood,19/01/2022,Walmart,"Bought Goodyear tires through Walmart online. Was sent tires that were manufactured 4 years prior to installing on the car. Tires went bad after 12,000 miles (rated for 60,000 miles). Walmart says they have a 90 day return policy. How does that apply to tires. Customer service is horrible, can't understand person on the phone. Was told that if tires were bought at Walmart Tire Center with tire hazard they offer there they would have prorated with new tires. These tires were not available through the Walmart store. Very displeased with how this was handled but I guess Walmart doesn't really care as shown by their reaction to this matter. Will go elsewhere for our tires."
61,41739,David Beers,20/01/2022,Walmart,"Ordered 2 rotating party lights. One was fine the other had already been opened, wall adapter was missing and the light was broken into 2 pieces.....

62,41740,David B. Frank,20/01/2022,Walmart,"I got my vaccines - both of them at Walmart over a year ago. I am now trying to access the digital record so I can travel for a job and had to create special permission for the pharmacy. I respect that, HOWEVER!!!!! They are using some 3rd party ID verification service that is preventing me from creating an account since ""THEY"" say I didn't answer the questions correctly. Best I can tell they are denying me access to my records based on a 3rd PARTY DATABASE which looks to be CROSS-REFERENCING WRONG and/or OUTDATED INFORMATION!! EVEN worse and more concerning are the questions they are asking me appear to have come from questions you are asked when creating a security passcode. This is beyond invasive and unethical. I am so PISSED OFF, I don't know where to start. They offer NO ONLINE HELP and their phones are computer operated which prevents you from accessing anyone to help me access my records which are A) rightfully mine and B) I need them to work!!!!!! I AM SO DONE WITH COMPLIANCE!!!!!  Give me my FREEDOM BACK YOU %!#$^!$^!#^!!!!"
63,41741,Jonathan Singer,20/01/2022,Walmart,"I ordered a TV at walmart.com on 1/14 with a brand new credit card that had never been used before. Walmart cancelled the order without explanation on 1/15. On 1/16, a charge for $321.24 was charged to my card by Walmart. My bank investigated and found out the charge was not made by an individual, by Walmart itself! Walmart committed straight up fraud by charging $321.24 to my card. I sent an email to Doug McMillon the CEO and received no reply."
64,41742,jeremy,20/01/2022,Walmart,"finally was able to order a ps5 . only to have walmart cancel my order due to ""quantity limits"" when i only ordered 1 , which was the allowed limit. Walmart has continually oversold this item and canceled orders, with todays technology , in no way should a retailor of this size be this inept at inventory control."
65,41744,Natalie Ferrish Arsenault,20/01/2022,Walmart,I ordered 4 bottles of kaboom mold and mildew with bleach they were delivered with the top of 2 in the bag unscrewed leaving lots of product spilt in the bag which the package got set on my dining room chair when I got home that evening I picked up the package and found that the product stripped the varnish off my chair. I was refunded for 2 bottles and given a 5 dollar promo code. I should easily be able to repair my dining chair for 12 dollars thanks Walmart. Either packaging should be better or delivery needs help ugh
66,47230,Bri W,21/01/2017,Walmart,Shipping takes forever but overall great company
67,46876,Sharon Reynolds,21/01/2019,Walmart,"I work for Walmart in McDonough Ga I am disappointed in the way the store manger runs the store, I donâ€™t understand how can a big supper center runs out of supply like bags , not even paper towels. How can you perform your duties if there is no bags. Then the customers look to you for answers and you are not the fault. He hides in his office and do not come at the front end to answer any questions the customers have, he leaves everything to the CSM . I donâ€™t think he is fit to be a store manager he is running the store to the ground. I really hope things change. And then a next thing is the hours they gave they are cutting hours how can you pay your bills with only 20 hours a week, it not right.."
68,46877,lawrence johnson,21/01/2019,Walmart,"Walmart is the best online store there is out there, awesome prices and getting real good at fast shipping and always takes care of the customer"

71,43691,Robert Carrasco,21/01/2021,Walmart,Gave my order to another customer at pick up w out asking for ID? Wow then was treated like crap for inquiry I tried on line chat phone and so on! How do you give out groceries w out checking credentials? Wow! No discount or free stuff just bs through out the day I spend $250 a week on groceries here might be a horrible ideal
72,41737,Dark,21/01/2022,Walmart,"You are better off going to anywhere else and saving some money too. The price on the shelf is never correct, you cannot find an associate when you need help. When you do find one, s/he hides. I don't see how we have come to 5 people in a 15,000 sq. ft. building supposed to help everyone. Only now it is worse before Walmart would not hire anyone now no one will work."
73,41738,Robert Nieuwenhoven,21/01/2022,Walmart,Third party seller send wrong item. I ordered Ram memory and got lipstick. Does not work well in my computer. Took hours of emails and complaining to Walmart online and to the seller. Finally I returned the item to the store and after half an hour they managed to refund me the money. Never will shop third party Walmart again. It's a joke when something goes wrong.
74,47348,Sherae X Roberts,22/01/2014,Walmart,"I just came from this Walmart located on the corner of Parker and Custer Road in Plano Texas.Yesterday I left a message for my primary care doctor requesting that he fax a refill of Klonopin for me to this walmart pharmacy . I wasn't sure if he had received my message in time, so since I was at an appointment today with my specialist, I asked her if she would write a script for klonopin for me. She wrote the prescription for me with no problem. As I was leaving her office I notice she wrote the prescription for only 14 tablets. Also on my way home, the nurse of my primary care doctor informed me that she faxed over a klonopin refill to this Walmart. Since my specialist wrote a prescription for 14 tablets, I dropped it off at the Walgreens Pharmacy on my way home. I didn't think it would be such a big deal because the prescription written by my primary care doctor was for a quantity of 20 tablets. The prescription written by my specialist was for a quantity of 14 tablets. An hour later I went over to Walmart to pick up the prescription that was faxed by my primary care doctor. When I got to the pharmacist she started talking about the prescription I had at Walgreens. She told me I needed to choose which prescription I'm going to buy. I told her the prescription at Walgreens is up only for 14 tablets. She said ""it doesn't matter you can't get the same prescription filled. I informed her that I can have both prescriptions filled I just would have to pay one using my insurance and the other out of pocket. She still tried to argue with me and refused to fill the prescription that was faxed in by my primary care doctor  unless I cancelled the prescription that was at Walgreens. I took out my cell phone to call the pharmacist at Walgreens. She then ran to her phone to contact the pharmacist at Walgreens before I could.  Then I asked her, "" do you work for Walmart or Walgreens? "" She pissed me off because her only concern needed to be with the prescription that was faxed to Walmart anything else regarding a prescription at a nother store that's not even Walmart is none of her business. She called the pharmacist at Walgreens and told him to pull the prescription I got from my specialist. Then she rang up the prescription that was faxed ( the 20 tablets ) and I paid using my insurance. Little did she know, I called Walgreens and told the pharmacist that I was going to come by and pick up that prescription I dropped off. When I left Walmart I went straight to Walgreens and got my prescription back. Then I drop the prescription off at Kroger pharmacy. The pharmacist at Kroger had no problem filling the 14 tablet. He wasn't concerned with walmart and Walgreens  pharmacy. He filled it with no argument. I asked him how much will the prescription be with my insurance. I thought at this point he would bring up Walmart and Walgreens like the pharmacist at Walmart did. But he didn't. He looked up the cost for the 14th tablets using my insurance and surprisingly he told me that the prescription will cost me ZERO DOLLARS! If the pharmacist at Walmart wants to work at Walgreens then she needs to go apply there since she so concerned about my business with them. When I come to Wal Mart pharmacy I shouldn't have to discuss my business with other pharmacies. She had no right to contact Walgreens and try to control what I do. What I purchase from other stores is none of her business. I already eliminated CVS as one of my pharmacies of choice because they stolen half of my adderall prescription. I was supposed to get a quantity of 60 but only got 30 and they refused to fix it. Now I see Walmart is another pharmacy I need to cut ties with. Or at least not do business with this particular Walmart since the girl pharmacist can't mind her own business."
75,47318,Jeff K,22/01/2015,Walmart,"Walmart may have decent prices, but is it worth it? They treat their employees poorly, their staff are often rude and unhelpful, and the products are poor quality most of the time. I am not a fan of walmart what so ever, I'd rather shop at smaller businesses that care about the customer."
76,46875,Devra Whaley,22/01/2019,Walmart,"Walmart recently changed in store poilicy. If you have a paper identification issued by your state they refuse to take a paper id. I dont understand how they can refuse a state identification, my fience sent me some money walmart to walmart cause are truck broke down and I couldnt recieve it because the state gave me a paper id until my plastic one could come in the mail and informed me it was a state id and would be accepted the same as my plastic id well thats a lie cause it wasnt walmart wont take it and thats a big corporation. So I use to recieve money and spend most of it in walmart buying food for the week but no more u cant take my state id, u dont need my money either."
77,45734,Steve,22/01/2020,Walmart,Very bad customer service.i have been coming here for a long time. Alexa I think was her name at customer service. She was not helpful and has a bad attitude. Immed She gave she me more negatives than positives about my product and experience. When I went to return my product said she cannot help me because I did not have the Original box to return my product. Am I supposed to have Keep the box for months?this location is off Thunderbird in Surprise. So if you want to return anything keep your box forever.Didnâ€™t even give me an exchange. Walmart has lost me as a customer and will not be returning.
78,45735,Kayla,22/01/2020,Walmart,"I will never order from walmart.com again. I had ordered a swing set for my children for Xmas and it arrived missing all of the hardware. Customer service said they are unable to ship the hardware itself that they will have to resend a whole new swing set where I can pull the hardware out and than return the rest of the Item. Now I have been trying for 3 weeks to send back the extra swing set that I don't need before they charge me again and the shipping label is none printable. aranged 3 pick ups that never came. Keep contacting customer service for a new label and they refuse to email me a new label. Mentioned I can drop it off at the nearest walmart however they will be unable to provide any proof that I returned the item to a walmart store location. I'm so infruriated about this I advise against makeing any purchaces through Walmart,com."

80,45737,Dolores Bailey,22/01/2020,Walmart,"I would give zero if I could. Over a week ago I placed an order on Walmart.com. order was received, however no shipment information was sent, and item was to be delivered next day. Just like to say this item was supposed to be a gift for our grandsons birthday. I called Walmart.com to inquire as to the status of my order no explanation as to why my order got dropped other than an error. Woman said they could place another order, but as soon as it could arrive would be the end of month. I told that would not do. After further research by myself not the walmart employee the item was no longer available. I would not recommend ordering from walmart.com especially if you are in need of an item in a timely manner."
81,45738,Robin Wanless,22/01/2020,Walmart,"Would have given Walmart 5 Stars, shopping Online with the App is Great!!!! A week before Christmas, I ordered a bunch of stuff, used the 2 day shipping. My merchandise came in 2 days and I received everything I ordered. App is easy to use, so far so good. Shopping In-Store not so much, They REALLY need to get more CASHIER'S, I can NEVER shop In-Store if I am in any kind of a hurry, ETC....I will probably stick with the Online shopping. Anyway, the prices are GREAT, shopping Online is GREAT, just get more CASHIER'S!!!!"

84,45741,Bloomington Finest,22/01/2020,Walmart,You are NOT required by ANY law to stop and let them see your items or receipt. I just had 911 called on me because I refused to stop. Im a corporate attorney and this is my expertise. I encourage everyone NOT to stop. No matter hiw many times they ask. Furthermore Walmart has confirmed that if the force you to stop without cause its a violation of your right from search and seizure
85,36282,Stephanie P.,22/01/2018,Amazon Go,"Opening day visit! I'm ready to embrace this Black Mirror future.  The line wrapped around the corner when I stopped by after work, but an employee said it would be about 8-10 minutes, and it wasn't even that long. The store has a capacity of about 79 people, so it's one in, one out for now.  To get in, you need to have downloaded the Amazon Go app on your phone. Display your QR code face-down on the scanner, walk through the turnstile, and you're in. If someone else is with you, they just walk in ahead of you to be included on your bill, even if you split up.  After you scan in, it really is seamless. Browse stuff, pick it up and put it back -- even on the wrong shelf -- and you won't be charged. When you enter the beer/wine area, an employee checks ID, but then you're on your own.  Selection is limited, of course, but they have cold drinks, sandwiches and salads up front, baked goods from Macrina and Blazing Bagels, chips and candy, dairy and juice, and some cereals and dry goods. Of course, they also have Amazon meal kits for $20. Local brands seem to be given some preference: I saw Tim's chips, Tillamook cheese, Starbucks, and Theo chocolate bars, but also regular grocery store brands.  Prices generally seem comparable to, say, QFC. An 8 oz bag of Tim's chips was on sale for $2. A case of La Croix was $3.69. Wine and beer were competitively priced. The grab-and-go meals seemed more expensive, like the $6 tofu banh mi. But everything is clearly signed and you can browse the app beforehand to see what's there, so no surprises.  There's a very small indoor seating area with napkins and condiments and a few chairs, but it's cramped and doesn't have a particularly great view. You might as well grab your salad and go sit by the Spheres, which are just steps away.  Out of curiosity, I did my share of picking things up and putting them back, and the cameras were not fooled. About 10 minutes after I left, a little notification popped up with my receipt. You can even do returns through the app, though I didn't see where in the store that would happen.  Overall, a fun novelty and definitely worth visiting once for the experience. Personally, I prefer the wider selection at the downtown Target, even if you DO have to endure the antiquated horrors of actual human contact and paying for your purchase."
86,36292,Anthony D.,22/01/2018,Amazon Go,"Dropped in while in town for business on its launch day 1/22/19. The store is well stocked, with a good variety of products that include freshly made baked good, sandwiches, juices and all of the packaged foods everybody seems to like.  The sandwiches we bought tasted freshly made, and the prices are good compared to other stores.  I don't know if this concept will work everywhere. This is a very controlled environment. I do like the speed of service when wanting to purchase food, and related items.  Amazon said they will not use this checkout system at Whole Foods. I guess that's a wait and see."
87,36335,Michelle Z.,22/01/2018,Amazon Go,"Amazing! Download the amazon go app, scan the QR code to get in, shop, walkout. EASY! I am. It sure if they will always provide you with the amazon reusable bag or if it was just for the grand opening. Check this out for yourself. You will be impressed. It is all food fun r now but hopefully they will open more locations and have merchandise."
88,36350,Hugo C.,22/01/2018,Amazon Go,"Go for the NSA experience. Opening day for non-Amazon serfs. Line was reasonable. Scan upon entry from the Amazon Go app and enter a world of...fancy convenience store type items. Endless varieties of sandwiches and salads for the worker bees of Seattle. Decent drink selection. Wine and spirits, too oh my! The future is now, folks. Overall I recommend for the thrill of a quasi shoplifting experience without the pesky cops getting involved."
89,36423,Jeff E.,22/01/2018,Amazon Go,Want the quickest lunch stop in the game? This place is it. I've been here several times and try to break records for quickest shopping trip ever. The chicken bahn mi is my personal favorite. The staff is friendly and the food is tasty and fresh. I'm a fan.
90,36454,Haya G.,22/01/2018,Amazon Go,There are more people with selfie sticks and cameras than real food. Very limited variety of products. Go there only if you want to have a cool photo for your social network. Most of the chances that you will not find the groceries you wanted.
91,43686,Lori Roach,22/01/2021,Walmart,I will never order on Walmart.com again. They are trying to be like Amazon and get shoddy merchandise they canâ€™t keep track of or refund. I spent 3 days trying to get a return from a shipment that came from China I believe and was given the run around until I gave up. Donâ€™t encourage this online buying warehouse!
92,43687,Me,22/01/2021,Walmart,"Absolutely terrible experience with buying online, the order was made on January 5th, 2021 and twice they moved the delivery date now to January 22nd, 2021 and I still have not received my order. I am very disappointed that I decided to deal with such a store as walmart. Do not buy anything from them online especially if you buy an expensive item, this organization does not bear any responsibility for your purchase. I paid for the delivery separately and despite this, my purchase has not yet been delivered. Very bad experience with this store and if my order does not come soon, I will have to contact them through a lawyer."
93,43688,Mary Jane,22/01/2021,Walmart,"It was my first time ordering on your online store. I got the item, very well-packed, and nice. It is just the delivery was a day late. I called customer service which is fine except he might be having a bad day perhaps. Overall, I love my jacket!"
94,43689,Chris Edens,22/01/2021,Walmart,"NEVER AGAIN!!! I bought a $129 battery at the store 6304 N 99th, Omaha, 15 months ago. Now dead for third time. It has a 3 year warranty but they say it can be charged up even tho Iâ€™ve fully charged it up with my large 12 volt charger 3 times. Iâ€™m not going to leave my wife stranded again with a dead battery. All I want is a prorated price for a different battery. Iâ€™m not asking for new battery free. I was shocked that even manager Kim said no. All the money Iâ€™ve spent there over the years. NEVER AGAIN!"

96,41773,Deborah Phillips,22/01/2022,Walmart,"THE ELDERLY PROMOTE GOOD SERVICE Walmart is not who they advertise to be in the store or online. For Christmas gifts, I made several purchases online, some Walmart products some seller products. 3 of those seven purchases were returned due to very poor quality, several delayes, and false advertising. While trying to return item instore a extremely awful experience. I had to deal with a printer is jammed a printer won't print trying to other stores with the same excuse or more after three days a back-and-forth I finally went to Walgreen to mail the items off myself. To this very day which is January 22nd haven't heard anything from Walmart no apologies not even an excuse. that says a lot about who they are and what they represent, clearly it's not customer services Clearly revamping is needed and the product services needs improvements. I've been to over 10 different Walmarts, it seems the same type of poor service and unprofessional workers reside. As for online service posting fraudulent and false information on their product quality and their services just to get your business. I would never recommend."
97,46874,Andre Lyons,23/01/2019,Walmart,"I ordered a TV online that was false advertising saying it was a smart TV when it wasn't, so I returned it and never received my money back. How a billion dollar company can still hundreds of dollars like this I don't understand. Will have to take the company and Court."
98,36349,John M.,23/01/2018,Amazon Go,"I popped in here with an Amazon employe before it opened and thought it was an OK concept.  Now that it is open to the public, shopping there is the best bodega / convenance store experience on the planet.  Its better than convenance stores in Tokyo even.  Good selection of fresh foods, junk food, alcohol etc... Look forward to more of these opening and even larger grocery stores expanding on the concept.  Going to any other bodega / convenance  store is like a trip to the DMV in comparison."
99,36451,Slush T.,23/01/2018,Amazon Go,Checked out the opening of Amazon Go. This technology is going to be a game changer. Convenience is unmatched. All you have to do is download the Amazon Go app and link it to your Amazon account. This business model is ideal for the Amazon user in a real world convenience store application. Add scalability...
100,43681,Juliane Diniz,23/01/2021,Walmart,First off the only reason I am giving any stars at all is because there is no such option as â€œno starsâ€.  Walmart has crappy products for ridiculous prices AND they make you pay for taxes AND delivery. I think this is enough of a review to make smart people stay far far far far away from this garbage. I canâ€™t believe I spent almost 3 hours working on a grocery list and they didnâ€™t have most of it so Iâ€™d have to literally start from scratch. So for that you guys can kiss my money goodbye cuz u ainâ€™t getting it
101,43682,Geo,23/01/2021,Walmart,"I ordered several items for delivery to my home. I received an email saying my items had been shipped EXCEPT FOR ONE GROCERY ITEM THAT I HAD TO PICK UP AT A STORE! How does an order get broken up into part delivery and part pickup? I am unable to go to the store. The customer (so called) service online ""chat"" says there's nothing they can do to fix it so I cancelled that item. This is a classic example of what is bad about dealing with Walmart. Too big, too clumsy, unresponsive. Only my 2nd order from Walmart.com and probably my last."
102,43683,Lynn,23/01/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a Bluetooth adapter. It was the wrong one. I asked to return it. I finally got an email, clock ticking, and was told it's too much trouble. So no refund, no return. NO WAY to do business. Hello Amazon."
103,43684,Stephanie McCann,23/01/2021,Walmart,"I placed an order online for pickup. The next day, when I checked my order status, it told me pick up would be ready that day after 12:00 p.m. After work, I drove 30 minutes to pick up my order, only be told that my order was canceled when I got there. I was never notified that my order without a stock. Never again will I order from walmart.com, ever."
104,43685,Keli W.,23/01/2021,Walmart,"Walmart offers the best prices for common goods. Some items are mistakenly described so remember these products. But, except for Christmas, I will always shop at Walmart. Their Pickup people are the best."
105,41743,Tati,23/01/2022,Walmart,"Ordered an outdoor bench and two containers for my front porch. The metal bench was packaged okay but arrived with scratches up on delivery. I didn't bother to complain or return the item because I was tired of going through the trouble again. The two tall Fairfield planters looked great to begin with. We drilled the excess water hole where it was supposed to be and planted two small plants. Throughout the summer one of the containers developed a bulge in the lower half. I contacted Walmart marketplace, they referred me to the seller, who referred me to the manufacturer. The manufacturer told me to check for dropping of the insert, where the soil and plants were sitting on. They said to empty out the water in the bottom part and to wait a few days until the material would reshape itself to the original shape. I was wondering why only one container showed the bulge, though. So, to make a long story short... I am still waiting for that one container to reshape itself. I put artificial Christmas decorations in it after I removed the plants and the soil. Now they're just filled with florist foam and artificial flowers. In spring I'll check again. I won't order from Walmart marketplace again because their products seem to be of mediocre quality."
106,46872,Bessie Carver,24/01/2019,Walmart,Usually I don't like online shopping but its very convenient here
107,46873,CT Boyd,24/01/2019,Walmart,"I don't know, I enjoyed my shopping experience at Walmart online shopping. It was easy to find anything I was looking for. They have a wide variety of products. Good return policy. And pretty darn affordable on most everything. Overall, good shopping experience."
108,45732,Alba Gonzalez,24/01/2020,Walmart,"Wal-Mart is great when it comes to prices...Customer service is an issue..Auto dept. No kind of help, Managers walking around and avoiding this section like the plague.. They don't check on the dept to see if HELP is needed .. Ive been here since 7am when they opened and NOT ONE MANAGER...Walmart in Waterbury Ct. Maybe if they paid some commission per car the employees would be MOTIVATED..Right now theyre having a team meeting at 10 am while phones are Ringing off the hook!!!!"
109,45733,NM,24/01/2020,Walmart,Terrible customer service! Never again will I shop at Walmart! I ordered something on Thanksgiving that had 2 day shipping. The item shipped and was supposed to be delivered the following Friday. It didnâ€™t show up so I called the next day and they said it looks like it was lost in transit and they would re-ship the item no need to return anything. I took that as if you get the original donâ€™t worry about sending it back. It ended up showing up. Now after 2 months I just received an email that they will be charging my credit card if I donâ€™t contact them and have it picked up within 5 days. After calling and being on hold for 40 minutes they told me that I have to return the item and they never told me to keep it. They will get me a call tag or have fedex pick it up because Iâ€™m not sitting here all day waiting for them to show up because I have to work. So now I have to drop it off at FedEx that is 20 minutes away. What was the point to shop online! At least Iâ€™m lucky and didnâ€™t trust them to let me keep it and it is still in they box.

112,43675,Lori,24/01/2021,Walmart,"I placed a couple of large orders online over Christmas. All of the items were shipped separately. All but one of the items was delivered fairly quickly, but one item was marked as shipped, but there were never any updates. I finally contacted the seller who did confirm that the item was never actually shipped, and I was refunded for the purchase. I placed another order that was marked as shipped on Dec. 30, but, again, no tracking updates. I have requested a refund from the seller. My main complaint is that Walmart is now using third party sellers instead of shipping from their own warehouse. I will be using Amazon for online orders from now on."
113,43676,Laura Johnson,24/01/2021,Walmart,What's the point of ordering on line for curbside pickup if it takes them three days to prepare it for pickup. Not to mention the 5.00$ charge for preparation. I have other products to buy today but I've decided to go with Amazon instead. Bye Walmart.
114,43677,Bret Bright,24/01/2021,Walmart,dear walmart: iam a driver that delivers product too your d.c. from time to time I have a great experience. but will not shop at any of your stores anymore use give you all my shopping money but will no longer be treated like a thef for spending my hard earned money at your place. my hole family has boycotted walmart
115,43678,Kesh Mani,24/01/2021,Walmart,"Absolutely the WORST purchase It took WALMART 30 + - Days to get it to me from Mississauga ONT. (Tomnet CA Premium is the Shipper)to Edmonton AB retail pick up location. The Motor is too weak for semi hard spices like All-spice, Cinnamon, pepper corns Dehydrated Avocado seed. Etc. The plastic top is not sealed proof, you can see spice dust leaking from the sides. The Clear Plastic cap gets scratched in the first use, and then it become exceedingly difficult to clean the spice dust in the scratches on the cap without bleach soaking overnight. At best it grinds the spice to a coarse level, not a powder consistency. Ordered Dec 21st 2020, Picked-up 19th January 2021. IF you run this spice grinder trying to get a consistency result, the motor starts smelling like a burning appliance motor. The blades inside have only three teeth's each, the blades are exactly same height (Design flaw) Worst $28 Investment ever bought. It also took Walmart 3 business days to locate it when the website showed it was already in some warehouse of Walmart in Edmonton. Then my order is erased from my account order history. Order number 1508337847434158990091 Tracking Canada Post 2012581019117211 Walmart Sales Order Id: 9182021000454 At the Highest Value I believe this product should be under $10 to the consumer, NOT WORTH the $28 (Clearance price). DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
116,43679,Tricia Brothers,24/01/2021,Walmart,My 17 year old son ordered a kitchen table and chairs set for me for a Christmas present. When we opened the box and started to put the table and chairs together we noticed the corner of the table was damaged. Not only was it damaged but it has a fake cheap wood looking peal for the top of the table and of course there was a tear. Also the chair cushions we received were not the same color as advertised online. My son paid $150 for this table. It is the worst quality table and chairs set for the price he paid. More than likely we won't shop online with walmart ever again.

119,46871,Gabriel,25/01/2019,Walmart,"I came to Walmart to buy a laptop. Me, my wife, and my three kids waited for one hour because the lady at the electronics section didnâ€™t have the key to open, and get the laptop! My wife was with a huge back pain, so we asked the woman if they had the laptop I wanted. She said she couldnâ€™t check and that we had to wait for the keys, so we stayed there waiting! When the keys finally came, the lady said the laptop was out of stock eventhough it was displayed to the customers. I am extremely disappointed with the horrible customer service at Walmart. It isnâ€™t right to display products that are out of stock! Any other store wouldâ€™ve given me a discount on another product but she said it was againts their policy. I told her I could buy the laptop now and get it later, but she said they werenâ€™t able to do this. Itâ€™s really annoying to go to Walmart in the United States and have to try to speak Spanish because there are no attendants that know how to comunicate in English."
120,45728,Ji Young Park,25/01/2020,Walmart,They making so many problems on return and refund money back. I called 4 times to correct amount of money back. They were like full me around. So bad customer service. I Will never Again make order walmart online.
121,45729,Richard Case,25/01/2020,Walmart,"Pathetic. I gave walmart a chance to do business rather than using amazon. The order i placed was available for the same price as amazon, however i was attempting to break from using their services. I learned my lesson. Had the item shipped to store and it was scheduled for pickup on Saturday, now they have no idea when it will arrive. The order will be canceled and the money will be spent elsewhere. You guys are pathetic."

124,36296,Michael S.,25/01/2018,Amazon Go,"OVERALL: 10/10, AKA ""FINALLY I CAN CHECK IN HERE ON YELP AND NOT FEEL WEIRD ABOUT IT!!""  This place is the perfect hybrid of a convenience store size plus medium-sized tech-focused grocery: it has the beer/wine/soda/snacks for your party, plus the frozen/refrigerated foods for your weekend (if you're staying in, that is).  Context: I've been coming here since the beta opened for full-time employees, for almost every possible occasion...  1. night-time munchies, 2. grabbing something quickly for breakfast, 3. a sandwich for a lunch break, 4. buying some batteries for my headphones, or 5. buying snacks for hosting a party after work.  The way this place works is combining computer vision with machine learning and natural behavioural understanding - when you pull something from a shelf, it goes into a ""virtual cart"", which is then submitted and checked out immediately upon departure (caveat: to generate the QR code you need a valid Amazon account and linked payment method).  The review breakdown is fairly straightforward:  1) VARIETY/SELECTION: 10/10. For a place this size, the buyers know exactly what to stock; this is mostly based on customer requests / inquiries, but it's also based on machine learning models, which use data. Amazon is definitely making data-driven selection choices to help drive customer conversions.  2) FRESHNESS: 10/10. The cooks create breakfast sandwiches, pre-made meal kits, and sandwiches fresh, every day, so you never need to worry about stale food choices or options. Plus, the shelves are constantly balanced and re-stocked to ensure that you're always looking at the freshest products.  3) VALUE FOR MONEY: 10/10. The prices are very comparable to the competition; beer/wine compares to the Downtown Wine and Spirits a couple of blocks away, the snacks / groceries / non-alcoholic beverages cost the same as what you'd find at other convenience stores / Whole Foods / QFC / Safeway.  4) SERVICE: 9.5/10. The only major service points are when you enter (need to show employee the QR code you're going to scan), and your ID if you want to peruse / purchase the wine / beer in the back corner. All entry points are fairly frictionless, but I'm docking 0.5 stars because there's been times when nobody was at the wine/beer section (pre-public-launch) to check IDs, which is dangerous if it ever happens post-launch.  5) PRICE: 10/10. It's hard to argue with the prices in general - Amazon Go has regular sales on products, all of which provide meaningful value. For example, Pringles lightly salted is $1.25 right now, where its normally $2.00; that's a 37.5% discount! Even the normal priced selection is reasonable - a non-breakfast sandwich ranges from $5.25 to $7.75, and there is a great selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.  Yes, there were lines on the first day... I went this morning at 9:30am and experienced no such wait. The inside of the store definitely seemed more busy than I was used to (and people were generally more rude about blocking aisles and throughways, argh), but I don't feel like the post-launch experience is going to differ that much from the 30+ times I visited during the beta.  The only noticeable difference now is that there *has* to be someone to check ID at the wine/beer section during all open hours."
125,36416,Nic D.,25/01/2018,Amazon Go,"While it was a unique experience to leave there without interacting with a cashier, it was no fun to leave there with food poisoning as well.  Stuck to snacks, bakery goods, yogurts, beverages, anything microwaveable, etc and stay away from prepared sandwiches and salads."
126,43669,A Bauer,25/01/2021,Walmart,"The customer service that has been experienced here has been wonderful. The problems that some are having must be location-based. Many bash Walmart due to where many of the goods come from but, where do I go if I really need something? WALMART! The products may not all originate where preferred but I am not a purchasing or regulation expert and am not sure under what circumstances are involved. Another example of me trusting my government to keep me informed if purchasing practices are shaky. Walmart usually has what I need and I will happily grab some of my groceries if I happen to be at a Super Walmart. I have very little experience with their online ordering but it must be trustworthy as many seem to utilize it. They always come through for me!"
127,43670,Jacqueline Fields,25/01/2021,Walmart,"I was at Walmart, Florissant, MO location on Friday, worst customer service of my life. The culture of the store is suc that they could care less about assisting you in any manner. You basically have to track down employees for assistance and even then they duck you and pass the buck to someone. So I needed a cartridge for my printer, so I proceeded to electronics. Once there, no one was available to assist me, although there was 2 employees behind the counter in full view tapping on their phones. So I got in line for assistance, not to check out. By the time the cashier got to me for assistance, she proceeded to get her coat and purse and leave without ever saying anything to me (I guess her shift was over). Okay, so Iâ€™m standing there in disbelief, and the other cashier finishes his last customer and asks me if I needed help, of course he saw what had just happened with my cashier. I said yes and told him I needed a cartridge for my printer as I had the basic userâ€™s guide with the brand and number on it. So he walked me the area and pointed to the cartridge that was compatible with the price under it. By the time I got back to the electronics line to pay for my cartridge, the one cashiers line was long with customers in line with baskets of groceries, not electronics. Now you would have thought that the cashier who left his register to assist me would have walked back to the register to ring me out but no he went to do something else more pressing. So because the line was extremely long with ppl purchasing groceries, I assumed I could get checked out quicker up front in the regular check out/self checkout lines. When I got up front, they only had maybe 3 lines open and they were so long, they were back in the clothing section and same for self checkout. So I went back to electronics to make my purchase since that is what I purchased. While standing there in line to be waited on, one of the employees behind the counter on his phone, proceeded to walk up to cash register to check out someone who was not in line, but just walked up to be waited on and was checked out, He finished ringing him out and stepped back off register and got back on his phone. After all the grocery customers were waited on, it was finally my turn, my cartridge wasnâ€™t the amount it said it was located, it was double, okayyyyy So I purchased it anyway just to be done only to get home, and loaded into my printer. My printer said it needed an additional black cartridge, so of course Iâ€™m pissed. So I took it back today to get my money back because it obviously wasnâ€™t compatible and was told they donâ€™t take anything back open when it was your associate who told me that was the cartridge. Worst experience as a customer ever and I will NEVER do business with you all!!! Walmart has made trillions during the Pandemic and this is the type of service theyâ€™re giving with no resolution!! Yâ€™all SUCK!! Go somewhere else, Target, dollar store etc!!ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬"
128,43671,John Damian,25/01/2021,Walmart,"Well I'm So disappointed more than a week now I filed a complain though the phone with walmart customer service, and the lady told me that someone is going to call you 3 to 5 days to Follow up with your complen!!! So far there is no one called or emailed me !!! Again thanks walmart for supporting your customers and Allowed your managers to Insulting ,and treat us like stupid that way at Walmart Located at north plainfield New Jersey. ðŸ‘Ž"
129,43672,andreana stephens,25/01/2021,Walmart,"Why is it that some Walmart employees greet you at the register like their life is ruined and it is your fault, when you donâ€™t even know them. The Walmart in Bartow Florida has some of the most Ignorant employees that I have encountered to date and I travel all 48 and Canada. Listen people if you donâ€™t like your job and donâ€™t want to deal with the general public at large then stay home complain and abuse the reflection in the mirror, people are just trying to get their groceries and personal affects!!"
130,47311,Katie,26/01/2016,Walmart,"I've made many purchases on Walmart.com. This year was the worst. Many things were out of stock, customer service department was very rude, my orders arrived late and one item was lost and I was told they never had it in Stock when the website clearly said, ""in stock"" and let me go through with my order. It was a hassle getting a refund and just down right irritating. I don't recommend buying from them during the holidays or buying anything very expensive. Ordered a $300 electric car for my daughter and it arrived damaged. It took them almost 2 months to finally pend the purchase as well, which means my checkbook was unbalanced for a while causing frustration. Just beware..."
131,46868,Kimberly Parks,26/01/2019,Walmart,I purchased a camera from Walmart and I went to return it and told I only had 15 days to return it and it had passed. I didn't see that posted anywhere on line when I purchased it. They don't stand behind their products and the stores has went downhill
132,46869,customer,26/01/2019,Walmart,"I love online shopping from Walmart. My problem is when you go into a Walmart Store and there are only a couple cashiers open. They push self check out which is absurd. I feel like getting on the intercom and saying All members of Management to the front to check, please. Listen to your customers Walmart. No doubt Sam Walton is spinning in his grave."
133,45723,Anne,26/01/2020,Walmart,Has anyone else noticed Walmart has changed its water prices to make you go in store to get the water instead of the grocery pick up? Itâ€™s a couple of heavier grocery items ( heavier than a 10lb bag of potatoes) that they have put as only in store or priced it ridiculously high ( ice mountain 24 pk for $9.88??) you just lost a repeat customer Iâ€™ll go to Target Aldi or HyVee Thanks but no thanks!!!! They didnâ€™t jack up their prices to force you to change your busy life schedule and come in for $5 water!!!! Bye Walmart!!!
134,45724,Vetty,26/01/2020,Walmart,If I could provide a zero I would. Walmart stopped a payment on their store issued gift card for a television. The wont compensate me for their error. It will take another 5-7 days. They have478. 00 if money and I'm still waiting. Their consumer is horrible. Don't order run!!
135,45725,Isa,26/01/2020,Walmart,"If I could do zero stars I would. Stick with Amazon, dont bother ordering through Walmart. You order something that says 2 days, then you get an email it wont be in for a week. They cancel items your expecting a day or 2 later. It's horrible! Amazon you order, it shows up! I didnt know ordering through Walmart could be such a hassle. Tried 3 times now. I'm sticking to Amazon from now on!!"
136,45726,Robert Lundberg,26/01/2020,Walmart,They always have what I need at a a decent price.
137,45727,Deborah Braswell,26/01/2020,Walmart,Shopping ok. Most employees helpful and courteous. Tried to enter chance to win sweepstakes. Entered information requested. Informed me time limit expired. 2 days since I was at neighborhood market. Seriously??
138,36314,Beau S.,26/01/2018,Amazon Go,"The tech behind this is beyond understanding but, it is a fun place to shop and feel like you stealing something until you get the bill 10 minutes later. The prices are ok and close to on par what a usual convenience store prices are. I do like the local pre made sandwiches and baked goods. They also have full meal kits available under $20 like Blue Apron."
139,36351,Taylor K.,26/01/2018,Amazon Go,"Simply incredible.  Came in today without even realizing that it had just opened to the public a few days ago. There was a size-able line out the door but it only took a few minutes and gave me time to download the Amazon Go app needed to enter. You also get a  pretty durable and water-resistance (and free) grocery bag! I was picturing a convenience store with candy and advil and what not, but it turned out to be a mini grocery store with fresh sandwiches and even wine/beer. You just scan in and it recognizes when you pick items up or put them back. 5 minutes after leaving, you'll receive a receipt to make sure everything checks out right and you simply swipe on an item if you've been wrongly charged so there's little worry to because charged for an item you didn't actually get.  I'm not sure if it's cut-out to be someone's regular grocery store, but I think it's a unique experience that anyone should try to go visit at least once if they can. It definitely seems helpful for those working in downtown and needing a quick lunch. Put this on your bucket list! It won't disappoint."
140,43666,Gloria OrdoÃ±ez,26/01/2021,Walmart,THE ABSOLUTE WORST COSTUMER SERVICE Iâ€™ve seen in my entire life!!! God help you if you ever have a problem with Walmart because they donâ€™t care and they wonâ€™t help you!!! And also be careful with â€œmembershipsâ€ they might sign you in â€œaccidentallyâ€
141,43667,Lacey Hooks,26/01/2021,Walmart,Every order has been wrong or broke or rotten! Never received or contacted on orders. I will never use them again absolutely ridiculous! I have images and emails to prove every single word of this is true. F- worse I've ever used! Do not recommend!

144,45720,ROXIE,27/01/2020,Walmart,"Walmart is where I go for almost everything I need, but which store I spend my money is the problem. I have tried to not be so critical of the one located on North Ave & Cicero.. Well, I tried...i can no longer continue to spend my money where i see workers on their phone Facebook, facetime, and or talking..when I ask for assistance I've been told ""over there with pointing finger"" where is over there..its unfortunate that those who are dedicated and professional are attached to this mess.. not all of the workers are disappointing but most This store needs to be revamped with better training for staff and or better staff I'm sorry but I will be driving far from home to another Walmart"
145,45721,Larry H,27/01/2020,Walmart,"Below is a copy of one of the threads of conversation with Walmart Customer Service. I placed an order via their website for a Christmas present. I requested that they be delivered to my office to avoid porch pirates. The package was sent via FedEx. We receive deliveries everyday from FedEx. On this day we had a new driver and after receiving accepted the shipment the driver stated that he could not find all of the packages due to Christmas volume and would return once he had unloaded more. He never returned. Walmart and FedEx have both rejected my appeals. I suggest that you order anything via the Walmart website at your own peril. They obviously could care less about you.

146,45722,Gumby,27/01/2020,Walmart,"Today is 01/26/20. I have been dealing with a single purchase issue with Walmart.com since 12/12/2019. Long story short, they double charged me on a laptop and have not refunded me my money. All of the bull spit I have to deal with is not worth making another purchase from Walmart.com ever again."
147,36378,Mark W.,27/01/2017,Amazon Go,It's simply amazing... works as advertised. The only problem is it makes you hate standing in line everywhere else!
148,36442,Tyler S.,27/01/2018,Amazon Go,The staff was very helpful. This store is beautiful. Amazon knows what they are doing. Every aspect of this store was perfect. Love the fresh selection as well as the the pantry essentials!
149,36144,Jason B,27/01/2020,Amazon Go,Novelty shopping experience Would you prefer to never interact with humans again? If so Amazon has you covered because they created a store (and society) where you can get closer to that dream. This was the one small benefit of visiting Seattle which overall is a soulless city.
150,46867,Farren Flynn,28/01/2019,Walmart,"Do not buy walmart prepaid visa. They use greendot corp as their card. you can not get in touch with a live person without many hours of effort. I bought a card for my son going to basic training in the army so he had money to buy supplies with there. The card was stolen prior to his registering it. We attempted to contact someone to block the card. By they time we got a live person the money was gone. I have filed a police report against the person that stole the card. Walmart customer service is useless as they only have the registration numbers, no contact number for their card. Might as well throw your money to a guy on the corner, at least you know where it went that way."
151,45718,Lisa Ingram,28/01/2020,Walmart,Being Assisted by an amazing wonderful young woman that I find to be of a great value of Walmart Sarah Clough. This young Woman really should be Recognized for her kind heartedness and the Loyalty of what she does in her position at Walmart words are just lost for her .she's approachable and very willing to be of nothing but the greatest of help to others when ask .Not very many like Sarah Clough of Walmart 2055 Louden Road Concord N.H.
152,36406,Stephanie V.,28/01/2019,Amazon Go,The most amazing place ever !!!!!  It was so fun walking in - grabbing what you want and then just walking out.
153,41534,Carol Bernal,28/01/2022,Walmart,"First of all, I just want to make it clear that I love Walmart, it's my favorite store. Love the merchandise and the prices and the convenience of getting everything I need in one stop. So today as I was waiting on my receipt to print out an employee came to me and told me that another employee was going to come and take picture of my receipt so that they could do my survey. At first I didn't catch on to what they meant since I was in a hurry but as I was walking to my car it clicked! Are they seriously going to do everyone's survey? What's the reasoning behind this???"
154,41535,Teresa Fletcher,28/01/2022,Walmart,"I had placed an order online. Delivery date was to be the 17th of January. I get notice on the 17th that it was delivered. There was no package delivered! Showed that it was placed on front porch In a city two hours away. On Jan 20th, I contacted corporate customer service the individual said that it showed that the package was lost and that I would be getting a refund. I was informed that it would take between 24 to 48 hours for it to show up in my bank account. By the 26th still no refund. I called corporate again. The individual said yes the package was lost but there was nothing regarding refund in their system. This person said they would put in for my refund to be sped up and that I should see it within 24 to 48 hours in my checking. Here it is the 28th and still nothing. So I call again. This person said that I would need to call back in 2 days if my package doesn't arrive by then. At this point my patience has run out. I informed them that my package was to be delivered on the 17th and that I have been informed twice a that I would be getting a refund. This person put in for my refund of $24.54 but in two different amounts that add up to $25.54!?. And I was informed it would take up to 10 business days to show in checking!! This is ridiculous!!!"

I asked for a supervisor, they say its not possible to transfer.... okay, they got to call you back within 24hours....no call back was made at all. When I recalled 3 day later, they said they couldnt leave voicemail because my voicemail wasnt setup....wow...funny. I will never shop online again with them and do not recommand."
187,45716,John Vick,29/01/2020,Walmart,Rip-off... Blood pressure medicine that was once on the 4 dollar list is suddenly $220... rip-off... And they don't take the GoodRx card... Safeway pharmacy did take the card and cost $22 ðŸ˜Ÿ
188,45717,robin smith,29/01/2020,Walmart,online buying is good but there are too many items that aren't from US and you don't know who they are until you click on them.
189,41531,Kevin V.,29/01/2022,Walmart,"This is purely a Walmart review, not their marketplace nor its' sellers.  I removed 1.5 stars because multiple times I called to speak to a customer service representative who says they are doing something then doesn't. I order A LOT and this is the third time that I called because things never arrived or it was damaged in transport, and out of the 6 separate orders that had issues, only one was resolved. I don't have time to waste and paying someone to not do their job only raises prices. I had to call again last week to follow up on the resolution and I have to call for a third time to follow up AGAIN because it's still not resolved. this is not a matter of me being impatient, it is them not processing the issues properly.  I removed another 1.5 stars because FedEx in my area is constantly damaging products, including my Walmart orders. FedEx will report this and in their tracking details section it will say something along the lines of: 'Damaged. Handling per shipper's instructions.' Well guess what... Walmart's instructions are wait for the customer to contact them about the lost or missing package. They are not proactive in anyway about your order not getting to you.  Both of these issues are customer service based and I would expect more from a company with a market cap of 380 Billion (with a B) ."

I had to call again last week to follow up on the resolution and I have to call for a third time to follow up AGAIN because it's still not resolved. this is not a matter of me being impatient, it is them not processing the issues properly.  I removed another 1.5 stars because FedEx in my area is constantly damaging products, including my Walmart orders. FedEx will report this and in their tracking details section it will say something along the lines of: 'Damaged. Handling per shipper's instructions.' Well guess what... Walmart's instructions are wait for the customer to contact them about the lost or missing package. They are not proactive in anyway about your order not getting to you.  Both of these issues are customer service based and I would expect more from a company with a market cap of 380 Billion (with a B) ."
220,41732,Unknow,29/01/2022,Walmart,I bought some pillow at 34 dollars and some change on line and the the same company had them for 15 and some change I call Walmart.com and they said they had to contact seller to see about price adjustment first of all I didnâ€™t buy them from them I bought it from walmart well they reviewed both post and it was the same pillow same size just worded different seller response was.

221,41733,M,29/01/2022,Walmart,"For a big store, worst customer service in existence!!! Worst in store and online customer service. They should figure out how not to be so horrible before someone else takes thier place and monopolizes them. There are better places to shop!"
222,47310,Jacob Thomas,30/01/2016,Walmart,Very happy with this website. I always find my things here.
223,46864,John Brand,30/01/2019,Walmart,"I have been a Amazon prime member for a number of years .. Recently I have been shopping on walmart.com And for the most part had been very Satisfied ..On January 23rd, I ordered in RCA computer tablet and on the 26th, received a toy instead ..I called and told the associate about my problem and she said that they would send another one out and I would receive it by that 30th ..I asked her since it was their fault that I did not receive the tablet by the date they promised, if they could expedite it and she said no.. To amazon's credit, in all the years that I have received merchandise from them, I have never received the wrong item .. Plus, I have been able to receive items the next day after ordering from them if i wanted it. If Walmart is going to compete with Amazon, they had better improve their customer service ..Very disappointed !"
224,46865,Margarete,30/01/2019,Walmart,"Online shoppers beware,  Did not receive my goods and company claimed to have delivered it"
225,46866,E.,30/01/2019,Walmart,"Online Shopper Beware! I recently purchased items online. I waited for notification that my items arrived and are available for pickup. I emailed customer service and was informed the items were lost in store. I proceeded to call the store directly and I spoke with the manager. He informed me that Walmart has no way to determine if the online purchases that arrive daily from UPS are accurate. There's no report that tells in store Walmart associates that they should have 10 boxes on Monday, 8 boxes Tuesday, etc. Therefore it's just by chance that you actual receive your online order. Now that I'm aware of this, I'll definitely shop at Amazon as they conduct due diligence and I'm guaranteed the items I order."
226,45710,Vivian,30/01/2020,Walmart,I ordered an apple phone from walmart market place which did not work after a month. It took me 6 weeks to find what to do. They just play ping-pong with you. Finally they told me the product is from market place. Never buy anything from Walmart's market place you will be dealing with third party and good luck with that. This is like cheating customer to buy on Walmart.
227,45711,cade fix,30/01/2020,Walmart,have no local walmart. so i have to pay a $15.00 toll + gas to get there.i have used walmarts web site to see if an item is in stock.i have learned at best this is a crap shoot.so i call both the walmart in linden nj and in edison nj.so as not to waste time and money.at best both stores customer service is a joke.no matter how many times i call.you never get past the 1st person no one ever answers in any dept.really just disgraceful.customer service on a scale of 1-5 does not register.
228,45712,Cheryl Sterling Penner,30/01/2020,Walmart,The tire department was great. They helped me get the oil and filter I needed and were quick ringing me up. I've also had new tires put on there and they did a great job when I came back with a tire light on months later. Aired me up and I was on my way quickly.
229,45713,Megan Wilson,30/01/2020,Walmart,I've had good experiences except for having tires put on in bellefontaine ohio. They did not put them on right and one came off while driving! After many runaround I was finally able to at least get a district manager to give me a new rim.
230,45714,Jennifer Brazzel Hascall,30/01/2020,Walmart,I orderd a set of 5 3 oz bottle of shower gel for a Christmas gift. I recieved 1. Notified Walmart right away and they said they'd notify the seller who would contact me. Never heard a thing. Contacted Walmart again - same result. Will stick wtih Amazon for good customer serivce from now on.
231,36216,Brian F.,30/01/2019,Amazon Go,"Fraternizing with the enemy or scoping out the competition? Either way, I needed a couple groceries for a birthday party later that night and I realized that I had never been to an Amazon Go store before so I wanted to check it out.  To get started download the app which is what you will use to enter the store. You just pick up an item and somehow it knows to add that to your cart. And if you put it back it knows to remove it from your cart. Then you walk out without needing to talk to cashiers or dealing with lines or paying. You just leave!  I was skeptical about how accurate my total bill would come out to be and the employee I talked to told me if there was a discrepancy I could dispute it on the app itself. I got an email not long after containing my receipt and it was accurate.  I really felt like a kid in a candy store in terms of the technology used and how everything worked. I didn't catch if there was any noticeable price difference between this place and normal grocery stores. Most of my time was just figuring out where everything was so it made for a quick shopping trip."
232,43664,Joyce Schmidt,30/01/2021,Walmart,"Walmart online (walmart.com - NOT Walmart grocery) has a new service...1-2 day delivery with free shipping on items sold by/delivered by WM. At first I thought this would be an excellent new service for some non- perishables and other items being that I pay for grocery delivery (1 1/2 years now.) However, they CONSTANTLY send SEVERAL Door Dash employees to each deliver 1 or 2 items - RIDICULOUS! Then I have to tip each person (and I AM going to tip!) I've placed 4 orders using this new service and 3 times I had 2 people deliver 1-2 items off the order, and one time FOUR different drivers bringing 1-2 items! WM NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CONSIDERING PEOPLE DO TIP FOR DELIVERY! This new service might have free shipping, BUT IT'S COSTING ME MORE IN TIPS THAN I PAY FOR THE ITEMS!"
233,43665,Nick Faraci,30/01/2021,Walmart,"I entered the store and was wiping my hands off with the disinfectant wipes I turned around to throw it in the garbage can at the time I was looking at wipes for sunglasses so I continued into the store and this guy is basically be groping a female worker and you can see she's uncomfortable and he starts saying what are you a f****** thief trying to steal that s*** I said excuse me I'm walking in the store as I was going to steal something when I run out the store and I'm not a thief I work hard for what I have I just got robbed for $15,000 worth of tools. He continued to swear me find me a worker came up and yelled at him and was like what are you doing you cannot speak like that then you were here to make sure nobody pick something and runs out the store. After a little bit of manager came up and said they've had many problems with this guy but still have them fired them and then told me that they were going to call corporate and fire him. I waited never heard nothing who I called corporate to file a complaint animals are three different women approach me and told me that UK made them feel very uncomfortable I never scared to say something I felt so bad for them women having to work under them circumstances. Then the self-checkout machine was all messed up it took me probably an hour and a half just to pay for my stuff I end up missing the Bills game I know it's the first time we could have made it back to the Super Bowl and over 25 years. I had to end up selling my Bitcoin and losing out I'm around $100 probably because it was down at the time just so I could take that and put it on a Walmart card to pay for my order because my big card they said wouldn't work my Google pay they said don't work my unemployment card said it didn't work when I use them still to this day I was trying to explain on their machines myself do you want to let me use another machine I sat there for hours missing the game live alone having to sell my Bitcoin when I was down 10% today and from what I've heard the manager has not fired this guy. I will never return to the store. After getting robbed when somebody says you're a thief and you work so hard for everything you've gotten in life it hurts so bad I literally had to see my therapist and talk to her because I couldn't sleep I was so embarrassed and I'm there all the time and now I drive a half-hour further so I don't have to go to that store and be embarrassed.. on top of losing my Bitcoin money and turn into horrible day and I'm still dealing with this but I'm waiting on a email from corporate to see what they are going to do."
234,46863,Niteprowl2,31/01/2019,Walmart,"Ordered dressings for a wound that I have had. Sent a bottle of Dakin's Solution but nothing eles in the box, even though packing slip said the dressings were in the box. I contacted Walmart and they said they would investigate. Never got back to me. I checked the credit card I used and they credited back the cost of dressings but never contacted me that they were doing this. I needed those dressings badly and had to order from another vendor. Had to pay extra for rush shipping."
235,45708,Tracie Bauman,31/01/2020,Walmart,"I ordered a bath pillow from Walmart.com. It was $19.99; the pillow I received was not the brand or pillow and cost $8. I called and they said I needed to contact the company that manufactures it, as they donâ€™t correct any problem with someone elseâ€™s products even though I bought it on their website. I contacted other company by email. I sent them a picture and order# of the pillow I ordered and what was mistakenly sent. They sent the exact wrong one again. I called and explained to customer service, they told me to take it back to nearest store for a credit. When I did, they said no that I needed to contact the other company. I was so mad...they refused to listen. Finally one of the girls said if I would buy a box to ship it back she would start a refund credit. I had the pkg it came in but they insisted I had to buy a box. I am DONE with Walmart. Another associate found a box and shipped it. I am still waiting on my credit. Walmart.com does not stand behind everything it sells...BEWARE!!!"
236,45709,Chuck,31/01/2020,Walmart,We like to get our prescriptions there and order online for lower prices on some brands. They need more help.
237,43657,Maureen Bismark,31/01/2021,Walmart,Driver delivered groceries to wrong address! Worst service ever.
238,43658,Harry,31/01/2021,Walmart,Purchased two corner cabinets online from Walmart. We thought we could trust their brand. One cabinet came with a broken leg. Called Walmart every day for six days and was told to WAIT for the third party seller to contact us. They never did. Walmart was terrible about it. We are now stuck with a 283 dollar broken piece of furniture. We will never trust Walmart again.
239,43659,Erinleigh Davis,31/01/2021,Walmart,The only good thing I can say is Walmart delivery accepts ebt payment. The cons of Walmart delivery are not knowing if everything ordered is going to be delivered until it's too late to approve a substitute. Absolutely no communication with shopper or deliverer. Trying to figure out if a receipt is the updated one is difficult. I've used the service three times and each one has been confusing from requesting refund for missing/incorrect items to providing a proper tip. I will continue with it for the ebt acceptance but I cannot rely on them if I really need something important. Twice I was left without catfood and once without a furnace filter. Both instances I could have had a replacement instead.
240,43660,Jourdon Washburn,31/01/2021,Walmart,I dislike Walmart in general. I have been trying to get a job at this place and the assessment is meant for you to fail. What is it there for if all itâ€™s going to do is fail you. Iâ€™m better off not answering the assessment.
241,43661,Jeni Kusherman,31/01/2021,Walmart,Zero stars. I was supposed to pick my groceries up from 5 to 6 it is now 749 and Iâ€™m still in line waiting for my groceries. Go anywhere else until they fix this process. Waxhaw Walmart

243,43663,Jezreel Chitty,31/01/2021,Walmart,"STOP REQUIRING EVERYONE TO SHOW THEIR ID FOR ALCOHOL. My father who is in his 60s.... couldnâ€™t buy alcohol because my 22 year old roommate forgot her ID. Heâ€™s my FATHER!!!!! Do you ask for a kids ID if their mother wants to buy wine????? I just bought my wedding dress and wanted to celebrate with my DAD and ROOMMATE with a bottle of cheap champagne. On a side note, what the HELL stops someone from going in the store to buy alcohol and leaving their underage friend in the car??? Nothing.... You can read this review and laugh thinking Iâ€™m a bratt, but Iâ€™ll be damned if I donâ€™t write this because frankly Iâ€™m pissed. I had a really exciting day ahead of me and I waited 20 minutes in line for that... for my DAD that travelled 2 1/2 hours to share this day with me and wanted to be sweet and buy me Champagne.

However, Last week was ESPECIALLY SPECIAL! I was having difficulty reaching the Ozarka Water, of 16oz 12 Pack. Therefore, I called an Employee, Who was nearby and He came immediately. I asked him his name and he responded, Patrick. I looked at His Badge; Which stated: Walmart Associate.  I Apologized to the Young Man for interrupting his job, But asked if He could reach the Ozarka Water for Me and explained, My Doctor didn't want me straining to reach for items; Stored vat Such Height.  Today, I went back to Walmart to shop and decided to get another 4 Pack of 16oz 12 Pk Ozarka Water and to My Surprise, All of Them were stocked low enough, For My Convenience...

300,46492,Bill Warren,13/10/2019,Walmart,I would have give them a ZERO if it were possible. My wife bought Kroger ranch dressing 5 days ago and the expirations is 15 months ago! I tried to go thru the walmart website to file a complaint but just before the last step it would not go any further! It is a one hour drive from my house to the nearest walmart not to mention the time I have to spend in that Ridiculously slow line. I cannot believe they put a product out that old!!  MY BADD!! I asked my wife twice where she bought the product ands she said Walmart and I said are you sure and she said yes! It turns out Walmart does not sell Kroger products. turns out she bought it at Ralphs ( I called Kroger after I found out) I want top clear this up because I unfairly ( and not knowingly blamed Walmart ) when it was Ralphs all the time on Hwy 79 in Temecula CA

308,36213,Caroline T.,13/10/2019,Amazon Go,"Decently priced grab and go items, with a free side of entertainment (watching folks 'attempt' to walk out without being charged for something, and seeing people use Amazon Go for the first time).  They do have some staff scattered throughout the store, mostly to restock the inventory (they are consistently restocking/on top of things), answer any questions, or to check ID (for alcohol purchases in their back area.  There's a variety of items in the store from drinks, hot food entrees for lunch, breakfast items, sandwiches and salads, sweets, and even some random items for the kitchen (sauces, spices, etc.).  I love their hot entrees, a perfect lunch solution on the days I don't bring my own. If you don't work in the area, or you're just visiting, once you exit the store there's a little sit in area with microwaves to heat those entrees.  The one downside for me is most of their food items either expire the day of visiting, or the next day, so it doesn't give you much of an option to stock up if you're looking to.  Favorite entree so far as been their sweet potato curry ($8-ish with tax), which is spicy and perfect for a gloomy day."
309,46995,Humberto Esteves,14/10/2018,Walmart,"I bought this item and received on 09/10/2018. When I started to open the box, I notice that the table was broker. Returned and they received back on 09/17/18. I'd called 4 times with no solution to receive my money back. Last time the person was very rude telling me that they had a problem in the system and I have to sit and wait."
310,46458,Andrea Grady,14/10/2019,Walmart,I would give them zero stars for not proving security at the cross walking in to shop. Everytime i go im nearly run over by cars speeding throu. The do not yeild to predestrians at all. Customers spend money in ur store so why not protect ur investiment.
311,46459,anna farris,14/10/2019,Walmart,lately I have been shopping less at walmart due in part to the fact that our local super center seems to shifting from a store to a warehouse where the stockers seem to outnumber the shoppers and appear to enjoy blocking aisles and making it harder to find items.Like an ever growing number of shoppers I have been making more purchases from online stores (not walmart) and doing what most retailers do by ordering directly from overseas suppliers at a fraction of the cost.Walmart seems to be trying to play catch up with amazon and others but failing.

They also refused to transfer me to a supervisor. This is the worst customer service

I'm a regular shopper at Wal-Mart. Megan's attitude and of lack of professionalism made a bad situation worse.

319,36280,Genevieve W.,14/10/2018,Amazon Go,"This is such a weird but cool concept. I really didn't know what to expect going in. You literally just activate your app for Amazon Go, pick out what you would like, and then walk out with your purchases. Wow, what sorcery is this. It even recognizes things you put back. Staff was amazing and there are a ton of different food choices!! The prices are not too bad either!"
320,36231,Dennis C.,14/10/2019,Amazon Go,"Ok wow, this is the coolest concept.  It's almost too much for today's consumption of grocery shopping.  Its a strange concept to walk into a grocery store, grab what you want, then just walk out and not speak to anyone.  I literally downloaded the app outside the store, walked in and bagged up like 15 small items, then headed for the door.  To get a tall can of beer I had to show a guy in the back my ID, but no biggy, I'm only like 45ish.  Love it, going to hit this place every time on my way back home from work.  Only thing I didn't like, very limited selection of foods.  Overall, nothing bad to say, its just ahead of its time I think. People may not be ready for something so advance and game changing yet.  We will see."
321,42193,Aaron Galindo,14/10/2021,Walmart,I called in to Walmart today because I have not received my refund for an item I have returned she proceeded to tel me that she can see where the item was scanned in at customer service and return label was printed but not used when I asked to speak to a supervisor she became extremely agitated and said it wasnâ€™t a valid claim because I have no proof that the team was returned even though she said it was scanned in but customer service at the Walmart associate didnâ€™t finish the return so Walmart got its product back and Iâ€™m out $200 dollars I truly hate Walmart and I wonâ€™t buy anything else from them
322,42194,Richard,14/10/2021,Walmart,"The grocery pickup is a awful to try placing an order. It is so confusing - I go to check out and half of the stuff is shipping and half is for pick-up. I just want to shop grocery pick-up, not everything in the Walmart universe. Please change it back because this new app is ridiculous."
323,42195,Mark Thomsen,14/10/2021,Walmart,Bring back the old application.  The new application wonâ€™t scan clearance prices and shows item out of stock when Iâ€™m holding one in my hand.  Iâ€™ve cut back shopping in store browsing for deals and now only get the essentials snd leave.
324,42196,Rachel Melton,14/10/2021,Walmart,Your new Walmart app is garbage. You cannot scan anything to find the accurate price. The grocery pickup is a horror to try placing an order.

325,42197,Sky,14/10/2021,Walmart,"The most awful company for online orders and returns. If you ordered from the 3rd party, they make you return items yourself!!!! 1st, you have to go stand in their long lines at ""customers service""with one or maybe 2 very, very slow moving clerks. Then they'll tell you that you have to contact the 3rd party customer service and ask for return labels yourself, and after they give the instructions, then you have to go to the post office to send them back!!! What a pathetic and horrible customer service is that? Ordering something online and literally seconds later get notification that they're out of stock. Or not being able to see the full screen of your shopping cart. Have to constantly scroll up and down, to see if you ordered everything you wanted and make sure you didn't order something twice. Always having ""delayed"" shipping after they already told you it was coming much sooner. There's NO excuse for this giant company to be so incompetent and greedy. I mean you are a multimillion dollar company, get your freaking act together!"
326,42198,Shaina,14/10/2021,Walmart,Manny was extremely knowledgeable and concerning about my online order issue. It was not delivered on the day it was scheduled and the store said I had to wait on a refund in order to get my food because it was through a third party. Manny apologized and informed me the store gave me false information and it should have been delivered through the store it self which it was but it was delivered to the wrong address. He refunded my delivery fee and my grocery order and re ordered my grocery's for me to pick up tomorrow he was outstanding.
327,42569,JJ,14/10/2021,Walmart,"Im thinking this whole app update is a joke or some kind of test to see how many customers they can run off...I'm not believing that wmt actually rolled out this update aka disaster as terrible & user unfriendly as it is. I went to the store today & since you can't use apple pay or samsung pay I as usual when at wmt attempted to use the app....a complete disaster..Wal mart changed the app recently & I didn't realize how terrible it was until I simply wanted to switch to a different stored card to make a larger purchase...""neither could anyone in the store who works there"" & it no longer tells you which card you're paying with when the payment scanner appears..Wal Mart needs to just let customers pay with the samsung pay or apple pay if they're going to make a mess of their ""wal mart pay""..jeez..the customer service number is HORRIBLE...terrible ...just terrible..they dont even deserve 1 star..very frustrating...I walked around in store for 30 minutes after first attempt trying to get the payment method switched & finally gave up..I just left the cart/item at the register..I ordered on Amazon on the way to my vehicle. I also noticed if you place an order that's less than $35 for pickup at a local store WMT charges an additional $5.99 for that why would anyone pay wmt 5.99 just to pick up in store???....they're getting worse and worse, smh."
328,46993,Caleigh Mcdonald,15/10/2018,Walmart,"I have had to start using Walmart.com because our Walmart in Corsicana Texas is just awful.

329,46994,Angela,15/10/2018,Walmart,"5451867-587242  Where are the ethics of allowing Overstock.com to be allowed as your market place provider. At What point does Walmart take accountability for this? Walmart pointing the finger to their market place. The market place should have ethics and know their faults, and how to correct them. This is poor business.  I had one week, of no one calling me back. In this time, I spoke to chat support, daily, asked for escalation. I've asked for call backs. higher rep, at one point set up a conference call with me, and never called me for the call or even when I waited an hour, I then called in, got escalated. Was never transferred to ""Tammy"". Was lied to by the escalation Rep, asked to be transferred to manager, was told no, they'll call me back in 24-48 hours. It's a week later and not person has called or treated me with decency. Chat support, customer via email, has stopped replying to my emails and sends me a seperate email of a $25 dollar voucher that I need to speed $45. and mind you this was after I spoke to a higher rep asking them to make this right. When they offered a higher deal, then just blew me off. I need justice on this.  All I keep hearing is someone else pointing the finger, and a small, we can make it right on another dining set, however I'll have to pay way more out of pocket to get the quality that I ordered and was taken away Unjustly. 1) Offer Sale 2) Acceptance of the offer by buyer. check 3) Consideration in the form of payment. Check All those were done and I have screenshots to prove. At this point Walmart or market place needs to take accountability. You do have access to this table set. It's still on your website!!!! Under a different heading with an $800 + price increase.  Badly treated customer"
330,46455,fgf,15/10/2019,Walmart,"Walmart2Walmart. I would never use this service except for the fact that a couple friends don't have bank accounts and this is the only way to get them money. Its unbelievable how difficult they have made it! Even when presenting your state issued drivers license they require a physical address. The address on my ID is a PO Box. Why they have a huge issue with this is unknown not to mention ridiculous! I don't see what an address has to do with sending/receiving money with a proper ID. Too difficult to deal with & not worth the trouble. Will never use again, anyway its basically obsolete having Zelle!!"

336,42184,Joseph Frades iii,15/10/2021,Walmart,"Shopping NIGHTMARE! FIRST, to park. Understandably, handicap parking should be up front, as well as a space for local law enforcement and decorated Veterans. YET Walmart has now elected to add to the up front parking spaces, pick up for orders to go. Okay, I get it, have to transport the orders out by cart to the online customer. BUT/YET, those IN STORE personal shoppers are the most RUDE persons I have encounter. They will NOT move so you can shop, have attitude. Perhaps what they may not realize,.... I believe in time Walmart will go completely AI (artificial intelligence). Just like the robots that provide for inventory and cleaning, they too can select and item, put it in a cart AND transport it out to an online buyer. SO, for all those rude personal shoppers,... your days are numbered. Walmart will go high tech, eliminate you, and Walmart's will be an giant artificial online shop and pick up location if not already ordering online to be delivered. Walmart will survive and make even higher prices. For me, I will move my shopping to Albertsons, Smiths, Vons and pay the higher price, for the HIGHER STANDARD they offer the consumer. End of share."
337,42185,Rebecca Ann,15/10/2021,Walmart,Terrible experience with Walmart.com. If you have any problems with your order just chalk it up as lost money and forget about it. I know Amazon has not been up to standard but so much better than walmart.com
338,42186,Kayla C,15/10/2021,Walmart,"I updated my payment method to use my walmart credit card. After submitting my order, I noticed it took the payment from my debit card! I called right away to see if they can just update my payment method (since Amazon can do this, I thought walmart could too) they told me I had to cancel order and send individual messages to the items that are a private seller to see if they will cancel! So now I have to wait and see if they will even cancel it. And in the meantime I have a large sum of money that I'm waiting to get back into my checking account. What a nightmare. I should have just stuck with Amazon like I usually do. I will never order from walmart.com again."
339,42187,Elle,15/10/2021,Walmart,"Ordering groceries is an absolute nightmare. I used to be able to just check my regular items off my list and be on my way, but now there are seemingly hidden delivery fees even though I paid for a membership to not have these fees, and thereâ€™s no easy way to differentiate between the items that will ultimately tack on the fee. Also, why are my orders being separated into shipping and delivery? I have kids to feed and this has made my life astronomically more difficult. I will no longer be using Walmart+. I have to use Instacart which is so much more expensive but at least theyâ€™re upfront and keep their word on waiving delivery fees for members."
340,42188,Jason,15/10/2021,Walmart,"Terrible update, horrendous online customer service, and super UNRELIABLE. Theyâ€™ll draw the money out of your account before the order is even delivered, and then when they screw up and leave me hanging for days for an â€œexpress deliveryâ€ that never showed, now thereâ€™s a hold on my $250 I needed for food this l week. So big thanks to Walmart for almost making me miss rent and making me live off ramen noodles for a week. Iâ€™m done with this company Iâ€™ll never spend another dime in one and Iâ€™ll never make the mistake to trust delivery form them ever again."
341,42189,Judah Kessler,15/10/2021,Walmart,"I ordered 2 identical items on Walmart.com & when received they were the wrong size. I could tell by the packaging alone. So, UN-OPENED, I placed the 2 boxed items into the shipping box & began the ""return process"" online. The page wouldn't allow me to process one return, I had to process each item separately and print TWO separate return labels. But BOTH items were shipped to me in only one box. I contacted customer service via ""chat"". The fellow obviously had no working understanding of English & promptly cancelled the pick-ups for both items. He told me I'd receive one shipping label via email. Ah, what, in fact, he did was he cancelled the pick-up & made it so that I HAD to go to a store! The closest being about 45 miles away! I contacted customer service again, via ""chat"", and again, though I clearly stated my situation, this fellow repeatedly asked ""You want a refund. Right?"" paying no attention to anything else I explained. I asked to ""chat"" with a supervisor, the reply was ""It'll take me a minute to get a supervisor."" Fine. The NEXT response was a message telling me that it appeared I'd ""left the chat"" and was ""disconnected""! OK, I telephoned and, yes, again, English was completely alien to the person on the other end. ""I see you cancelled the pick-up..."", ""I see you cancelled the return..."" ""OK. No problem, you can return both items to the store."" When I said that I couldn't get to the store and that's why I'd ordered online in the first place I was told ""There's nothing I can do about that."" Well, now I see that ALL correspondence concerning my order has disappeared from records and I'm unable to to even TRY to return these items. We're talking 60$ that I'm out now and from what I see, I can't expect a refund OR a return at a store that ""doesn't do online returns"". Nothing short of a scam here, a ploy. Walmart has the money, I have useless merchandise. I should have remembered my previous review which also indicated intent to defraud. Well, fool me twice but never thrice."
342,42190,Keschel Sherman,15/10/2021,Walmart,Placed a order over 2 weeks ago. Received all but one item. Had (3) different delivery dates but still didn't receive my item. Not happy at all with this experience. Been checking my mail EVERYDAY for the past 2 weeks. Mighty funny all my other items arrived except 1. Kinda of strange to me. I could have ordered the item elsewhere. Wal- Mart was a waste of my time. I was being patient. Now I'm pissed off. Thanks for the inconvenience Wal- Mart
343,42191,Karen,15/10/2021,Walmart,"Walmart needs to improve the quality of it's produce. If I am paying for delivery, I don't expect to receive moldy or poor quality produce. They now expect me to drive to the store to return these items when I'm paying for delivery. Really ridiculous. Also, their policy as far as cancelling time sensitive items that don't arrive on time is absurd. I understand that items may be delayed every now and again, but for it to happen 2-3 times in a row is just insane. I've wasted a lot of time with clueless customer service associates and frankly I'm frustrated. My time is valuable and I shouldn't have to jump through hoops for paid services and quality produce. I should also add that their new web interface isn't just user UNFRIENDLY, it doesn't work on several browsers. I've been a Walmart customer for a very long time and have literally spent thousands of dollars there. It's time to look elsewhere."
344,42192,Melissa Bishop,15/10/2021,Walmart,"This is a complaint about walmarts new website. I bought Dearfoam moc toe ladies slippers. They are my size it says but they are about 2 sizes too big. There is no way to write a customer review on the walmart website. In addition, other customers reviews do not show. I wish I could have found out they run huge before I bought them. And, you cannot return them to the store. ""We don't do website returns"". What a crock."

346,44422,Alexander Yulaev,16/10/2020,Walmart,"I bought tires following walmart.com suggestion based on my car make and other specs. All walmart auto shops were closed for 4-5 months due to pandemic. So, I had to wait until they are reopen. When I brought tires to a shop, it turned out that the suggested tire size was wrong. I tried to apply for a refund/exchange by calling walmart.com customer service and initially got an approval for that with the instructions how to apply for a refund online and return tires in a local store. However, the walmart online service did not allow me to file return due to expiring 90 day policy. In store, they also refused to accept tires. I called walmart.com customer service 3 more times but they refused to accept wrong size tires. It looks like walmart does not respect their loyal customers, refusing to fix own faults, giving faulty recommendations to buy wrong goods. I was also surprised that all customer service representatives were not consistent of how the good can be returned giving faulty and confusing instructions. I had to waste $160, 5 hours of my time, 1 gallon of car gas, 40 min of my cellular call balance to understand that walmart would not fix its fault and let down. Unfortunately, at this time I had a bad experience having business with walmart and did not expect that walmart ignores patriotic customers. Alas!"

373,42168,Shiree Reid,17/10/2021,Walmart,"I hate the new website shopping, not to mention all the drop shipping places they've added to it, so half the time you aren't buying from Walmart at all. Most of the time they don't ship out anything, they offer all their value products pickup/home delivery only. So I decided to become a member of Instacart instead. I can communicate with my shopper while they are shopping through text message, I can get quicker delivery, and I can order from several stores during one shopping experience. I rather pay higher cost for products, then get cheaper cost products with subpar services and inconvienced website."
374,42169,vklipa,17/10/2021,Walmart,Do not shop at Walmart. They have become more expensive than regular grocery stores. Also they have stopped delivering to many addresses. Walmart is no longer a bargain. It is more like a monopoly just like the rest of Americas' big corporations.
375,42170,Rueben Vangleason,17/10/2021,Walmart,Bait and switch. I have made two online orders in the last month. As the delivery date approaches all of a sudden you get a notification that there's been a delay. Instead of telling you that they are out of stock and they'll be a delay before you order. Eventually the items may arrive. For a few dollars more you could have picked them up at a brick and mortar store. Walmart.com and their affiliates suck. I won't be ordering from them anymore.
376,42171,Greg Dorn,17/10/2021,Walmart,"I order online for the convenience of not having to drive to the store since most days I work very late and would have to leave early. So now the newest fee scam is by Wal-Mart itself. Place and order which in itself can be nightmare on Walmart.com. Trying to select items to be shipped can be a challenge. But a little perseverance this task can be done. So I place in cart, remove, place in cart remove since many items are out of stock for delivery. So this little scenario goes on for 15 to 20 min to order 6 items or something to substitute the out of stock items, which you will not find out till you go to cart to check out. So, I finally get done and found the 6 items I would like delivered and check out. All these orders go to my business during the week, since I'm there 18hrs a day. But Wal-Mart, the local warehouse, and their oh so intelligent people decide to change one, 4 dollar item, to local delivery through DoorDash on a Sunday. I get a call that they are on their way to deliver one, 4 dollar item, instead of shipping with the rest. Apparently they change your shipping/delivery options at their will once you complete your checkout and they have your address. OK, now I'm pissed I have to drive 20min to go to work on a Sunday. I just left at 0230, now 1100, and thought I could have some time off, but no! On top of the inconvenience of driving to work, they now have charged me $8.59 for a below minimum delivery fee, 7.99+ fees and taxes. WOW, unbelievable how ignorant this is on their part. I could have driven to walmart for 25cent worth of fuel, but who shops in store for 1 four dollar item if you don't need to go? Unreal!"
377,42172,Janet Carter,17/10/2021,Walmart,Walmart has become the worst place to order online ever since they did the new update to their system. I have ordered online for delivery and 3 times have they been delivered to the wrong apartments with the same apartment number. They accused me of lying because the picture showed the apartment number but I look out my door and there's no groceries. Of course you can't prove it to them so they think the worst. Like I tell them I'd rather have my groceries than a refund. I got a refund for the orders I didn't receive but now I'm banned from making online orders even if I'm picking them up I cannot order ever again. I'm sure many of you have faced the same issues but be warned they will cancel you from placing another online order if your order gets lost and they refund you. It's ridiculous how they treat their customers when it's they're fault for the terrible system update. I'll never shop with them again on to another store.
378,42173,Al Cook,17/10/2021,Walmart,Walmart's online shipping it does price gouging they use third-party retailers to complete your orders when they don't have items in stock they try to charge me $133.97 for shipping on two items that were worth under 40 bucks what a rip off this is nothing more than price gouging I went to Walmart not marketplace not ram productions I went to Walmart's website to order food not marketplace or ram productions and this is just actually another Walmart store that they're sending it from so their price gouging this is ridiculous I'm done with Walmart you're ripping people off poor people
379,42174,rhonda blackburn,17/10/2021,Walmart,I cannot scan for correct pricing with the new app and when I asked for in store help the associate told me â€œ oh thatâ€™s because we donâ€™t want you having access to that infoâ€ I said â€œ oh?â€ She said â€œ yes itâ€™s because when things go on clearance they are marked out of stock â€œ Every single thing I scanned that was on clearance said â€œ out of stock â€œ and I was unable to see the price. I had a cart full of things that I left there because if I donâ€™t know a price Iâ€™m not going to be able to decide what I want to buy or what I CAN buy. Thanks for nothing new App!
380,47325,Jay,18/10/2014,Walmart,I love Walmart but their online checkout is such a hassle. 90% of the time my order goes through and gets authorized with PayPal or my CC but the order doesn't complete on Walmart. So I end up having about 3 -4 pending charges on my account until it finally goes through. CS is useless as well. Walmart needs to revamp their site and get new techs.....I doubt its fully secured.

Like what the hell, upon calling a refund request the guy was like it is suppose to go back to warehouse first and then we will give you your refund. If it is already lost how it is suppose to go back to warehouse man give me my refund or ship my item thats it . These guys just put you in between of nowhere I will say you guys again their service is most pathetic service in the world. Never ever order anything online from walmart."
385,44412,Kelly Nelson,18/10/2020,Walmart,If you are contemplating ordering somthing from walmart.com you would be better of throwing your money off the nearest overpass thereis no accountability from the chain for items ordered. I ordered what was supposed to be a tv(wasnt what i recieved). Returned what i recieved to the store unopened to be told thak you you should be credited somtime 3+ weeks from now.

386,44413,Marcass Carcass,18/10/2020,Walmart,"Management has repeatedly threatened me despite my not having done anything malicious. Corporate management, the Ethics Committee, and the head store manager, don't care to take such a problem seriously, so I have to shop online and have my groceries delivered, but now, they're even refusing to serve me in that sense, after having spent over an hour gathering around $300 in items, I'm told they are too busy to check me out, even a week from now, and even if I designate someone to pick up my order, they have repeatedly refused to check me out, so what am I to do now with no food after having wasted my time shopping for food?"
387,44414,Nancy L Stokes,18/10/2020,Walmart,"I live in North Idaho, do not drive at night and especially in bad weather. The nearest Walmart is an hour away. I shop on line for this reason. One other reason is one of their pharmacy techs addressed me in front of a packed Walmart with threatening accusations. THIS particular store is going downhill. After this episode, I took a chance and placed an order on line to pick up due to the last interaction and Covid. After driving an hour to pickup my order, they had just a couple of the items in my order. Very disappointing to have wasted hours and not take home important necessities. I then ordered three items online on Sept 14th to have delivered to my home. Two items were cancelled without them contacting me. My last and final order was placed on September 19th, of course including the same unreceived items that were in my last request. After waiting for SO LONG, I receive an email on October 14th that said ALL ITEMS are delayed. I cancelled that order. I AM DONE. WALMARTS negative actions out weigh the good and being someone who has spent THOUSANDS of dollars in their store, they still insult and treat their customers like crap, like no bodies. They need to remember, they are supposed to be there for us. I guess it's easy when you're driven by greed and have ice water in your veins."
388,44415,Nae,18/10/2020,Walmart,Ordered a digital game online and it still hasnâ€™t came in asked them for the code they donâ€™t have the code which doesnâ€™t make sense because if you order something they should have access to it so they can give you what you need then they keep saying itâ€™s processing on average how long does it take
389,44416,mrmikegm,18/10/2020,Walmart,This is my follow up from my 1st review yesterday. Of course I didnâ€™t get my refund today at the store cause there was no merchandise to return because I cancelled the order. The manager from customer service said go to the store and tell them to give you the full amount. No wonder why the employees are awful with managers like that. So I had to call back customer service back after my in store ordeal and now I have to wait another 48 hrs for billing to call or email me back. Walmart you suck. How can this company survive with their idiotic ways. Unbelievable!!
390,44417,Regina Crawford,18/10/2020,Walmart,"Shopped at Walmart in altus, Oklahoma. There were only three cashiers working and had long lines. You could either stand in line an wait or check yourself out and wait. I think that if you have to check yourself out you should get a 20% discount. Because it seemed they didnt care if ther were long lines. Walmart used to care about there customer and made sure if there were long lines they would call up associates off floor to help!!! I know I worked for them. Also there produce has been were there is mold on it like strawberries and small oranges like the cuties or what ever brand they use now are bad."

They tell me that it's going to take 3 days for Customer Service to get back to me. I asked them to cancel my order after waiting a month and a half! They then tell me to wait 3 days to have my order cancelled! W$F Walmart. Get your s#hit together. I told the lady that I will NEVER be ordering from walmart.ca. I suggest that you don't either.

I needed a new bed as I did not have one due to a moving situation. When I called customer service they said they couldnâ€™t do anything and I had to contact the manufacturer(which doesnâ€™t make any sense). I tried to contact the manufacturer but it was a bull crap process that also lead me no where and they had no customer service people to speak with. Walmart is awful! I hate shopping in your stores and the one time I tried to buy online I got a broken bed and no resolution or follow through for rectifying a broken product WALMART SOLD ME. If you sell a product you should be responsible for fixing a simple return OR replacing the damaged parts. I GOT NEITHER! All I got was a broken bed I spent 400$ for. Your online customer service department is a complete joke everyone I spoke with was rude and had no follow through, Iâ€™ve received better customer service for broken products Iâ€™ve purchased at the flea market lol. I called back 4 times and was told they would process a return but got the run around each time I called after that and never had a return remotely processed or started. I eventually gave up and now I have this broken bed and will be buying another after I just spent 400$ on this piece of junk bed(which could have been a quality pine wood bed HAD IT NOT ARRIVED BROKEN). Donâ€™t shop Walmart online itâ€™s a scam."

I used the Walmart $10 tire plan so service was free. Honestly they need more help because I arrived at 6:50am and by the time the door opened at 7:00am 4 people were waiting. Howard took the stress out of the situation, said it would be fixed right away, turned out it was not a sensor or a puncture but a leak around the rim. Problem resolved with issues. Thank you again Howard. I will always buy my tires here and always get the $10 per tire repair deal. So worth it. No arguments, they just fix or replace. Service is very customer oriented and it shows. Thank you again. I appreciate it. Sheryl"
400,46447,Kaley Arquette,19/10/2019,Walmart,"Walmart has terrible, terrible customer service and their employees know jack squat! I needed help in the electronics system and there was a lady that helped me but sold me the wrong thing! I then tried to return it and was gave more wrong information from another employee. At this time the manager was called down and I had discussed my situation with him but he basically said there was nothing he could do about it. No returns were possible so I was ripped off by the poor employee knowledge. If I would have just been helped out by an employee who knew something I wouldnâ€™t be having this issue. Walmart has lost my service as well as my families service as we will no longer be shopping there. :)"
401,46448,Michelle Lindsey,19/10/2019,Walmart,"Their site said I could pick up my order in Burbank After placing the order: Pick up was in Pico Rivera. :( So I called. The representative, cancelled my previous order, but she couldn't place the order for Burbank either. In fact, she didn't believe there is a store there! Hey WALMART PEOPLE: FYI You have a store in Burbank @ 1301 N Victory Pl, Burbank, CA 91502!!! Given the Rep was incapable of placing the order for pick up where I wanted; we decided on Duarte. Then I thought: ""Why should I have to drive to Duarte? Get me your manager."" She said the manager was on a long call. So, She wanted to transfer me to the support team. I said sure. Then the call was disconnected. After not receiving a call back; I placed the order for DUARTE."
402,46449,Make America Great,19/10/2019,Walmart,Worst store ever it took me 15 minutes to shop but bc theres only 2 or 3 registers open it took me 20 minutes to check out oh and lets not forget another 5 minutes for the guy at the door to check my receipt and make me feel like I'm some kind of criminal. I used to love this store but after this I'm going back to shoprite n target and I'm far from alone on this
403,44400,bree gibb,19/10/2020,Walmart,"I love Walmart but my experience with Walmart.com has been the worse. Orders dont get delivered, tracking is never accurate. It's been a huge headache. I was dumb enough to order a kitchen table with bench & chairs knowing they messed up all my orders in the past. Sure enough, the table comes no chairs or bench. It is only showing 1 package coming. Customer service tried telling me that the chairs will come separately but they could not provide tracking for the chairs for me. This has happened in the past where package was missing pieces and they said it was coming separately and it never came. So here I go again. Smh"
404,44401,G.B.,19/10/2020,Walmart,"Something Happened to the Service of the onine fulfillment and delivery. There were some items at the beginning of COVID that Walmart had that no other online order and delivery service offered.. These were some monthly items that were fulfilled quickly and accurately, at first. Then, somewhere in July or August the service fulfillment took a turn for the worse. Started with an Item that I specified the details about and they sent a similar item that I specified not to send as a replacement in case they were out. They sent the item I said not to replace with. I got onlinelchat, they apologized and sent a new one. I opened the box and presto, it was exactly the same incorrect item. I cancelled the order and went to the online service with the big 'A' and got what I wanted. The latest was my monthly order,that my e-mail said would be delivered the next day. It wasn't. I contaced support. They apologized as they are told to do and gave me a delivery time 48 hours later. They never said why it did not arrive. 48 hours later, the delivery never came. I contacted support, they apologized and told me the shipping label had been created but the shipment never loaded onto the deliver truck, They gave me 48 hours for it to arrive. 48 hours later it still did not arrive so I contacted support. They apologized. They told me that the shipment was 'LOST in TRANSPORT'. That's it. 'Lost in transport.' They tried to give me 48 hours delay. I said no, cancelled the order. I went to the online service with the big 'A' and found that they now had the product AND for $8 less and no minimum purchase for free shipping as I have a membership. So I have said farewell to Walmart and wonder if the shareholders and management are trying to lose business to that other mega Online company and wait until Walmart goes Belly up. At any rate. no more of my $$$ for Walmart. That other company will get virtually 100% of my money now. I offer no rote Apology Walmart as you require your agents to say. It is a meaningless gesture on your part anyway!"
405,44402,michelle Williams,19/10/2020,Walmart,Its pretty damn sad when a store can't maintain cashier manned registers. There were 3 normal lanes rest were do it yourself. Well i hate do it yourself lanes and given a chance I'd rather use a normal lane and I prefer a different store.
406,44403,Tom Berry,19/10/2020,Walmart,"Ordered a fridge from them and it arrived dented. I mailed it back to get a refund and have called them 5 times after failing to refund me. They continue to say they will call me back but never do. Each new agent says the same thing, call back in a few days. It has been escalated four times now. Worst help center experience of my life! It has been almost a month and a half. Walmart stole 110$ from me!"
407,44404,Whitney Gregory,19/10/2020,Walmart,"I go to Walmart very often. I get a little annoyed when I go in for a gallon of milk, with only cash, and I have to stand in line for 15 minutes waiting on the slowest cashiers. I'm not the complaining type, but I've had almost enough. Sunday afternoon, a hundred some people in the store, and two check outs open. That's not ok. Whenever anyone complains about it or asks, all we hear is that they don't have enough employees trained at the registers. You have 5 to 6 people in one area stocking shelves and the slowest workers at the check outs. Don't tell me you can train a few more people. It's not ok. I don't wanna hear that anymore. I don't say anything because I get it. You're low on employees due to CORONAVIRUS but that does not make it ok for it to take so long to get in and out of there. The people at the registers can always be polite and talk A Little, But there's a line. They do not have to talk and talk about every item they scan, and about everything under the sun. Especially when they see the huge line behind."
408,44405,Ben Nicole,19/10/2020,Walmart,DONE with Wal-Mart online!! Bought something through the marketplace which turned out to be old or fake. Tried to return in store and the app would not let the customer service member. I was there 45 minutes trying to return it with no luck. Chatted with two people who could not help me on the app. One of them disconnected without warning. So now Iâ€™m stuck with it. The app is GARBAGE! Wal-Mart should nix the marketplace. It is trashing your name... and find new people to do your app. It is God awful.
409,44406,ralph,19/10/2020,Walmart,"I'm done with Walmart . all Walmarts! All they sell is China crap! CHINA IS BUILDING THERE WAR MACHINES WITH OUR MONEY! Time to stop feeding Walmart our money! Plus ....... they never have enough cashiers.... they even want us, there customers. to self check out! We give them our money , and STILL HAVE TO CHECK OURS SELVES OUT? Come on folks , wise up I HAVE!!!"
410,44407,Kelly Sullivan,19/10/2020,Walmart,Kemptville walmart is thee worst . Custmer service could not get any worse. The price things wrong . And dont seem to think they need to honour it or even care. Shop at giant tiger or amazon . before going back there. Manfement is do RUDE..
411,44408,Gerry Gary,19/10/2020,Walmart,"There is a reason I still go to Amazon verses Walmart.  They tried to charge me a merchandise fee. They told me it was for hazardous materials and wastes they lied. A merchandise fee is charged when goods are exported and have to go through customs, considering my purchase was domestic this doesn't apply and no other company that I know of charges it.  They gave me a 15 dollars discount so that part ended up being good and I though wow that's is cool.  My shipment was supposed to be next day, however it didn't get here until three days later  All was good except for my bags of popcorn, one popped open and there was popcorn everywhere. The rest of the bags were smashed. They packed a 24 pack of sparkling water in the same box with no padding. Absolutely STUPID!  They may have been a few bucks cheaper with their skinny pop popcorn but I would gladly pay a tad bit higher to deal with Amazon in which I never had any shipment issues! or bogus charges.  Walmart has a long way to go in their experience both in store and online, they better wake up or they will fail."
412,44409,mikey dee,19/10/2020,Walmart,"walmart online is shiet! ordered 23rd of September, expected delivery date was 5th of october, coming up on the one month non delivery this week which will be a month. In the meantime ordered the same product on amazon and it took 2 days. Fuc. Walmart! They will be out of the online business soon."
413,42150,Donna Nall,19/10/2021,Walmart,"Pitiful. I ordered one item and received a â€œdeliveredâ€ email but I never received the item. Now, Iâ€™ve ordered a second item of garage shelves and only half the shelving was in the box. Of course, Walmart has replaced both but it is a terrible hassle to have to call Walmart and then wait for the replacement to get here. Donâ€™t know if problem is Walmart or fed-ex but Iâ€™m done with their online ordering."
414,42151,Robert Carr,19/10/2021,Walmart,Delivered damaged and having a terrible time getting a refund. No customer service number until you do a whole bunch of hurdles. now I have to deliver gun safe back to the store to get my refund. Delivered by truck and lift gate but I have to return by car.
415,42152,Venus,19/10/2021,Walmart,"Typically, Walmart does deliver items accurately but lately they have hired individuals to deliver goods and I have been cheated out of my items several times. The delivery person rings the door bell and if you do not answer they take a picture of your home address or door or garage door and then states they delivered the items. However, they take the items or never remove them from their cars. Today, I lost over 20 dollars with goods and I did make a formal complaint against the non-regulated delivery person with Walmart but they basically told me to wait 48 hours and then complain again. Private or 3rd party delivery service or person, is a complete failure and is ripe with fraud."
416,42153,Brenda Milner,19/10/2021,Walmart,"WALMART the new website is not functioning . You can no longer see the item you are selecting, it is all blurry, then when you want to see the details of item it closes back out to the main screen. Why would you put the item you wish to look at in a small little box and have it blurry unless you click on the eyeglass to bring it into focus. Why would you make it hard to view item details????? Its no longer enjoyable to look at potential items I may wish to buy, itâ€™s more of a labored chore, so I no longer browse items, definitely do no not like the new website, itâ€™s way more cumbersome to view items, really dissatisfied."
417,42154,Jordan McCarty,19/10/2021,Walmart,"Tries too hard to be discount Amazon. Listings are not only clogged up by resellers, but I can't even effectively browse what items are available at my local store and order them for pickup. When I tried to purchase an item I know they always have in stock it says it'll be 1 WEEK before I can pick it up because they're appointments are all booked. Who has every heard of needing an appointment for what should be a 30 second exchange? I can't even check if it is somehow out of stock. It really feels like the site has just completely forgotten that Walmart has physical locations everywhere and instead tries to copy-paste Amazon's model."
418,42155,Doug,19/10/2021,Walmart,I can't even navigate to the place where i can pick up a item in my in basket at my local store.  this is absolutely the worst site i have ever attempted to use not even one star.
419,42156,Haleh Amini,19/10/2021,Walmart,The most horrible experience I've ever had with online shopping. -They send fake emails that you have received your item; -they do not hold their vendors accountable for the sales and let them manipulate customers however they want; -their customer service cannot refund your money even though you have not received your item and they will only send useless emails to dishonest vendors; - and be aware of very cheap qualities that are not like anything being described online.
420,47324,Mike,20/10/2014,Walmart,I ordered a HP-15 laptop on a Monday on a close-out special. I received it on Wednesday. Quick turnaround. $299 for a killer laptop delivered in 2 days!
421,46443,l ke,20/10/2019,Walmart,"While I am the 1st to point out bad things in all my reviews, I must admit that as a disabled & homebound person that I USUALLY get my packages, at least the same week sometimes, fully realizing that I may NEVER get some of them. I am certain that in my medical condition I will NEVER be able to go in person to deal with the horrible ""customer service"" lines that are just there to discourage returns. I propose this holiday season to be sure & get a shipping return label for any item purchased in the store or online & make USPS come pick up the package to get your refunds from Walmart. Our USPS carrier, Cindy, zip 80219, has stolen our packages for over 10 years, been declared performing illegal activities by the USPS Office of Inspector General, but STILL has their permission to continue to steal & no termination in site. I ALWAYS make sure ANY site I buy from is aware of this. Usually the seller on W.com will send it another way even if I pay extra just to actually get it or I go directly to their website instead of using W.com. Amazon.com refuses to stop using USPS after a decade of me filing claims for stolen packages, so bye bye A.com! I would like to point out here that A.com will NOT let you post a low review- so do it here at Trustpilot! And if you haven't ever heard of it, do the holiday boycott on using Amazon.com. "" Amazon faces boycott ahead of holidays as public discontent,"" google the guardian as Trustpilot doesn't allow links."
422,46444,Michael Maylone,20/10/2019,Walmart,I do not recommend anyone to purchase an air mattress from Walmart I purchased the air mattress when we air it up it didn't work I went right back the same day to exchange it customer service was closed and I had to purchase another one when I did return it they said they can't return only exchange okay the problem is their product they don't have anymore nowhere in any Walmart I had to exchange it for a one that's a little higher price I had to pay the difference and I really didn't need the mattress this is to me is stealing because they took my money and did not give me the goods that was supposed to be when I try to make it good had to pay more I'm going to report it to the better business bureau and I'm going to put it on Facebook on their website and the state of Iowa and the whole country needs to make laws for companies like this that can't take advantage of people when they're trying to purchase something that's why I usually buy stuff off of eBay because this would have happened because if anything you get is not as they described their give you a full refund and return packaging
423,46445,Maureen,20/10/2019,Walmart,"I live in an area in northern California that pge and ATT shut down all power and phone lines...I went Walmart in Placerville to buy a cell phone...I couldn't activate it at home as I didn't have power so I asked Dan Ramey, Sales Manager at the Walmart if he would help me...he saw the desperation in me....he quickly got the phone out of the box, called the phone service and immediately got my phone activated and working...I was so relieved that I was able to have contact with family and friends during this time. I was so grateful for Dan Ramey to help me in this situation....Dan Ramey is a wonderful asset to the Walmart corporation and he was my hero that day!  Maureen"
424,44394,Michael Aycock,20/10/2020,Walmart,"Walmart in San Leandro people are lazy and poor customer service. Very rude and cannot help someone who is disabled locate items. They run me from m one end to the other, still didnâ€™t find what I was looking for. I will do my best to encourage a boycott unless they improve. THEY DID NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. After I left Walmart, I went to target, and the associate there took me right to the item I was looking for. Kudos for Target."
425,44395,Brian Heise,20/10/2020,Walmart,"I compared grocery store compliance with mask wearing ie COMPLETELY COVERING FACE AND NOSE at 4 Baton rouge grocery stores. I observed directly and made eye contact with 25 empluees at all stores ( approx).  1 walmart highland and lee 65% 2 whole foods same town 96% 3 costco 90% 4 calvins 85%  I directly made eye contact with and observed on 10 19 20 about 25 employees ( all 4 stores)  At whole foods the manager said he would imediately correct the issues as they arise. At calvins "" we try but we cant easily terminate people. Costco apparently gives three warnings.  I never had a problem firing employees. When i had enough, i said "" your fired - get out now and dont come back. Never had a problem telling people that they are a failure or whatever.  Additionally im finding now walmart competative prices on bread and milk at whole foods  So im gonna play this with some caution but now i think with whole foods preservative free foods and store brand prices, shopping here is a win win deal.  Im gonna keep a close eye on all of their employees though and try to get anyone fired ie without complete face covering  I encourage everyone to try persuade others to wear masks always and correctly. I feel we as americans have a patriotic duty to sanction ie punish noncompliance with public health standards. This is not a time for trying to do anything ie mask slipped or im anxious about breathing or whatever. People who ' try' are failures and should just be ignored and rejected."
426,44396,Jamie Spencer,20/10/2020,Walmart,Not only do they owe me money for a pair of rain boots that I bought for my grandson and never received. But they also charged me $28 for shipping on a $145 order when their website says orders over $35 are free! I will never shop Walmart again their stores or online! I've technically and literally been ripped off for over $60 in the last few months.
427,44397,Charles,20/10/2020,Walmart,3rd party vendor canceled half my order without notifying me. No phone support. Help chat was with someone from India who disappeared and never responded.
428,44398,Nancy Cieslak,20/10/2020,Walmart,There kind of good they dont treat there workers how there supposed to be treated but they also need to keep up with there supplies
429,44399,Tenzin Lhaze,20/10/2020,Walmart,I just had a poor experienceâ€” canâ€™t believe that the personnel charged me for another customer and then went on to argue that I had asked to combine the order together!! Why would I do that??? I understand human errors happen but try to be apologetic and be understanding rather than pointing fingers when it was the personnelâ€™s error while wasting my time too. Such a poor service!!!
430,36174,PhilipALight,20/10/2018,Amazon Go,"Good food, great value, super fast Still not sure how this works but what a fantastic concept!! I picked things up, put things down (sometimes in different places) and it just knew exactly what was going on. Such a clever concept!! Really enjoyed the experience and the prices are good too so you wonâ€™t pay over the odds. You need to download the free Amazon Go app and log in with your Amazon account in order to enter. You wonâ€™t be here for ages so not worth making a special journey (unless you are super interested in tech or a bit geeky) but it can be visited on route to somewhere else and is a lot of fun!!"
431,36365,Seahawk A.,20/10/2019,Amazon Go,I came into this store not knowing what to expect. I was very surprised at how easy it was to shop in. I didn't find anything I wanted outside of a candy bar and a coffee mug. For the people that live in the area it's perfect. It will be great when they get the kinks ironed out and sell more then coffee and sandwiches.
432,42145,Tina Marie,20/10/2021,Walmart,"I put in order for a cake pan , They shipped it to wrong address, I am a baker and needed it for a birthday cake. They are doing nothing and told me i could talk to thier legal team but only gave me a physical address and not a phone number. I will never shop at walmart in-store or online again! I had to give a 1 star for review but please make that a negative number. This was for a 3 yr old's birthday cake."
433,42146,Ross Fasolino,20/10/2021,Walmart,"Walmart, the anti-veteran, anti-military, anti-American, China loving retailer. Sam would be sooo proud of his descendantsâ€¦. NOT."
434,42147,Raven,20/10/2021,Walmart,"I really wanted to like Walmart+. I started off for two reasons. First, they had a two week free trial, which they added a bonus two week free trial to, just for answering a couple of questions. Second, I was ill and needed to not have to leave the house for an undetermined amount of time, likely a few weeks. The first delivery didn't go well. I'm disabled, checked the box for me to sign for groceries, expecting them to knock at the door and dry them right inside. None of that happened. She set my groceries down, knocked and ran. I had ordered a case of water. I had to sit on the ground and slide my groceries in. The second one they cancelled for no reason given and third one arrived an hour past the last hour due. The fourth one was due here between six and seven p.m. at seven I received a message that it was running late. At eight I received a message that they'd shopped my groceries and substituted one item. It's now almost eleven p.m., closing time and I haven't heard any more. I've called, but that department is closed, customer service is closed, the managers are supposedly all gone for the day and no one knows a thing. I'm cancelling this ""plus"" membership"". I can only assume the plus stands for plus more headaches."
435,42148,Arick,20/10/2021,Walmart,Item was never sent and they refused to complete the exchange lied and said fedex lost rose but fedex says never received. Never shop here the customer service is worse than terrible
436,47255,Jaime Arnold,21/10/2016,Walmart,"I do not recommend anyone to shop online with walmart. If you need anything, go straight and get your things."

438,46441,Babak MLE,21/10/2019,Walmart,"Never buy anything from the; because you will soon regret it! Their online store is peace of s**t, as you wont get your order! Very irresponsible customer support team who are easily saying we're sorry; but they obviously don't mean it! I didn't receive my orders while they had it on their stock!"
439,46442,Ashley Ferreira,21/10/2019,Walmart,I bought a shelf for my sons room online. It was supost to be brand new and it comes with scratches all over edges and they touched it up with a total different color of grey it's almost a black. I'm about to have a baby next week and had to pay someone to build it as well as to bring back to walmart now. So a total waist of money. If I wanted some used looking furniture I would of went to a garage sale.
440,44392,Navyguy,21/10/2020,Walmart,"I tried to return an unopened multirole package of toilet paper six hours after I bought it and Walmart refused to take it back. The reason they gave was the ""Department was not ready to accept returns at this time"" whatever that means. They were completely unable to even speculate on a date that a return might be possible. Supposedly, this policy was to reduce traffic in their stores for high demand items like various paper products several months ago, These are fairly readily available today. I read their policy and they are accepting returns in 41 states but not Illinois. This is a ridiculous policy. I will STOP shopping at Walmart and encourage others to do the same."
441,44393,Greg,21/10/2020,Walmart,"I wish, I can rate them at zero. Order Ink Jet cartridges. After 2 days received wrong one. Called the same day customer service about the wrong cartridges. Called 3 more times. Now is almost 3 weeks, no money return or new cartridges"
442,42141,Matthew Barnes,21/10/2021,Walmart,The new application update with shipping added is absolutely horrible. It is the most horrible update I have seen in a grocery app. I will now be using other delivery forms of groceries from other companies. Fire the person who wrote this program.
443,42142,Lori Alanis,21/10/2021,Walmart,"its stupid that they combined shipping and pickup items, makes everything harder"
444,42143,Kurry Kabob,21/10/2021,Walmart,"Do not ever order anything from Walmart.com - customer service and returns are non existent! I was given a baby shower gift that was purchased from Walmart.com. When I went to Walmart to return for store credit because I received 2 of the same item I was told they would need to refund the gift giver and I would need to work it out with the friend who gave me the gift. This is hands down awful, makes no sense and is insulting the the gift giver.  It's amazing how Amazon, Target and all other major retailers have figured out a way to work with 3rd parties and issue refunds but these folks haven't. The can't seem to grasp a basic concept of I purchased it from your store therefore your store should provide a refund and customer service. Their 3rd party problems should not be made my issue.  Walmart YOU SUCK"
445,42144,Litty Lights,21/10/2021,Walmart,"Not even worth one star. On previous versions of the app, (the older Walmart app), it was user friendly and had a good layout. The new update made things more confusing than ever, and the price scanner is not accurate. Many items you scan in store will come up as ""item not found"", ""item coming soon"", or ""we no longer sell this item"", when the item(s) are fully in stock and right in front of you in store. If the scanner does pull up a price, often times it shows the price of that item online for shipping to your current store instead of the price of the item in your current store. Many people including myself enjoyed using the older version of the Walmart app and now we are forced to download the update in order to use the app. I don't think people should be forced to update if they don't want to. The new app should have been majorly tested before even being released for public use."
446,42942,Mike,21/10/2021,Walmart,"Forget everything else but the fact that this company trains its employees critical race theory, etc., anti white... Done with them"
447,46438,Shana,22/10/2019,Walmart,Shopping online for electronics and making a purchase adding the protection plan doesnâ€™t help you when you need a replacement. They send you here there and everywhere.
448,46439,Gretchen Tate,22/10/2019,Walmart,"I bought a Straight Talk phone. 5 months later I decided to make it a Safelink phone. After wasting my time, I was rold my phone wasn't compatible and to take it back to Wal-Mart. I took the phone and the receipt and got blown off. I had 15 days to return the phone, they wouldn't do an even exchange. Wal-Mart keeps blowing me off and saying to speak to Tracfone and Safelink, and when I said I had, they keep saying the same thing. So now I have a phone I can't use, 3 companies givimg me the runaround, and lots of VERY BAD SERVICE FROM WALMART. They don't care."
449,44388,c gavin,22/10/2020,Walmart,******BUYER BEWARE*********Walmart advertises they have hard to find items like alcohol to bait you into purchasing other things online when they have no such items available. They even send emails that says the hard to find item has shipped. When your package arrives you will find everything but the hard to find item but now they've gotten your business. Reporting them to Better Business Bureau
450,44389,Sandy Forrester,22/10/2020,Walmart,"I'm not doing Trick or Treat this year because of the virus, but yesterday I decided to prepare treat bags for a few special people (young and old.) It was pretty late because I would need one of the bags 5 days before Halloween. So I went to the Walmart site and searched for 2-day delivery items. Luckily, I found quite a few same-day delivery, but at least one was 2-day. No problem, still plenty of time. I placed the order in the wee hours this morning, and was so surprised when my order (all of it) arrived before noon. Incredible! Thanks so much, Walmart. You are fantastic!"
451,44390,ED. C,22/10/2020,Walmart,"normally I don't write reviews but so fed up with walmarts online help. had ordered face masks by Apeak in Aug 6/2020.should of came the latest Aug 18. Third party in China. that was I guess my first mistake. Now it is Oct 22. phoned 3 times to customer service and all said will f/u in 1 day,NOT! tried to get third party and doesn't seem to exist. talked to supervisor 3rd time and she was RUDE! hoping to get refunded but still not sure. A lesson to anyone reading this as not to order from walmarts third party sellers as they are not true to purchases or forever to get. Hope Miss Rude will refund my money. Note I was calm in asking and talking to this supervisor. Will not be buying products again online. Thanks Walmart! Not the way to keep customers"
452,44391,Cindy Walker,22/10/2020,Walmart,"RETURNING A PRODUCT CAN BE BRUTAL. ITS AN EASY PROCESS TO ORDER BUT NOT TO RETURN. I AM STILL TRYING TO GET MY MONEY BACK ON A PURCHASE MONTHS AGO. IT WAS VERIFIED RECEIVED BY FEDEX AND AFTER MANY CALLS PROMISING A REFUND, NOTHING. NEVER AGAIN."
453,36237,Rebecca K.,22/10/2020,Amazon Go,"Limited selection, but what they have they do well. They are targeted at being a grab and go lunch spot for Amazon employees so most of what they sell is pre-made lunches. It's convenient, but subpar for people with food allergies. I haven't seen this location have lines in years.  My mom picked up a sandwich here that she enjoyed. I used to love the shrimp and grits Amazon meal, but this location never had it in stock (only the larger Cap Hill one did and they seem to have discontinued it). A lot of their premade foods have nuts, so I couldn't try them.  The salads seem nice but are priced highly. Granted, Whole Foods salads cost even more and I've found flies in mine. If you want a lunch salad go anywhere else.  They have a large drinks section, but they are split into 2 parts of the store. Due to Covid the store is 1-way  wandering and I didn't notice the cheeped drinks are at the end and the beginning ones are more expensive.  The candy section was disappointing. They chose healthier brands. Skip the sour gummy worms. Honestly you can find everything here and have more selection at the Target a few blocks away. The main benefit here is no line, and the food is more grab-and-go."
454,42135,Tinnermom,22/10/2021,Walmart,This is happened to me a few times and if you read the fine detail you will notice they slip this in a little tricky in their writing on the website. I order quite a few items and have a large bill. As soon as I hit submit payment for my shopping cart I go into my bank app and it shows that Walmart is withdrawing my entire bill. What I donâ€™t know is really there making sure I have that amount in my bank but they are not actually pulling that money until each item ships and each item is charged separately depending on who itâ€™s being shipped from. Letâ€™s say five items shipped from five different places so you will get five different charges on different days. So because the bank thinks Walmart is taking this large fee they take it right out of your account and you see your balance showing that Walmart bill is paid. Itâ€™s a little bit of brain twist letâ€™s say. Really Walmart did not take that money after I looked at my account following my purchase. My bank still shows me they took that money but really when Iâ€™m not looking all that money is going back into my account because Walmart didnâ€™t really take it. They only take the money when your product is shipped. That is messing with my bank account really messed up!!!! I think the purchase came out because I seen it come out right after I made it but then when Iâ€™m not looking that whole transaction disappears and Iâ€™m looking at my balance in my bank thinking I have all this money that I donâ€™t have because now all of a sudden these things are going to start shipping and the money is coming back out of my account separately for each item. I am a mother who lives paycheck to paycheck so I really hate this because it has screwed me so hard not paying attention or understanding what Walmarts really doing. I certainly donâ€™t try to get overdrafts on purpose but making a large purchase with a debit card from Walmart can be really a brain screw when it comes time to taking payment. Here I thought my bill was taken care of in my balance in my bank was true and Walmart had it all twisted. They need to label that a lot better and explain it a lot better on their website.
455,42136,Jenna,22/10/2021,Walmart,"Absolutly horrible changes with this app/website features. I've been trying to order items for my kids for x-mas. I can't! 45 minutes wasted fighting with this. The screen only allows you to view the cart on the side of the screen and then flashes away. I want to see my full cart, shipping, pick up options.Not view them where I can't see them. I've already had to change my password from these changes. Then it didn't want to stay logged in and after 45 minutes of fighting with this and seeing the shipping fees that now make the savings, I would've got here actually cost more than Amazon and other stores compared to paying the normal price I'm done. This is one of the worst updates ever I've seen from a company. For anyone actually wanting to do business at Walmart..don't bother with this online nightmare. I used to enjoy Target and then they went to crap and items weren't appealing anymore, so I switched to liking Walmart because things were in stock but the website and shopping online is now impossible. Which means you're losing business, frustrating customers and don't actually care about what consumers want. Whoever designed the coding for this app needs better training and you need a better market research team because clearly the ones who you have now are not qualified and the roll out of this is terrible for your company especially before a holiday when items are already limited with a pandemic. So, disappointed. Market research is important and NO ONE WANTS A BROKEN WEBSITE and this hassle when shopping online."

457,42138,AbominableScotsman,22/10/2021,Walmart,"While shopping for groceries and other basic items, it's impossible to tell if an item has actually been added to your cart. An error on a single item will cause all other items in the cart to become ""Out of stock."" Incredible. When you go back to the page to re-add the item, you will be greeted by a grayed-out ""Add to cart"" button, until you refresh the page & it's suddenly back in stock. The cart is the ONE thing that should function. Who is testing this website?  Also, some items are listed as Pickup OR Delivery, but when they're added to the cart, Pickup becomes the only option. Try to change it and you have Pickup or Delivery from Store, shipping is not available. Items I've had shipped before are now pickup only because of this broken design.  There are also far too many random 3rd-party retailers, so each search page becomes cluttered with spam. Overall, shopping the site is just an awful experience, especially compared to all the other online retailers that get basic functionality right."
458,42139,Nora,22/10/2021,Walmart,Absolutely THE worse online shipping customer care. They lost my shipment then refund me then reorder supposedly a priority shipment then they donâ€™t show up during the delivery date and itâ€™s now set to arrive even later.

460,46436,Susan Gonzalez Bray,23/10/2019,Walmart,"Good evening. I wanted to let you know about a troubling experience I had the last two days at a WalMart Auto Center in Warner Robins, Georgia at 2720 Watson Blvd. This is store #01367. I came in with my son on 10/22/19 to purchase two tires. We instructed the technician to replace the front driver's side tire and to place a new tire on the front driver's side. We asked for the passenger side front tire to be rotated to the back of the passenger side. This was to ensure that my son would have two new tires on the front of his car.  First, I was informed by the technician that to move one tire from the front to the back would constitute a tire rotation and would cost $48.00. This seemed excessive, but I agreed. Next, when we returned to pick up the car, we found that our instructions had not been followed. We were told that moving our original front passenger tire to the back was against store policy even though the Walmart site clearly indicates that a single tire can be moved from one location to another for a mere $2.50, not the $48 I was charged. Then, we were informed that the technicians discarded our perfectly good front passenger tire and replaced it with a new tire. This was not what was requested. However, in doing so, they failed to replace the tire I actually wanted, the rear passenger tire which was very thin on tread. By the time we realized this, I had already paid for two tires, a tire rotation, and an oil change. The auto center was closing and we resolved to return the next day. Upon returning today, the on-duty manager whose name was Brent or Brant told my husband that despite the fact that their employees made a mistake, we would just have to buy a third tire. He offered a trivial $24.00 off the price of the tire, but said he had no more of the desired tire in stock and that he could sell us a more expensive tire. He said he would call us on Friday, two days from today when the new tire was in stock. He made no attempt rectify the price of the tire rotation, which is obviously not the service I requested.  Additionally, my son, whose vehicle it was, never signed for any transaction. However, a signature that was a mere squiggly line was shown on the order. Obviously, he did not consent to the changes they made.  So, at this point, my son still has an inadequate tire that has yet to be replaced. I am hesitant to wait for Friday. This auto center has lost all credibility with me. I have no faith that the tire will be in stock, that we will receive a call, or that the desired service will be completed with any fidelity.  In short, we are done with this Walmart. There are too many service options in our area to persist in visiting a retailer who I do not trust, especially when it comes to something as important as a tire. When I buy a tire for my college-age son, his life is in the hands of those who perform this service work. I feel as though we were manipulated, deceived, and cheated."
461,46437,Lou DeToma,23/10/2019,Walmart,"I shop Walmart store # 02140 nearly everyday. I am happy to report that two of your employees went above and beyond to assist me. Your employee Vicki, who works in the vitamins section, not only gave me directions, she walked with me all the way to the back of the store and found the kind of brush I needed. She had helped me in the past before.  Your second employee, Robert, who works the section opposite the meat Dept. and near the coffee aisle was most helpful. He was stocking his shelves when I told him that a store brand tropical trail mix had been out of stock for a few says. He stopped stocking and walked me back to the trail mix aisle.He found the spot where my trail mix was supposed to be. He scanned the shelf tag and told me he would order a shipment today. He explained that it might be a couple of days. I thanked him. Both Vicki & Robert did all this with a smile while thanking me for shopping Walmart.  I would ask that you recognize them both. People like them is why I shop Walmart.  My two REF #'s are: 929500143800 - ( Vicki ) & 929500737614 ( Robert ) Thank you  Respectfully,  Lou"
462,44379,Greg McDaniels,23/10/2020,Walmart,"This week, I used Walmart Delivery for the 1st time and it will be my last. I was injured, so I'm unable to go to my local store. I rarely go there anyway, due to how poorly run it is and how the staff is too interested with what is on the phones, than maintaining the store, but that's an entirely different story. Anyway, I selected the items that I needed from that stores inventory. All items were in stock, so I added the 15 items to my cart, paid and got the delivery date ( Friday 10/23/20). All seemed pretty painless. Then I get an email, letting me know that my order was being sent to me in 3 different packages. Seemed odd, since the store was like 5 miles away and all the items were in stock, but whatever. I then received an email, stating that the delivery dates were going to be on 10/21/20, 10/22/20and 10/23/20. Ok, still nothing to get upset about. The package to be delivered on the 21st, was coming from the local store, the 2nd one was coming from a store about 40 minutes away and the 3rd from another state. I get an email on the morning of the 21st, letting me know that my local package was ""out for delivery"" and to expect it by ""end of day"". Well, the end of day came and went and the order status was changed to ""Delayed"". The end of day on the 22nd came and went...no status change....about 5pm on the 23rd, still no package and still just the ""Delayed"" status, so I contacted customer service, to see about an updated status for that local package. After a bit of a wait, she comes back to let me know that the package got lost in delivery ( yes, they somehow lost my package, in the 10 minute drive from the store to my house). Results: I had to cancel 1 package that contained over 1/2 my order( and now 2 of the items are ""out of stock"") and at the time of writing this, I'm still waiting on the other 2 packages. I tried to give it a shot, but I'm sticking with Amazon."

Recieved call on 3rd night told customer service rep damage was already done and I will never buy another big ticket item from Walmart. Their customer service and support is horrendous.

I ordered online BioKleen laundry detergent. All went well, one week delivery (fine), charging me (fine). Five minutes later my order was cancelled due to...the popularity of the item. Why not update your website? or provide a date of future availability? Cancelling within minutes of taking my money and promising delivery is neither professional nor ethical.

470,36229,Lisa W.,23/10/2018,Amazon Go,"The future is now. Amazon go is such a neat concept. A convenient store where you can leave your wallet at home while you shop and check out without any human interaction.  Fist you need to download the Amazon Go app and set it up. It's setup from your Amazon account and linked credit card. As you walk into the store you swipe in with your phone and the provided scan key from the app. You can check a nonmember in under your account as well. As you pick items off the shelf they are added to your virtual cart. If you put the item back, it is taken out of the cart. When you are finished you just walk out if the store. All payment and processing are done via your amazon account and app. Shortly after you will receive a text showing your receipt.. even the amount of time you spent in the store. Easy peasy!  The store contains items you'd find in stop and go store. Food, drinks, snacks, prepared meals and house hold type items. The only human interaction I spotted was near the alcohol corner. I assume she checks that you're legal to toss a bottle of wine or two in the bag    The hole process was super easy. I'm sure we will see more of these store pop up around us soon."

474,42132,Carolyn in Venice FL,23/10/2021,Walmart,"I bragged about Walmart's grocery website to Publix and now they have a new update that is really terrible. The update is difficult to navigate. You constantly have to reenter that you want only items that you can pick up in the store, I can't find a sort to only pull up in stock items so I have to go through all of the out-of-stock which are many. I'm not interested in shipped items for a weekly grocery order. Walmart, please change this as many people I know are also complaining and I didn't bring up the topic."

Even though I understand her frustration she shouldnâ€™t have followed us. We donâ€™t appreciate the way the handled the situation, she just wanted to blame us."

479,46432,Anita Janae Lepire,24/10/2019,Walmart,"Two months ago an Onn tablet was purchased at Walmart. Onn tablets are a Walmart product. A couple of weeks ago the battery stopped charging; and when it's plugged into the charger it say's it's overheating. Went back to the Walmart it was purchased at in Fredericksburg, VA, Central Park Shopping Center to return it. I was literally standing right in front of the sign, at customer service, that states that Walmart is happy to give a refund or exchange on any purchase with or without a receipt for 90 days. Guess what; this was 60 days and they would NOT take it back. I was told that on this tablet it's only a 15 day return policy, even if the darn thing stops working and the claim it has a year warranty. All we wanted was a store credit to purchase another brand of tablet. This should be very easy for them, since all they have to do is send the returned back to Onn as defective. Now they've lost a more lucrative sale and a whole family of customers!  I already knew that Walmart does price gouging on some necessary items--(such as baby needs), and some times of the year--such as during a snowstorm. Now I realize, however, that they are Blatantly dishonest in Everything and can not be trusted for any purchases at all."
480,46433,Joseph Driskell,24/10/2019,Walmart,I order stuff on here when Amazon is out and they are ALWAYS damaged. If you are ordering from here order 2x what you actually need because half of it will be damaged.

All three vendors, Always Deal, Wombat and Certified Refurbished shipped a Mac Book Air with a 9â€ screen. Amazing! One vendor said, we donâ€™t sell 9â€ Mac screens. Is there something very wrong with this picture? Is this a matter of coincidence? No probably not. I needed a better computer to finish my important history project. One month later, no Mac Book. I had to cover $1200. on my credit card plus fees. I am vet on a fixed income. Could these Walmart vendors be running a scam by shipping out old stock, not a great seller 9â€ minicomputer when I clearly ordered a 11.6â€ screen? Did they purposely ship 9â€ screens because not everyone will return them? So, there is a chance to make more money? Please let me know if this happened to you. Could there be a class action law suit here? I tried to contact Walmart Corporate. Their 800 number didn't work. Yesterday, after nearly one hour on the phone no one from Walmart Corporate could tell me who was in charge of their vendor program. So, the 9â€ screens could still be sailing around the world? Why do we have to be treated this way? Victorsan"
497,46429,Steve,25/10/2019,Walmart,"Ordered and paid for item. While waiting for it to arrive, I noticed that the price for item had almost doubled since ordered. Received email from seller that item had mysteriously been returned to them and they advised me to accept a refund, this may happen again. I told them no I wanted item and to ship. I then received email saying that item had been delivered. I never received anything. Email showed different town . Surprise, surprise . Contacted seller and offered full refund. Again, no I want item. Four more emails back and forth with seller , which yelled nothing and four to Walmart that were a waste of time, I finally gave up. All this shows that Walmart doesnâ€™t honor what they put on Walmart.com andthey have no control over there sellers . The sell was walfront item was listed for$28.49.

Now I called totally 9 times regarding my money back .for the past one and a half month Iam asking them to return my money,when ever I ask them they says it will be credited to your account within 4 working day,how ever I lost my money , here after I never recommend any one to order online from Walmart .."

504,44374,BD,25/10/2020,Walmart,"10/24/20, 3-4ish pm. Store #00576 located at 207 S Memorial Dr, Tulsa, Ok...manager ""Seth"", store employee ""Josh"", a person that stands around at the entrances inside, talking to other employees & not paying any attention to customers entering the store, nor their needs. I just cant figure out what in the world his job might be other than, as previously said, talk, laugh with other employees at the inside entrances & totally ignore customers as they come in. What is the job of these individuals hanging around the inside entrances anyway?....well based on my experiences & observations...their jobs must be to catch up on the latest activities of each other & social media. There's one guy, his name is Josh, that hangs around the front doors that refuses to wear his mask properly. When I asked him why not, his answer was because he's not sick...& when discussed further about the rising numbers of people getting sick & dieing, he shrugged & said, oh well it's not his problem & he doesnt care. WHAT?!!!! In this day when Ok has almost $1,200 new CoVid-19 cases, PER DAY, we have this defiant, uncaring, inconsiderate person that doesnt care whether he might be spreading CoVid-19 to any of the customers that come through Walmart's doors. I was horrified & disgusted at the cavalier attitude...it's people like Josh that are helping to put so many people in the hospital & to those that may die. Yes, I asked to speak to the store manager...which was Seth that came to speak to me. I explained my concerns about Josh's defiant & uncaring attitude & about Walmart's laid back attitude on CoVid-19. Seth said he would talk to Josh. Within the next 30-40 minutes, in the course of my shopping, I went by the front door area several times, where Josh was working (& I use that word loosely) & I would see Josh still not wearing his mask properly. I talked to Seth, the manager, several times about Josh & he would tell me he hadn't talked to Josh yet...Why not? This is about public health! Instead Josh continued to hang out & talk to his fellow employees & the customers as a potential covid spreader. Walmart used to have simple & to the point signs around the outside entrances telling people to wear masks when shopping. In fact, they used to have someone standing outside the entrances stopping people that were not wearing masks & offering one to them. Now they do still have a few signs but they are very unassuming & wordy to the extent that no customer is going to stop from going in to try to find these essential signs, much less to take 5 minutes to stand there, look for them & to read them. I'm guessing the financial bottom line, became more important than public health. Really? Walmart is such a pillar of the community...they should be examples to those that shop there....to the community...to be leaders in our fight against CoVid-19. Come on Walmart!...stand up & be counted as one of the good guys! & enforce your mask policy (especially within your own ranks of employees) & if the employee blatantly refuses to care about representing Walmart properly or has such an uncaring attitude about customers, they need to move along & let someone else that really needs a job & will be a team Walmart player have a chance. I am extremely stressed & irritated at the thought of shopping at this store again!"
505,44375,ldstap,25/10/2020,Walmart,"I just heard an ad on TV that you can order and get your delivery free. That is not true! If you order select products and $35.00 worth, you will get those products with no delivery charge. But many products don't qualify for this. False advertising big time!"
506,44376,Chelsea Asher,25/10/2020,Walmart,I was verbally abused by someone in the parking lot and then I come in even though the money center is not supposed to close until 8 I got there at 7:15 and they told me I'm sorry we closed early today without any notice warning nothing so I wasted time gas energy and money and then when I asked for a manager and I try to explain to her what's going on she catches an attitude it says you don't have to yell in my face when I was 5 feet away from her and trust me I'm the type of person if I yell the whole store would know. I think it's extremely unprofessional of Walmart to say that they offer service until a certain time but when someone tries to use the service that they offer they say oh we closed up early where's the customer service at?
507,36281,Owen R.,25/10/2018,Amazon Go,"I don't think I exaggerate when I say, this is one of the best, modern shopping advancements ever. It's only 6 stores in USA thus far, 3 in Seattle. It's the future of shopping.  It's on a smaller scale now, convenience store level. Although they have numerous prepared meals, etc available One day imagine not filling a grocery cart, emptying it to scan it, then bagging it. Grab what u want, scan and go. No more long, annoying grocery store, retail lines.  You get a notification with the detailed list of purchases and time spent in the store. This felt like an iPod/iPhone experience, total game changer.  Something new and exciting.  Only downside it will probably take decade(s) to reach beyond the current big cities (Seattle, has 3 Chicago has one and San Fran has one). Most important part of Seattle trip, this is the future, now please HURRY UP.  We need this in Toronto, Tacoma, Flint, maybe even Brampton!?  (Worst city in North America) ;)"

509,42119,Cathy Battle,25/10/2021,Walmart,I canceled my Walmart+. I paid upfront for 1 year and used it for more than 6 months. I called Walmart today and had them refund my money for the year and 2 transactions they put through without my permission. Walmart has messed up their system. I will not get anymore clubs or anything else from them. In this 6 months I have had fraud from them 8 times including from their employees. I am done with Walmart. Think twice before messing with Walmart. They just tried to charge me $16 for 2 tomatoes and 1 head of cabbage. That i NEVER ordered. It was just in my cart from shopping last night. Think twice !!!!
510,42120,Tom Wynn,25/10/2021,Walmart,"It is the real nightmare for me more than a month : When I canceled 2 window Air Conditioners @ Walmart online after I changed my mind . But for some reasons they still delivered to my house 4 window air conditioners on the next day, and they still charged to my account over to $ 750.000 As a result I been trying by returning back to Local Walmart stores ( more than 6 times with 5 different locations) but got no luck at all , I was not able to returning to any stores because without return labels from Online sending. I try to call them several times , and the customer service representatives keep saying that they will send me these Returning labels @ my email , but they never sent to me. I would never and ever will buy anything from Walmart online again , I am so disappointed them."
511,42121,Anisha,25/10/2021,Walmart,The long island locations are very bad. Not like the ones in the south. They have very little selection and very hard to find what iâ€™m looking for. Much better off going to target or ordering on amazon

513,46426,Judy Plonk Davis,26/10/2019,Walmart,"I recently made an order from Walmart.com. We use online shopping regularly from Amazon, Goodlife, EBay, and shops for photography equipment. I made an order from Walmart.com. Some of the items came immediately FedEx another item came US Postal. We ordered 5 of the same item, but only 2 were included. I kept going into my account and the order didn't show up, it noted, ""You have not made an order in 6 months."" I ended up going to the confirmation email, copying the order number there, and wading through the very not customer friendly customer service web site to send an email The reply was very quick, explained that the 3 missing items could be refunded or shipped and that I should let them know which I wanted. There were no instructions as to ""reply to this email, or click the attachment, or use the button"". I had to again copy the number associated with the response and start a new email string. I was really frustrated, it was a pain to navigate and given the choice of other online stores and Walmart.com, I will never use Walmart.com again if I can help it."
514,44356,Dorothea Busby,26/10/2020,Walmart,Back in February I bought a new battery well it's died on me twice and caused me to get points at work I went up there for exchange and was talked down to and that they didn't have mine in stock and tried to charge me a hundred dollars for a new one but gave another person that was his color got it for just the difference between the two of them and I don't think that was fairly taken care of and it was the same one as I had
515,44358,Sue,26/10/2020,Walmart,"Ordered an 8' table. Received a laptop table. Called to get replacement. Was told order for replacement was placed and would arrive by Nov 12, 2.5 weeks. Told to take wrong item to store for return. Then received an email saying replacement can't be shipped until wrong product returned and return cannot be made at store. Shipping label attached to email was incomprehensible. Needed table for Thanksgiving and ordered on Oct 12 so plenty of time. Now I have no idea as to whether or not I will have the items by the time I need it and it is all their mistake."
516,44359,Puneet Saha,26/10/2020,Walmart,"Walmart auto service - When asked them to fix my tire with patch, they put me last in the queue. Kept me waiting for 3 hours, and picked jobs from customers who came way after me but wanted to replace tire. Seems like they coerce customers to purchase tire. From the moment,I towed my car, they asked me to check if they have new tire to replace without even considering if they can patch the puncture."
517,44360,Sierra Smooth,26/10/2020,Walmart,"Multiple times our groceries have not arrived, and on two separate occasions, never came at all. This last time they held our money, did not send our me groceries (waited 3 additional days and they never came), then told me that I would not receive a refund until 5 days later and that I would need to re-order if I still wanted to order fulfilled. Unreliable."

519,44362,Kevin Ware,26/10/2020,Walmart,"This is to let everyone know. Walmart doesn't honor there roll back policy. I brought a car battery and five days later it was rolled backed,eleven dollars cheaper. Went back with my receipt, and was told the only way to get the difference was to bring the battery in the store by manager. Battery was in the car I drove to the store. Called cooperate and was told it's at managers discretion. Ask what if it was a 55"" T.V. and was told the same thing would apply. That's what I call False Advertising. At other stores if a item goes on sale ,all you have to do is bring in your receipt. Good thing it wasn't tires. No more of my money going to WALMART."
520,44363,Sara,26/10/2020,Walmart,Shopping at walmart.com is awful. Things are never what they seem and their csutomer service is awful.
521,44364,Regina,26/10/2020,Walmart,I ordered a Roku system in June of this year and it has stopped working. Because I didn't purchase an insurance plan they couldn't help me. It's been a few weeks past 3 months and that plan lasts 3 months.. It looks like if you don't purchase a plan they will send you anything. And I am out of $55! I will no longer order from Walmart.com. I quit going into the Walmart stores period! Customer service stinks and they never have checkout lines open!

523,44366,Barry A Berhow,26/10/2020,Walmart,"Placed order at 11:00 AM on Sunday for delivery between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm. At 6:15 pm, I contacted CSR via chat whom informed me that first driver canceled but second driver was enroute to pick up order.  Order status showed processing and did not show actual order shopped until after 7:00 PM.  Contacted CSR again via chat and was told my order was delayed and unable to provide an estimated time for delivery. I was told to wait or cancel order. I had to cancel order since too late in evening to wait any longer. Second CSR did not seem to care about the inconvenience I was caused by Walmart's inept service. I was told that the order was canceled and there was nothing more they could do. They ended the chat abruptly.  I am canceling my delivery service option tomorrow and posting as many negative experience comments via the Internet that I can so that others can be warned.  Walmart relies on Door Dash or PostMates to deliver their orders and I have found out most drivers will not deliver for Walmart since they do not receive tips most of the time."
524,36264,Thao N.,26/10/2018,Amazon Go,"If you're a tourist and is going to check out the Amazon Spheres, you might as well be super touristy and come here too to check out the buzz with this cashier-less grocery store. It's right next to the venue so this location does get busy. So far there's 6 with 3 being in Seattle, pretty cool concept.  Does this decrease the price of groceries by cutting off on labor to have cashier? I'm not sure since it probably cost more to hire engineers to create this concept and upkeep on technology, but it is way more convenient for consumers to grab and go without the hassle of waiting in line to check out your items.  There's a lot of packaged to-go lunches, a small wine/alcohol selection, and a few choices for other department. It has the basis of what you need, but not as large as if you were to go to a Safeway, but I see this technology being the future of grocery stores.  Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
525,46424,Kris Kline,27/10/2019,Walmart,"This has been bothering me for a little bit and today I finally have had enough..... I understand that all retail has theft. I feel it is very intrusive to have a Walmart employee stand around talking only to observe customers -( Which in my eyes is a form of Stereotyping). However now there's a person that stands at the door on the way out to check your receipts and finger through your bags and items to be sure that you've not stolen anything. This is done to every cart that has an item not bagged... Seriously, I bought a mailbox!!! That gave the gentleman at the door ""the right"" to go through my items.... No where is it posted that somebody will be going through your items upon exit Walmart!!!! Not only have I heard that Walmart treats their employees disgracefully there are now moving on to their customers... Shameful Walmart!"

I placed an order for cookware that didn't work so I started a return via my phone. It generated a barcode. I take the cookware back to a store to return and when the associate scans the barcode, it states the product was already returned. SO.... I stand at the service desk for half a hour while the associate called WM.COM. The wm.com rep assured the store associate the return was made and I should expect a refund so the store retained the merchandise. It's now been 18 days and NO ONE will assist me. They have stolen $107 and everyone states that it's a store level problem even though it was a WALMART.COM purchase. NIGHTMARE CENTRAL.

The computer arrived and was so slow I couldnâ€™t even open more than one window. Took a long time to get a hold of the third party vendor NETTRADEZ, who was very rude and unprofessional. They did accept my return it cost me $50 to ship back. Over 1 month has passed and no refund was issued. Any attempt to reach out has been rude responses and no answer to when I will actually receive my refund. Awful experience. They stole my money and laptop. Do not deal with these people."

And honestly, it's a great tourist attraction. On a recent trip to Seattle it was my favorite place I visited. Much more fun than the Space Needle or Pike Place or the other more traditional tourist spots.  You wouldn't think that this setup would need many staff members, but there are an awful lot of them standing around. Mostly just to answer questions, I think. The young man I talked to was extremely patient answering all of my many, many questions, and didn't get the least bit upset as I ran around trying to trick the system.  And I'm disappointed/happy to report that I wasn't successful. Despite numerous attempts to fake pick up/really pick up/fake put back/actually put back/put back in the wrong place, I checked out with exactly what was in my bag.  If you're in town, I highly recommend a visit!"

539,42114,Tryout Fortrial,28/10/2021,Walmart,"Walmart's customer service is great. When in doubt, they would assume that you (the customer) are right, and would resolve your concerns quickly. This especially contrasts with my Best Buy experience (although BB and Walmart are not really comparable, but I can at least say something about their customer service), where BB's customer service often lies to get you to stop contacting them (claiming that your issue is resolved or is actually a non-issue, only for you to find out that the issue still remains)."
540,42115,HK,28/10/2021,Walmart,Walmart employees fraudulently charged $150.00 in gift cards on my account. Walmart administrators are incompetent to offer assistance and are extremely difficult to contact. Usually it appears that Walmart is managed from overseas.

They do not have employees at the fabric area to help cut the fabric and it takes forever for them to come help cut the fabric you want. My aim is always defeated. In summery not a good place to buy fabrics when in a hurry, they also have a limited variety. NB I have tried about 5 locations and experienced the same situation."

You wear it well, that you like Kroger do not care one bit about anyone who walks thru your doors. In fact you'd prefer we'd all just leave our wallets at the door and get out quickly.

If you want to check it out you need to do a few things first!  1) Download the Amazon Go App 2) Log into your account 3) Choose your preferred payment.  Done!  Then it's you just scan the QR code, walk in, grab your items (they do offer bags, but pro-tip bring your own), then just.... walk out.  This spot in particular feels more like a cafÃ© then grocery shopping. More of a lunch spot or a quick snack, not a whole cart full of items. They will soon have wine and beer so maybe even pick something up before HH or dinner? Who knows.  It was definitely a fun and enjoyable experience!"

No any sorry was from this man. Is this Walmart a shopping store? No good space, no safety, big mess. Maybe, this the style of Walmart?"

After contacting Corequity directly, they said they already sent a replacement and would be giving me tracking info soon. Never heard from them. I would give 0 stars if I could! Based on my experience with this vendor, and based on other reviews, I think Walmart should reconsider working with this vendor. In fairness to Walmart, though, Walmart gave me my money back for all 3 orders with no problem.  Issue #2: I've received 2 email requests to write reviews about my order. I wrote the review, but I can't send it. How frustrating! I take the time to write the review, but it never goes through! Is it because it wasn't a good review??"
557,42107,Ed Applefield,29/10/2021,Walmart,"101 E. 165 Service RD, Mobile, AL 36606. 1. Some of store produce was rotten/mold, tomatoes. Other produce was old and should have been trashed. 2. Check out lines were 8-10 deep. 3. Cashier failed to spin the cart so I wasn't given 1 bag of items I had purchased. I called the store 5 times... I was disconnected and put on hold over 15 minutes only to be told I needed to come back to store to get my store credit for the items I didn't receive. Why should I have to drive 30 minutes for a mistake of Walmart? They obviously don't care about the customer only their money."
558,42108,Janet Groom,29/10/2021,Walmart,I do not like the way that the Walmart app is set up now. I have to constantly remember to hit â€œpick upâ€ for each item or I have to go back later and try it. I liked the app the way it was before
559,42109,Mel,29/10/2021,Walmart,"Please stop profiling customers. I have lived in Arkansas and California, and I have seen employees profile customers. Sadly, I have been profiled as well. Please stop following me around the store and stop standing beside me at the self-checkout. I donâ€™t see them following the white folks around the store! I have been a customer for over 15 years and I do not need to steal from you. Maybe I will give my hard-earned money to another company. Tonight I was profiled again by a Hispanic employee. I caught him looking over my shoulder at self-checkout. I asked him if he needed something and he said the machine was signaling that something was wrong. I told him I didnâ€™t signal for help and the machine didnâ€™t either. I was scanning my groceries without any issues and minding my own business. I was also in a rush because my diabetic mother was about to throw up! He kept standing there and watched my Mother and me scan all of our groceries!! What the hell? I should have asked for his manager, but I didnâ€™t. You all need to pay attention to the people who steal instead of harassing innocent people. Not all people of color steals! You have the laziest employees and the worse customer service, but I keep going back because the stores are always closer to my home. Please, learn to have some good morals and train your employees to have some morals as well. This is disgusting!"
560,42110,Jamie,29/10/2021,Walmart,I should have known better than to order something from Walmart. I would give Walmart a negative 100 review if possible. Ordered an item almost 1 month ago for a specific event and still is not here! I've spoken to customer service multiple times and got no where.
561,42111,Pcos,29/10/2021,Walmart,One star because I had to for a review. Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced! I ordered a cosmetic serum. Took forever and they sent the wrong one. Opened box up to be sure. IT IS WRONG AND A FRAUD! I already have the product they sent directly from the manufacturer. It looks nothing like this. Looked into the seller and theyâ€™re in CHINA. And people are using God know what on their faces! Spent a tremendous amount of time with customer service- to no avail! Go elsewhere if you can. I canâ€™t trust what they sell and service is AWFUL!!!!
562,46416,Michael Winker,30/10/2019,Walmart,If you buy from walmart always check receipt before leaving the cashier because if they charge you twice for example you would have to go back to that particular store for them to credit your account for there screw up! No wonder there reviews suck! If you by online then you have the favor in your hands.Company truly is terrible!!!!

566,36220,Cindy L.,30/10/2019,Amazon Go,"Fun experience to just walk into a store, put your pick in your bag and walk out.  Right now, it is still limited to little grocery items, can't wait for it to expand."
567,42098,Linda Cartwright,30/10/2021,Walmart,"I recently ordered a wheelchair ramp for my front door from Walmart.com. It turned out to be the wrong size so I had to return it. That's where the trouble began. I set up 3 different dates through customer service reps and no one ever came to pick-up my return on those scheduled dates. I finally had to inconvenience my son by asking him to take the ramp to the store to return it. I recently broke my leg and can't walk or drive so I couldn't take it to a store myself. That's why I wanted the item to be picked up. I can't believe how incompetent this company is. Not once, twice but three attempts failed. I say Walmart.com - 3 strikes and you're out. I will not be ordering anything from them again."
568,42099,Susan Foster,30/10/2021,Walmart,"I am writing to commend the pharmacy at Walmart, No. Dartmouth,MA. Both the pharmacists and technicians are professional and give excellent service.

570,42101,Casey,30/10/2021,Walmart,"I recently bought a Calvin Klein perfume, went to return it with a receipt. The guy at customer service said that wasnâ€™t the perfume that it was 18.99 I paid 34.99. He said my card wasnâ€™t registered when the receipt clearly said my card number. The lady went to check the item and said it wasnâ€™t the same one like girl I just bought this here yesterday. She gave me half of the money back on a gift card so not go to this Wal Mart 00934 and do not buy the perfume that they overcharged and would not accept again."
571,42102,Matthew Merrill,30/10/2021,Walmart,"I did not think that I would be writing this review about Wal-Mart.  I ran into the Wal-Mart ( #5324 - 5260 W 7th street) at 7:30AM trying to find white stretch pants for my daughters costume for school. I couldnâ€™t find them anywhere! I was approached by Hermi and Char. They asked if they could help. I stated my case and they both tried to help but were unable to locate the pants I needed. I said â€œ Thank you for trying!â€  I shopped for another 10 minutes and as I was checking out, I hear â€œ Sir! Sir!â€. I turn around to see the 2 employees, bringing me a pair of white stretch pants for my daughter. They were both a little winded as they must of looked high and low to find the missing piece of my daughters costume.  I have worked in 5 diamond establishments for the last 25 years. I DID NOT expect this type of customer service at Wal-Mart! So much so, that I felt compelled to write this review.  Iâ€™m not sure if you have a employee appreciation program but these two ladies helped make sure my daughter wasnâ€™t sad at school on the BIG costume day.  Thank you ladies!  Warm regards,  Matthew Merrill"
572,46992,J Richardson,31/10/2018,Walmart,Disappointing day at Walmart. Took a load of returnable bottles and cans in for a refund. The machine kicked the first bottle (a common label) right back out at me. I had several bottles of this brand so I did not bother struggling with the machine and took all of my returnables back out to the car.  Returned to the store looked for a refill size bottle of Pomegranate SoftSoap. They did not carry this type in the refill size. Went on to look for a fabric shower liner sheet. The store display appeared to have only one type. The fabric of which had a satisfactory feel to the texture. I purchased it only to find when I got it home and unfolded that it did not have metal grommets at the hook holes only stitched button holes which will not last very long. With how the sheet was package one could not tell this. Considering time and gas to travel to Walmart it is not worth the effort to take it back.  Took my returnable bottles and cans to another store whose machines took all of them without a hitch.
573,46412,Casey Warner,31/10/2019,Walmart,"I wish I could leave a negative star rating. I have shopped at Walmart for years and have had mixed experiences with them , but one particular Walmart in Seaford Delaware is the worst Walmart I have ever seen. I ordered groceries through the grocery app, because I wanted to try it. They of course screwed it up, brought me items I did not even order, every egg in the carton was broken and my rolls were smashed. Took the items back that I did not order and said they would do a refund which even after multiple calls still did not happen. You can never find more than 1 maybe 2!at the most lanes open with cashiers, yet 15 employees can be standing around doing nothing. My last trip to Walmart really pushed me over the edge, like anyone else I am always looking for a good deal so I search their site before I go shopping. I make sure the location is set for the store I am shopping. I finished shopping and proceeded to the register. I very nicely told the cashier that certain items were ringing up wrong and showed her on my phone on their app what the price was listed for. She called over someone else. I did not notice his name but if you shop at this store he is tall and skinny with shoulder length brown straggly hair and his face looks like he may have tried to grow a beard but just has patches of facial hair. I showed him the same thing I had shown the cashier. I made sure my item matched the item on line perfectly. He told me the item I wanted was not in stock and he would not honor that price. ( how is it not in stock when it is sitting right in front of you) I argued with him and still stuck to his story that they were not in stock. He was rude and cocky and arrogant. I was calm and polite the entire time , yet he became more belligerent with each word. You should never speak to a customer the way he spoke to me and on a side note someone who looks as scummy and obviously unbathed as he did has no place to be so cocky and arrogant. I did call corporate and report this store and also their employee."

575,46414,Guy,31/10/2019,Walmart,"Customer service almost non-existent. Our Walmart has all cosmetics locked up. This would be fine but you can never find someone to open up the cabinets in a timely manner. Often you end waiting for 15 to 30 minutes before anyone responds to the bells. Most of the cash registers are now self service, and the only time you end up seeing a Walmart associate is if your buying tobacco, or when they are rummaging through your bag verifying your receipt as you leave. Seems if they would do their job and run the registers, then they wouldn't have to invade your bags and verify your receipt. That should only be needed if the alarm goes off. All in all, their new system is not working, and they have even forbidden backpack style purses because of their new ways of doing things."
576,46415,Christina Barry,31/10/2019,Walmart,"We ordered a Halloween costume for my ten-year-old son from walmart.com and were promised delivery the day before Halloween. About 36 hours before Halloween, we got an email that said they canceled our order. After 30 minutes chatting with Walmart customer service, their best solution was to process a refund... Which had already been done... And then send the complaint on to the vendor. I will never order from them again."
577,36172,Thomas D,31/10/2018,Amazon Go,"It's unique...Like big brother is watching everything. On the one hand it it quite convenient, easy and fast to provide yourself with food. You only need to download the Amazon Go app, log in to your Amazon account and scan the code on your phone to enter the store. On the other hand Amazon knows more and more of your behavior, records and stores datas of you, etc. I donâ€˜t know yet, what exactly I should think about this future supermarket. Product range is limited, but I could have bought Weihenstephaner wheat beer, which is brewed in my current home town in Germany, which I was surprised of."

579,42092,Bernard Vanderydt,31/10/2021,Walmart,"One of my orders at Walmart never arrived. Despite my address being entered properly on Walmart.com, the delivery receipt Walmart shared with me when I enquired about my order showed a delivery address without the street number... and signed by a complete stranger.  When I asked for a refund, the customer service indicated that my only recourse was to contest the charge with my bank.  This is the last time I order on Walmart.com"
580,42093,Pamela farley,31/10/2021,Walmart,Today I went thru self checkout scan all my items the employee came over and check and said that everything was OK. After I paid for my items security came after me and said that I didn't scan anything. Then he took me to customer service and was very rude to me and embarrassed me and then had every one watch me. So I won't be shopping at the Streamwood Location anymore caused I was mistreated. Streamwood Walmart has very bad customer service. Treating people unfairly caused of their race.
581,42094,RON,31/10/2021,Walmart,"I give 3 stars bc normally when we order through WM we get an average experience. We order through you, order gets delivered. Nothing special or worth leaving a review for. Not the case with our order from Joybuy America. My wife made an order from them thru WM. Package was basically destroyed when received and the product had some kind of corrosion. Unacceptable to say the least. Have made attempts to contact seller to no avail. Have also tried contacting shipper (FedEx) Nothing!?!? Will never order another thing from Joybuy again if not resolved and this just another reason not to use FedEx."
582,42095,D. B,31/10/2021,Walmart,"Via an ad on facebook, I ordered a Gazebo on clearance sale. The site listed it was from ""playwelled"" and brought me to a Walmart website, leading to believe this product from playwelled was hosted/ promoted by Walmart.  The confirmation email came back all in Chinese. About a month later, my 'product' arrived. Same tracking code etc... but what arrived was a tiny necklace, not a 10x12 metal gazebo.  The company contact has not been responsive, so I've flagged this as a scam and have disputed it on my credit card."

584,42097,Elyse C,31/10/2021,Walmart,"What is going on with Walmart? The only thing they are doing well is returns but I guess they have to do that with SO many things BEING returned! Quality is way down, customer service is crumbling & most other services are crashing. Why get this big if you aren't going to care about what matters?  They started Walmart + & probably to make some money back on what they're losing. It would be good if they were consistently GOOD. I am a member, originally to see if it was beneficial however now it's to ensure they follow through. It's much easier to say I'm paying extra & won't be if this or that isn't taken care of as promised. It makes them MORE accountable but it's truly beyond sad since companies used to be accountable simply for whatever they were providing.  Walmart there are major issues & so many other places are delivering now without yearly/monthly fees. I highly suggest you take a hard look & fix your leaks. 2 stars for the returns being better than walmart as a whole, doesn't say much though."
585,46982,Angela,13/11/2018,Walmart,"On Friday, November 9th, I placed an online order for an electric toothbrush. For two days, the order status displayed ""processing"" followed by a complete order cancellation on Sunday around 10:30pm. Right when the order was canceled, I contacted Walmart customer service to get some answers. The representative told me that the order was canceled because it was placed on a device different from what was registered to the Walmart account... I was told to wait 30 minutes before placing the order again, but this time on the same device the account was created on.  I waited one whole hour and placed the order again Sunday night around 11:50pm. Come Monday night around 10:00pm, the order was still listed as ""processing"" so I decided to call customer service again to check on my order. The representative told me the order is good to go for shipping soon and everything was working fine.  Not to blow your mind or anything, but today, Tuesday, November 13th at around 1:00 pm, my order was canceled... I called Walmart customer service AGAIN to figure out what the hell was going on. I told the rep my order was canceled twice now and he told me the same, exact story I was told the last time my order was canceled. ""Wait 30 minutes before placing your order again."" I told the rep I was told the same thing the other day and he needed to do more research into the order. After being place on hold for a good length of time, he told me he would escalate the situation to the ""manager"" and to wait 24 HOURS to place the order again...  I am so disappointed and frustrated. This whole experience makes me not even want to shop at Walmart online or in store anymore."

590,44171,Katie Stalder,13/11/2020,Walmart,"I would rate them zero stars if I could. I have NEVER had an easy or positive experience with Walmart.com! Every time I deal with their nonsense and horrible customer service, I tell myself I will never again shop with Walmart. And every time I break down because they supposedly have something Iâ€™m looking for I regret it. This past incident sealed the deal. Iâ€™m done. I ordered a bike for my daughter for her birthday (her party was canceled twice due to COVID), the bike shipment was delayed. Okay, not the end of the world, finally itâ€™s arriving, my daughter tracks the FedEx driver from her window jumping up and down so excited.. we open it up and instead of the 24â€ bike we ordered (that was in stock when ordered) we received a 29â€ bike for 6â€™ and taller. Huge bummer. Customer service was a huge headache. I was on the phone for over 40 minutes. I could barely understand the lady. Apparently they sold out of the bike we ordered so they put a different one that was the same price but not comparable at all. They want me to now drive to return it. The only option is a refund that will come next week sometime. Cool. Now I have to re shop for a bike, obviously from a different store, and wait another 2 weeks for delivery. And Iâ€™m out the $160 for a week it so, plus the $140 to buy a new bike from Amazon. I will NEVER deal with Walmart again! When I was there last year I specifically went to a certain store because they site said it was in stock. I spoke to 7 employees trying to find the item, no one could help. They told me that their â€œIn Stockâ€ does not actually mean it is in stock... what?! I explained Target can tell me how many are in stock and where they are located in each store and Iâ€™ve never had an issue, the Customer Service employee respond with â€œoh yeah, I love target!â€ Iâ€™m out. Save yourselves all the hassle and NEVER deal with this. Itâ€™s not worth it."

Yesterday I tried online at 12,3,6 and 9 to get the Paystation 5 and every time I got to the cart to pay and it looked like I had it all my charge information was in and never got the Playstation 5. It was awful. Now I have to keep trying to get it for my grandson. What happened to just putting it on a shelf and people going to the store and waiting in line to get it. I know it's a pandemic but you can still wait in line 6 ft apart at least you know where you stand."

594,44175,Mark Adams,13/11/2020,Walmart,"I waited all year to buy a TV because I knew they would go on sale for black Friday. Iciar Walmart had their BLACK FRIDAY ad for a 55 "" Smart tv for $148.00 starting at 7 PM online only. I was online at 6:30 waiting until it was available to place in my cart and as soon as I placed it in my cart I immediately tried to pay for it and i received a message that said it was out of stock at 7:01. I tried the online chat with Walmart 2 no avail. I called corporate Walmart and they said that I should open an account with Walmart online. I explained to them that I did have an account online although it take several minutes of him talking over me for him to listen. Then he said I should have been faster than I was. I threatened him with a class action lawsuit and posting our conversation to Facebook and he hung up on me. At it kills me that they are still advertising these TV's that they do not have. So I rate them as zero as well."

596,44177,Jon,13/11/2020,Walmart,"I tried to purchase a TCL 55"" Roku Smart TV that went on sale at Walmart on 11/11/20 at 7:00pm. Although I attempted to make the purchase right when the sale started, I received an out of stock message. Looking through deal sites later that night I found out that for most people, the â€œdealâ€ was gone in 60 seconds or less. I also found out, too late, that Walmart then â€œmagicallyâ€ found more stock of this TV at 7:30, 8:00, and 8:30 that evening. At 10:04 the next morning their website indicated that there were 94 available, but when I tried to add one to my cart I was told that it was out of stock. When I went back to the main page, it still said that there were 94 available. At 3:29 that afternoon the main page indicated that 83 were available, but the same thing happened. At 9:30 that night I was actually able to add it to my cart, but when I tried to check out, surprisingly it was out of stock. Immediately afterwards I was able to add it to my cart again, with the same result...rinse and repeat. At 10:31pm the website showed that the TV was available for pickup locally, but the â€œadd to cartâ€ was gone. Even though this TV is clearly unavailable, Walmart has the nerve to continue to prominently feature it on their â€œBlack Friday Deals for Daysâ€ page (â€œDeals for Secondsâ€ would be more accurate). This experience has really soured my opinion of Walmart. They obviously only obtained a token stock of this TV that they featured so prominently, and then distributed their miniscule stock in a staggered way that was very unfair to those who attempted to purchase the item when it was scheduled to go on sale. To then rub salt in the wound, their website has repeatedly indicated that the TV was available when it wasnâ€™t. This is in stark contrast to the very positive Black Friday experiences Iâ€™ve had at Best Buy and Home Depot. Walmart offering deals that they have no intention of honoring is an awful way to treat their customers. I greatly resent Walmartâ€™s sales practices, their poorly managed website, and the time Iâ€™ve wasted pursuing this rigged â€œdealâ€. From the many concerns Iâ€™ve seen expressed here and at other sites, my experience is not an isolated incident. I suggest that in the future, we direct our time and money elsewhere."
597,44178,Bernadine Browning,13/11/2020,Walmart,The Black Friday sale that start on Wednesday Nov 11 at 7pm was already OUT of STOCK on the TV that 128.00 for 50 inch before the sale started. Walmart should give a rain check or give another TV for the same price. This is no way to do business!!

Like many I had it in my card and after the battle of errors and crashes got to confirm purchase and sold out. How was that even possible? What the f***!! I had it in my cart each time they went on sale today. I swear it was a scam. Im saying class action lawsuit.
601,44182,mimi alga,13/11/2020,Walmart,"Walmart should have prepared better for the PlayStation 5 launch. Bot blockers, maybe when the item is in cart it should lock that in!

604,44185,Cody Smith,13/11/2020,Walmart,"Walmart website is a joke. Always crashing and giving me errors when I was almost done with my ps5 order. By the time the page reloaded, they were sold out. Screw you walfart"

606,44187,Jim Bohlin,13/11/2020,Walmart,There so no loyalty to those who keep the business alive daily. But when the holidays come along and something good is available you cant get it. Please show some respect for those who keep you in business. I think this will fall on deaf ears. I know I will no longer shop here. But I am sure the one time shopper will keep the doors open. Good luck
607,44188,Latrell Johnson,13/11/2020,Walmart,I was in the delivery page for the ps5 then it kept on asking me the same question and it took a minute just to get the next question and then when I got to got to proceeding the check out it said out of stock Walmart fix your things I am very furious
608,44189,Brent Sanders,13/11/2020,Walmart,"Walmart is pitiful. how you advertise black Friday items to buy online at certain times then as soon as its time and as soon as you order the items and sold out within 20 f@$%&$! seconds!! Ant no way, you never had the dam products to be advertising. then you say your restocking and it will be available 30 min later and still the same thing 20 seconds and sold out. this is False Advertisement and you could be sued in court for that. I'm real surprised someone hasn't done that already."
609,44190,scott frazier,13/11/2020,Walmart,"Walmart has a very poor ordering system ps5 went on sale today was waiting with my phone and pc ,kept hitting refresh till i saw add to cart. added it to cart hit confirm purchase and !!!!!CRASH!!!!!!! all 4 times guess my son's not getting one for Christmas now. it get so frustrating doing all you can waiting in line for preorders only to get turned down because you were there first or spending most of the day hoping one will pop up at a site but wont because alot will end up on ebay for a profit. People like caregivers with families first responders and military who are to busy to stand in line or surf the web all day miss out. WAY TO GO PLAYSTATION AND WALMART."
610,44191,Edna Salas,13/11/2020,Walmart,Had the ps5 cart went to check out and it wouldn't let me check out. Really bad
611,44192,Mason,13/11/2020,Walmart,"The PlayStation 5 online order system is completely a joke, I have spent the entire day at every single interval listed to get a PlayStation 5 order online as advertised...I had the ps5 in my cart and as quickly as humanly possible with my Walmart account and saved payment and shipping option and the company (Walmart) had under sold my system from my cart in the middle of the transaction...F&*% you Walmart and your bull sh** online atrocious ordering system.. Ther si no excuse for this kind of behavior on your supposed first come first serve lies....i will never shop at any of your locations either online or in person again. I had my ps5 in my cart and in the middle of my checkout with my loyal account stolen 3 times now before I could pay as fast as humanly possible with an extremely high internet connection. This is absolutely unacceptable and my family will never again visit your establishments either online or in person again for any business and my 5 person household along with many friends that experienced this same horse sh** abuse will never do business with your company again.....FU** your company and inexcusable negligence. We don't even have to justify or assume the amount of business you have lost and will lose due to your lack of fair and undue negligence of not having the courtesy or proper process of first come first serve policy...Fu** you."

613,44194,frank,13/11/2020,Walmart,"Whoever is in charge of Walmart's online services should be fired and get someone in there who can fixed this debacle!!  I didn't just have the PS5 in my cart, each time at 12pm, 3pm, and 6pm (on the dot) I just had to click checkout and I'd be done. My payment and shipping information is already saved in the system and the POS website just gave me errors every time. I know for damn sure people weren't getting their purchase confirmation already; on the hour each time, so they just F*@$ed me over sideways because they still haven't fixed the processing issue that they knew would happen.  Walmart online service Director... YOU SUCK BALLS!!!"
614,44195,Chris MaDan,13/11/2020,Walmart,had a horrible experience trying to order a product online. website crashed right on checkout. they did nothing to rectify sitiuation. horrible service
615,44196,Rick Mills,13/11/2020,Walmart,This was a BS way to sell the PS5. Wasted all day trying to checkout with the PS5 in my cart every time an error over and over then sold out. If itâ€™s in my cart and Iâ€™m paying for it howâ€™s it sold out. Go back to tangible items in the store! This makes me never want to shop at Walmart again! No more money for Walmart you wasted enough of my time!
616,44197,Suzy,13/11/2020,Walmart,Wal-Mart is not worth the one star if I could take it away! I had the PS5 in my cart and my payment was entered and then it said sorry this item is sold out!
617,44198,Jordyn Seto,13/11/2020,Walmart,If I could write 0 stars I would in a heartbeat!! If I have a item in my cart it should be put on hold for a certain time or until I pay for it!!! Itâ€™s B.S. someone can just come to my cart and take my items before I check out!!!
618,44199,Mary Samuels,13/11/2020,Walmart,"This is a joke! I had the PS5 in my cart and through checkout at each time launched 12, 3, 6 and 9. The website would have â€œtechnical difficultiesâ€ and throw me out. Refreshed to be informed sold out. So frustrating!!!!"
619,44200,Sophia Jules,13/11/2020,Walmart,"Tried many times to purchase ps5 for my grandson. Very frustrating. Shows its in cart, input all info then wait in circles to find it is out of stock. Should be a better way!!!"
620,44201,s bruce,13/11/2020,Walmart,"Walmart sucks, had the PS5 in my cart every time on launch day at all appointed times and due to their suck website that times out and errors until â€œout of stockâ€ even though I got to shipping options I am feeling really cheated. I laugh that you want to take on Amazon with your Walmart+. I will vote with my wallet and stop using you."
621,44202,DaMoniiTv,13/11/2020,Walmart,This store is absolutely fuc*ing shi* they canâ€™t do anything right absolutely nothing right at all fix your online service now!!! Itâ€™s a joke just like your store ... apparently the retar** who run your online site canâ€™t tell thatâ€™s itâ€™s bots over flooding your site like god yâ€™all are actually the most dumbest mf* I know absolutely shi* customer service and shi* website do not purchase from here ever! Never again I swear to god never again fuc*in dumb bitc***
622,44203,Malin Chloe,13/11/2020,Walmart,"Horrible, their website crashes, at the most important times. they set up 4 different times to buy the ps5 and still weren't prepared for it. nor did they carry it in stores. they are horrible and deserve less than 1 star."
623,44204,Walmart some ass,13/11/2020,Walmart,"""ReStOcK at 12, 3, 6, aNd 9"" didn't even get to add to cart because the website crashed immediately. Embarrasing for the biggest retailer in the world to have such a terrible release of a console. Eventually I'll get one but it wont be from walmart."
624,44205,Zol Duck,13/11/2020,Walmart,"Walmart website is terrible, i was online for all times exactly on the dot, even being ready like 10 minutes early constantly refreshing the page, when they were releasing the ps5 and had it in my cart every single time, went to check out and got an error, refreshed and kept trying only to see it was removed from my cart and marked as out of stock, how do you know youâ€™re selling multiple high market items that are gonna bring a lot of people in and not even be ready for it, completely wasted so much of my time, I wouldnâ€™t shop here anymore even if it was the only store on earth."
625,44206,Walmart is trash,13/11/2020,Walmart,Good job guys cant even handle a ton of people on your website got to reviewing my payment well then no stock with the ps5 good job. Getting all this money cant even have a good website to handle people on it yall are trash honestly. Completely trash
626,44207,Ramon LebrÃ³n,13/11/2020,Walmart,"Itâ€™s sad, the fact that Walmart lies to costumers. Donâ€™t advertise BS, I guess Iâ€™ll take my $$$ elsewhere!!!"
627,44208,Michael Pratt,13/11/2020,Walmart,If i am able to add an item to my cart is should be reserved for 10 minutes for me so i can fill out the payment and shipping information. If it isnt going to be available DONT LET ME ADD IT TO MY CART!!
628,44209,heather Paterick,13/11/2020,Walmart,Think itâ€™s disheartening to try and get a PS5 and have it in check out! I even had a confirmation to only get an error message after my â€œpurchaseâ€! This whole process is messed up and very fishy. ESPECIALLY reading Twitter and hearing from hundreds of people knowing the same thing happened to them. It feels almost as exhilarating as winning a new car only to be completely blindsided to learn you never purchased it in the first place.
629,44210,david camacho,13/11/2020,Walmart,What a piece of you know what. Upgrade your site when you know there is going to be a mad rush to buy the hottest item that has hit the shelf in years. Website kept freezing up. Would have been the first thing Iâ€™ve bought at Walmart in 15 years because I donâ€™t shop their for a reason. This just adds to the list.
630,44211,Tracy,13/11/2020,Walmart,"I went online every posted hour for x box series x and ps 5 and every time they loaded in my cart then went to pay... the system crashed, it pulled them out of my cart and stated out of stock!!!! What a scam and a waste of two days!! Shattered Xmas dreams too!!! Unbelievable!! I followed the rules why didnâ€™t they.. it was in my cart several times!!"
631,44212,Andrea Smith,13/11/2020,Walmart,"Walmart's process for the PS5 was absolute trash. Their site lagged so much and had so many technical difficulties, it didn't matter if you hit checkout as soon as the product dropped. It took so long to load, you would get all the way to review your order (sometimes) and then it would pop up saying that the item was out of stock. This is the worst experience I have ever had trying to order anything. Such a poor customer experience by Walmart and PlayStation as a whole. I even had all of my information pre-filled out in my account so that shipping and billing was already done, and then it would want me to re-fill out the information instead of allowing me to choose from my saved information. Very, very disappointed in Walmart's customer service on this."
632,44213,John lever,13/11/2020,Walmart,"You suck Walmart, I'm trying to get the PS5 then I'm getting 100 error messages saying it can't be added into my car then 3 min later when I go to the cart it's putting my ass in a waiting room and loading forever, man Walmart step up"
633,44214,LaShana Gray Minns,13/11/2020,Walmart,Walmart has done a terrible job in handling the PS5 release.
634,44215,Anixander Worthy,13/11/2020,Walmart,"If I could give less than one if I could. How can you advertise that you would have PS5 and list what times you would make them available, and then not have them available? This is total and complete garbage."
635,44216,Richard Rigby,13/11/2020,Walmart,Had the ps5 in my cart and ready to check out and got to my address the the cart froze for 5 mins and then a message told me it was sold out after their error four times today. Cart crashed every time I tried to check out today only to get the sold out notices. Very big Disappointment. To make matters worse they don't even care. Walmart's attitude is we don't care you will still shop with us.  I am about over Walmart!
636,44217,Reggie Taylor,13/11/2020,Walmart,I had the PS5 in my cart and press proceed to cash out it just keep spinning then a error reads pops up with some reindeer dog if itâ€™s in my cart and I have all my information in I press proceed a error shouldnâ€™t pop up.
637,44218,mcristo,13/11/2020,Walmart,"Had new ps5 in my cart 4 times today at noon, 3pm, 6pm and now at 9pm but system freezes when wanting to check out. Afterwards it said the item was sold out  Thanks walmart - you managed to disappoint my kid four times in one day."
638,44219,Travis A,13/11/2020,Walmart,Tried 4 separate times to get the PS5 during the multiple release times. It either got me to the last page then loaded for 4 minutes and said out of stock or just kept loading. Waste of time. I get theres high volume but i don't feel it should have happened all 4 times
639,44220,Kalli,13/11/2020,Walmart,"Walmart has made a few mistakes with my curbside groceries in the past, but their customer service is amazing and have easily rectified any billing issues I had. Iâ€™m starting to like Walmart more than Aldi which is saying something about Aldiâ€™s customer service."
640,44221,Nick Moore,13/11/2020,Walmart,Honestly 1.6 star review average is to high for Walmart.com. If selecting no stars was an option Iâ€™d pick that. Itâ€™s amazing that one of the biggest companies in the USA can fail so hard on so many levels.
641,44222,James Crossland,13/11/2020,Walmart,This company is so crappy. Had both new consoles in cart both days and all 4 times for the PS5 and they crashed every time. Fire your whole team. everyone who engineered your site it is total trash. I will never online shop here again.
642,44223,Dan Larimer,13/11/2020,Walmart,I had the same thing for pS2 I will not be buying from Walmart this year at all. It's a scam.
643,44224,kb,13/11/2020,Walmart,Had the ps5 in my cart and ready to check out got to my address it to freeze for 5 mins and tell it was sold out after their error.
644,44225,Katherine Terry,13/11/2020,Walmart,The first time browsing is not smooth and the price is high
645,44226,Chuck,13/11/2020,Walmart,"I was stupid enough to fall for the 55"" tv scam as well. They will never be a contender with Amazon with their crappy business practices."
646,36299,Laurie L.,13/11/2019,Amazon Go,So easy! Helpful gentleman will explain how to use your app. After that you can peruse and select from protects racing from chips to beverages. I got power bowl and the flat steak. Not were way better than expected considering its convenience food. The steak was very tender. The power bowl was filling. My hubby said that the lasagna was very good! Fun way to eat out.
647,42008,barbara moore,13/11/2021,Walmart,Worse online ordering ever....DO NOT ORDER ONLINE AT WALMART!!!!! I made a purchase online and arranged to pick the item up which was over 2 hours away from me.... when I get 10 min away they canceled my order. I was left on the phone and transferred to multiple foreign people and they never solved my problem. Walmart doesn't care because they figure we are going to continue to shop there anyways......im never ordering anything from them again amazon is much better
648,42009,Bradley Joseph,13/11/2021,Walmart,Customer service was awful. It was a real chore to get someone to help me and when I did it was like I was bothering them. I never really got the help I needed and I decided to shop elsewhere.

651,46981,Ken,14/11/2018,Walmart,I use grocery pickup almost every week with an average amount of 100 dollars. Sensible substitions are made for unavailable items or can be refused. Prices are good and even items besides groceries can be sdded..I have not had problems with any regular online orders either.

655,44157,David Johnston,14/11/2020,Walmart,"I am going to make this short , some details are left out that would further explain my very bad experience at Walmart. I went to the pharmacy, I was the only person in line . I was asked to come up to the register. I gave my name and birthdate and asked for a prescription that was texted in and received a message it was ready to be picked up. The cashier asked me to go to the drop off window. I did there wasn't anyone else working there. The cashier then left to go out in the aisles to help a woman find baby oil , then she used her phone. I went and asked her if other people were ahead of me. She stated that she was done at 6 , and that there was people ahead of me. She then told me my prescriptions was not ready and I would have to come back. I told her that I needed it then and would wait. She said loudly that she would have to put it in as a emergency and asked me if I would like that. I told her I needed it. ( I do need it for my entire life). She then had it filled. I left feedback with Walmart of my experience. After that I received a call from the pharmacy about it. This made me very uncomfortable, and now it is very awkward to go there. My insurance pays thousands of dollars to Walmart for my needed prescriptions. I feel like I need to go to a different place now because of the awkwardness going there. This is a very big hassle for me. The cashier was very bad and Walmart was very bad by having me confronted directly by the pharmacy calling me."
656,44158,M Deluco,14/11/2020,Walmart,So I ordered a Black Friday deal. 50 inch tv. Got a delivery date of 11/18....on 11/14 I got an email saying that my delivery would arrive early on the very same day.!!! Then after waiting all day I contacted customer service and was told I was going to be issued a refund....WTH. I didn't ask for a refund...total BS. Stick with Amazon....
657,44159,Dez Anne,14/11/2020,Walmart,"I had ordered from a few times and the service was okay until last weekend. I placed a delivery order to be left at my door and my driver arrived demanding me to come find his car in the rain because he did not have a bag. AND THEN, last night I had a delivery scheduled to be delivered between 4pm and 5 pm. At 7:30 pm, my groceries had still not arrived and I had absolutely zero correspondence from Walmart with a delivery update so I spent about an hour trying to ahold of customer service. They told me they could not get my order delivered that night and it would have to be the next day. Around this time I finally got an email saying that my groceries were out for delivery. About 15 minutes later my driver arrives with 1 bag of chips. The restoration my my $116 order nowhere to be found. Unbelievably terrible experience. I am canceling my my membership."
658,44160,Isa C,14/11/2020,Walmart,Don't ever buy anything online from walmart.com especially a black Friday item bc it will allow you to buy it and then cancel your order. This always happens. It happened to me last year too. NEVER AGAIN THERE WEBSITE SUCKS.I WILL STICK WITH AMAZON THEY NEVER HAVE THAT ISSUE!
659,44161,Charles Sharp,14/11/2020,Walmart,"I ordered an Oster toaster oven with same day pick up at a Super Store near me. The site showed 2 in the store. I drove to the store, followed the signs to â€œpick upâ€. The area was empty. I looked in my e-mail to see if there were any instructions. It told me that they had received my order but said please donâ€™t come to the store until we contact you. At 6:00 pm I received an e-mail notice that my order, which I had paid for, had been canceled. I tried their customer service help line and after following the directions I finally received the message â€œgood news our agent has joined the conversation.â€ Then a message that the agent had left the conversation and suggested that I end it and start over.  I contacted the store and told them that the item was still showing â€œin stockâ€ and she told me that they showed a lot of things in stock that they didnâ€™t have.  When I hung up, I ordered the toaster over from Amazon. It has shipped and will be on my porch tomorrow without me needing to go pick it up or pay for phantom ideas."
660,44162,Joseph Ogle,14/11/2020,Walmart,"Walmart and other retailers have dropped the ball on the Xbox Series X and Playstation 5 launch. Knowing that bots are making purchases before actual gamers and families trying to secure a device, they still continue to make these items online only. I'd like to know who is over the entire Walmart sales team because they are not that bright. i know of several locations that have stock on hand and they refuse to sell them stating that they are for their Black Friday sale only. That's a dumb decision, since the scalpers will be ready when those items go live. I realize that Walmart, other retailers, Sony and Microsoft do not care who purchases an item as long as it's purchased, but this shows no loyalty whatsoever to customers at all. I wish that we could stop shopping collectively at all of their locations for a few weeks to see how that would affect their bottom line. Let them see if scalpers would be willing to purchase all of their everyday items from Walmart to keep them afloat. I would love to leave a rating of ""0"" on this matter, but unfortunately that's not an option. I would love to have a means to directly contact someone in their corporate offices and see how they can explain this."
661,44163,GigiV shion,14/11/2020,Walmart,They were releasing PS5s online and had no way to prevent scalpers from using bots to buy them out. I highly doubt anyone actually got a PS5 based on the comments walmart was receiving online. Throughout the day customers were asking walmart to place a captcha to prevent scalpers from overloading the site and buying everything out and it went ignored. Now all the ps5s that were on sale for 499 are now on ebay for 1200 instead. Not to mention that it didn't matter if the item was in your cart. If you weren't fast enough to hit place order it could still be out of stock and it happened to me 3 times.
662,44164,Jen Hillesheim,14/11/2020,Walmart,Online Black Friday deal for days experienceâ€”â€” Studio light out of stock in 3 minutes? What did you have 4? Very disheartening for me when my child looked forward to it. And by time Iâ€™m able to go to store for one they be gone so why bother. Going to amazon for it. Limits would of been nice as Iâ€™m sure several people bought dozens to resell.
663,44165,matt smith,14/11/2020,Walmart,App so they 100% a f******* joke nothing worked liked it should from a company like this what a disappointment
664,44166,Annie Bridges,14/11/2020,Walmart,"I ordered a birthday gift. It was to be delivered a week before my daughter's birthday. Its 2 days until her birthday and no delivery. I will change this rating if it gets here on time for her party. But, it's doubtful. Do what you say you're going to do, or people won't believe anything you say."
665,44167,Mary Richardson,14/11/2020,Walmart,"Every time I try to order from Walmart and they have FedEx delivery, I have problems receiving my packages. Either they come days after they promise delivery or it ends up being cancelled!"
666,44168,Lee Robbins,14/11/2020,Walmart,"List â€œFree Deliveryâ€ and shows that in the price before ordering; later email adds a substantial delivery fee. Customer support says not sure we can fix this and nothing I can do. Other items are listed and then repeatedly turn out not to be available. Amazon has NEVER done this, Instacart has occasional errors but rapidly corrects them. What is the problem that Walmart canâ€™t manage online shopping in 2020?"
667,36222,Heather N.,14/11/2018,Amazon Go,"So cool!  It felt like I was in the future.  I had to check out Amazon Go while in Seattle.  I downloaded the app before I arrived and was ready to go.  Don't wait until you get there and then hold up the line/block the entrance while your are downloading the app.  I looked around, picked up and put back several things before leaving.  My receipt was emailed to me within minutes and was accurate.    I would love for this technology to be more widely available.  I can be impatient.  Many times I have left a store without buying because I was only getting a few things and the lines weren't worth the wait."
668,36352,Sao S.,14/11/2019,Amazon Go,"Such a cool experience. You scan your Amazon account to get into the store and just walk out with all of the things you want to purchase. Then in a few hours, you'll get a receipt with all the items you brought out of the store. Make sure you choose the right card you want your items to be paid with."
669,36211,KJ E.,14/11/2020,Amazon Go,"It is a go--- honestly I was confused at first. It was my first time in an Amazon Go so I didn't know where or how to pay for the water, batteries, and snacks I was getting. Maybe they could use a sign?  Nonetheless, pretty simple process of grabbing what I needed and jetting off. Things are a tad overpriced but that was expected."
670,42006,Tex,14/11/2021,Walmart,"Online Purchases Have to be Shipped Back. Purchased several items online on the Walmart website. Apparently when you make a purchase on Walmarts website, its all from third party. So if you have to return an item they will not accept the return in store. You will have to ship it back. I have learned a valuable lesson. Never purchased anything online through Walmarts website. And I really hate going into the Walmart stores for any purchase. The staff are horrible in Kannapolis NC. They scream at the customers and make racist comments. At least that was the case 8 to 9 months ago. Since then I have made it a point to steer clear. Maybe they have made changes."
671,42007,kb,14/11/2021,Walmart,I just received a delivery from Walmart. Was missing items. They want $13 a month for free shipping but they can't guarantee you'll get what you've ordered. They're quick to offer you a discount on your next order which must be over $35 to be included in the $13 a month free delivery plan and you have to tip another driver. How is this cost effective? Or sufficient? They want to compare themselves to Amazon and their reviews but they're not offering me TV they're not offering me music and I don't have to tip Amazon drivers and I don't have to worry that I'm going to get half an order with Amazon. Walmart really needs to step it up and provide decent service.

They want to compare themselves to Amazon and their reviews but they're not offering me TV they're not offering me music and I don't have to tip Amazon drivers and I don't have to worry that I'm going to get half an order with Amazon. Walmart really needs to step it up and provide decent service.
674,46980,WarSong â€œWarSongâ€,15/11/2018,Walmart,I still shop here. I almost have to. What I Hate more than anything is the SELF CHECKOUT.  STOP IT. NO! BAD WALMART!  If I wanted to check myself out I'd buy a mirror on Amazon.
675,46362,Timothy Green,15/11/2019,Walmart,Absolutely the worst shipping ever. Nothing is ever on time. Today a package said delivered. I was home. It didn't come. Got run around from Walmart and FedEx. If my package doesn't come by Tuesday I have to call FedEx and Walmart back. If it does not come I will ca cel Ok current orders and shop at Amazon. Walmart you suck
676,46363,Claribel Fierro,15/11/2019,Walmart,"If I could give them ZERO.... ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž.

Walmart â€œ suggestions â€œ to fix the problem is â€œ refund or reshipping â€œ . I can tell people Two things : UPS morons donâ€™t care and â€œ do â€œ deliveries at their convenience and LIE about their intentions of â€œ deliveries â€œ just saying that delivery were REFUSED .!!!! Itâ€™s second â€œ experience â€œ with UPS just not delivering a package. And Walmart..... just not doing anything to get a better delivery company.... CHEAP as UPS cheap employees doing wherever suits them.... ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®"
677,46364,Kristin Wesley,15/11/2019,Walmart,"I ordered a Batman action figure for my grandson for Christmas and paid for next day shipping. It's being delayed now. Why did I pay extra for next day shipping if it doesn't arrive the next day? I should have that amount refunded, but fat chance, I know."
678,46365,Dominique Clemon,15/11/2019,Walmart,"I ordered 4 items to be picked up today and the reason why I chose those items was because the site claimed that they were in stock at the store. The order was placed at 2:30 pm at 6:30 pm I sent someone to pick up the items as I couldn't make it to the store but as I said needed the items today she was told by an employee that the items were not ready and to wait for an email which in my opinion the same amount of time it took to say this the employee could have just walked and grabbed the items, she leaves the store and by 8:30 pm I received an email saying the items are still not ready well it's late now I no longer want the items but i would like my money back i call customer service to get a refund and they tell me it will take 5 business days.. this is strange to me being that it didn't take 5 days to take my money and me not having what I need isn't my fault at all. I'm done with Walmart!"
679,46366,None,15/11/2019,Walmart,"If I could give 30 negative stars I would, however to write this review I had to give at least 1 star. So Three Rivers, Mi Walmart denied me money that was sent from someone else, they ask me very personal questions just to pick up money and then at the end they denied giving me the money. What the heck, so I reached out to the person that sent me the money. The person goes to Walmart at there location and it saids it was refused by customer, are you serious. I am going to report this experience to the highest I can go."
680,44140,Marlys Fisher,15/11/2020,Walmart,If I could give it 0 stars I would. i have called customer service 3 times and got hung up on while trying to find out why the gift card I purchased for my daughter's birthday still does not work 3 months later. she has been treated poorly by the staff at Walmart and treated as if she is trying to run a scam when the card won't work. i will never shop at walmart. she was a loyal walmart shopper but you've lost her business too. your help center is utterly worthless.
681,44141,Slinguser,15/11/2020,Walmart,"I got lucky and was able to score a Walmart branded Roku TV for the holidays. The issue arise when the item is ready for pickup. The email received instructs go to the to pickup area click a link via the App or the Text message received. Nothing worked. I land at the pick up area where I was told to go inside to pick up. I go inside to pick up where the people who got items on the BF day deals are standing waiting for someone to show up. About 10 minutes later someone shows up and scans are email barcodes, and informs drive to the outdoor department area. I drive over only to find that Walmart cornered off turn so to get into the BF parking slots one has to exit Walmart onto the main road then U-Turn and enter from the car service department entrance. Why not just state this in the email for the select store so 45 minutes of my life is not wasted. Sadly, the good Black Friday deals scored get ruined by the pick up process."
682,44142,Joseph Hutton,15/11/2020,Walmart,"I ordered a reptizoo 35 gallon on 11/5/2020 and it was shipped fed ex. The package sat in portage pa for 3 days, with no delivery date. It was suppose to be delivered on Thursday 11/12/2020. Fed ex couldnâ€™t give me a reason why it was just sitting, so I called Walmart to cancel the order, then have another tank sent overnight since I was suppose to get a shipment of a new reptile on Monday 11/16/2020. Walmart said the fed ex didnâ€™t offer overnight services, Iâ€™ve used overnight services before.. Customer service between Walmart and Fed ex sucks!! I will never give either a good review as a matter of fact your service is about a -100!!!!"
683,44143,Linda Lee Bay,15/11/2020,Walmart,"I noticed when I was here that many brands have smaller containers and you receive less product, but pay the same price. I saw this in the cleaning products section and in the makeup. I also noticed other grocery items are more expensive than other stores. I only bought a few items here and left. I will be visiting some grocery stores and local drug stores to see if it is the same, but I have a feeling this cutting the amount of product in containers is exclusive to Walmart. Walmart is not a place to save money."
684,44144,PHILLIP GARNETT,15/11/2020,Walmart,The money transfers section in the worst ever. I wanted to send my girlfriend in Ghana $500. The customer service agent told me I was making an illegitimate transfer tantamount to money laundering. She refused to process the transaction. This was the Chehalis Wa Walmart. If you are not going to do transfers shut it down. My lady just needed a little help with Bill's. So I get accused of money laundering and told Ghana was a corrupt country. Dont use the Chehalis Walmart for money tranfers.
685,44145,Edward Chang,15/11/2020,Walmart,"Absolutely horrible experience. Ordered a $379 laptop and was given a $250 laptop by the store i picked it up from. When I noticed this they couldn't process a refund right away due to computer issues and I had to come back the next day. I was credited for the lower priced laptop and the associate had to spend about 20 mins on the phone with other staff to hopefully credit me the remaining amount, which i have yet to receive a confirmation on such as an email. Besides that, I did not get the item I wanted to buy and it is no longer in stock. One store associate tried to make it right by offering me a giftcard and I appreciate that, but my time is more valuable than $20 and I would appreciate it more if they could get the order right the first time. Please get in touch with me if you want to actually make it right and send the right product. This incident occurred at Walmart Cerritos.  Edward Chang"
686,44146,Cynthia,15/11/2020,Walmart,"How is it that my item from a black Friday sale successfully hit my cart,payment,goes through,confirmation email for pickup next day and wake this morning saying order cancelled from lack of stock!!!! There was still 2 left after I got mine. What kind of sales practice is this. I'm not paying the everyday price! I should get it for sale price because it's not MY mistake. Walmart is really failing at online this year! Too many mistakes!!!! Won't be using this service for Christmas now! Can't trust Christmas gifts will arrive. Can't be having my gifts cancelled."

688,44148,The Dude,15/11/2020,Walmart,"I am the caregiver of a special needs woman. During the holiday season last year, she had a tablet in the layaway but received a tablet as a gift from someone about a month later, so she decided to get her money back minus the fee. She goes to the layaway department to get her money back but comes back to me with tears in her eyes. They had only gave her $2 back of the $50 she had on the tablet. Turns out there's been some changes to the fine print of Walmart layaway which allows them to keep most of your money in the event you choose to terminate it. To add insult to injury, the employee laughed about it after it happened like taking the money of a special needs woman was the funniest thing in world. I haven't been able to get the bad taste out of my mouth of such cold-hearted customer service."
689,44149,Joseph Holmes,15/11/2020,Walmart,Was lucky enough to get 2 of the 65 inch TV they gad on Nov 4 Black Friday deals. One is fine the was broke. The problem is I want a replacement but being told I can only get a refund. This was told to me by customer service and at the store. Feel they should of kept some in the warehouse for just this issue. They have been very nice to talk to put wish they could have fixed the problem
690,44150,Frddrick Hernandez,15/11/2020,Walmart,"Went to the Walmart on military drive and Roosevelt. Worst store l have been to and never again. It is a cov19 magnet. Not following the six feet rule at the registers. Team leader standing right there checking out customer at the electronic section and didn't say anything. She would note me check out in the front thinking l was going to seal a 15.00 print cartridge so as as she checked me out customer 4 inches behind me. I told the team leader who was checking me out that what was the purpose of the marking on the floor if she as a leader wasn't going to enforce the rule. She just smiled as said, ok, but never told the customer behind me to move. I have filled out a complaint with the health department."
691,44151,Winlafaan Dantoumda,15/11/2020,Walmart,"Worse experience ever with Walmart, period! They cancelled my order after payment has been made. Reason: unable to fulfill due to high demand. Well, how in the world, are you selling what you don't have? Beware with Walmart.com! You are warned."
692,44152,lukasz moryl,15/11/2020,Walmart,Worst system ever. Guys do do not get it it is overrated and worth the 400$. Trust me. This system is not working how it should.
693,44153,Janice Osborn Breen,15/11/2020,Walmart,I was shocked to hear when I went to Walmart today that masks are no longer required. I am 81 and asthmatic and I don't feel safe. Probably about half the shoppers had masks on. I won't be coming back. Brookshire's still requires masks and social distancing so I will have to drive 30 miles to do my grocery shopping. Plus empty pallets were blocking the aisles. Bad business.
694,44154,Scott Johnston,15/11/2020,Walmart,They say they have the item in stock. They cancel my order without telling me and I missed another deal from another vendor because of their bait and a switch crap.
695,44155,Sandy,15/11/2020,Walmart,"Walmart Black Friday deals. Walmart is a joke, so i tried to order four items on pick up from Walmart as part of their black Friday deals. I choose my store and the items say they are in stock so I order. I wait about 4.5 hours and then I get an email that says my order has been canceled because all of my chosen items are out of stock. I log in to Walmart's site and again and I see it is still saying everything is in stock. I get in my car and drive to Walmart. NOT ONLY do I find my items in stock, there are a crap TON of them. I go to customer service to inquire why my order was canceled. they don't care, only want to know if I will pay for them now, never mind the hold on my credit card from the original order is still sitting there. They don't care about customer safety and I will disregard their so called Black Friday deals from now on."
696,44156,Cassie Lambert,15/11/2020,Walmart,"I ordered online on 11/13 and when I when to pick up my order, after receiving the text that it was ready, the employees had no record of my order even though the money was taken out of my bank account. I was informed that I will not get my money back for 3-5 business days. When I talked on the phone with customer service (for about an hour), they placed the same order for the following day. When going to pick up my order on 11/14, the same thing happened. So, I not only was not able to get groceries, I am now being forced to wait 3-5 business days for double the amount of money. I am now unable to feed myself or my 2 kids for another week because my only money is being held for groceries I never received. Since no one on the phone was able to help me, I was forced to go into the store and put myself at risk (even though I am high risk for COVID-19 complications and should not be out in public). I spoke to a manager there to try to find a way to feed my family for a week since Walmart wasnâ€™t able to fill my order and is holding my money. The only thing they were â€œable to doâ€, after another long conversation on customer service and a heated argument with the store manager, was to provide me with a $25 gift card (which will not feed my family of three for more than 3 meals). I am a frequent customer for online ordering and expected to be treated with more understanding and respect. I have worked in customer service for nearly 10 years and I have never seen/received such poor service, management, and helplessness, especially from such a large corporation. I am extremely disappointed in Walmart and am now more stressed than ever. I am most likely to never use Walmart to shop at ever again. If I could give Walmart 0 stars, I would."

711,46978,Mayank Tripathi,16/11/2018,Walmart,"My name is Mayank Tripathi, a holder of walmart rewards mastercard. In the beginning of this year 2018 I received a call from Wallmart banking service endorsing a ''Balance protection plan'' that I remember in the best of my attentive mind, denying and saying a clear No to. A month later on 13th March, I was surprised to find a $11.51 in my mastercard statement titled as ''Bal Insurance'' When I called Walmart to ask why I have been charged this amount, they said that I have been enrolled in the plan. I begged them to cancel the plan because I have never consented to it and the person on phone agreed and said that I have been taken out of the plan. I was resting assured after this that I will get the refund that I was charged. I failed to check my mastercard statements in detail for the next few months and today I found that I have been getting charged for the same balance protection plan every month on 13th. I called the customer care to complain but they said they cannot do anything and its between me and the bank. I asked to speak to a supervisor and he said the same. They failed to tell me how a 3rd party is deducting money from my account without my information and consent regarding a product that walmart wanted to sell me. They gave me the phone number for Canada life insurance and shrugged their shoulders. When I called Canada Life Insurance they told me that according to their reports, I (the customer) has called in and requested the plan from walmart. I was shocked to hear this because I did call the walmart banking but it was to cancel the plan and not ask for it. They said they can only refund me the amount charged for the last 3 months out of courtsey and will not refund the 6 months. When I asked for the box files (call recordings) of me speaking to the customer service and clearly saying NO to the plan they said only Ombudsman has the right to access it if they are willing to investigate. Following are the details of the people i have spoken to so far: Walmart customer care rep named Dean at around 12:10 pm today 15th Nov. Walmart Customer care Supervisor Marvin at 12:30 pm today 15th Nov. (No reference number or follow up no. was given regarding this call despite of me asking for it) Canada Life Insurance agent Scot at around 12:35 pm today 15th Nov. call reference no# 2896945 I have refused to accept and called to cancel this plan TWO times despite of which i was enrolled and charged for 9 months."
712,46979,kieran,16/11/2018,Walmart,"We the customer assistants in express stores are worked like dogs, we would love to be happy and smiling all of the time when we are working but the stores are understaffed, when you need the loo or you need a drink of water and you're the only person on the shop floor if the management are locked in the office you have to wait until they are finished otherwise they get annoyed at you.  Tesco Express are creating more ways for the staff to get into trouble with informal discussions, if we spend too long at the till making sure there are no customers waiting to be served and not wandering around to complete delivery we get told off and vice versa.  If customers are the heart of the company how can someone be disciplined for making sure no customers wait?  From the majority of customer assistants I apologize for the times we may come off as rude or distracted, we don't realize how bad it is because all we can think about is finishing work and going home to people who actually care about us, rather than having to work down several aisles on our own, cleaning up glass breakages while customers are waiting to be served, making sure the customers are safe by checking for safety hazards, cleaning around the self service and tills so no one can slip, having to argue with dangerously drunk people because it is against the law to serve alcohol to someone who is intoxicated, being called names by some customers and quite often male customers giving the female staff unwanted attention.  This is just a small review of something much bigger, please don't blame the majority customer assistants, we are trying to feed our families and yes some assistants are genuinely not very nice people but for the most of us we are thankful you still shop with us as without you we wouldn't have a job to provide to our families."
713,46360,Nichole Williams,16/11/2019,Walmart,I got an email saying my order was ready.

716,44136,Diane Gallagher,16/11/2020,Walmart,"I have used the Walmart Chat feature in connection with a couple bad experiences with the Grocery Delivery-Pick up. In each instance, the person in the Chat was friendly and professional. It is easy to select which is the order of concern so they can look up all the information on that order.  In both cases, I received refunds right at that time. One instance was an order that was never delivered and I had to pick up on my own the next day. They refunded the delivery fee to me.  The other instance, was an Express Order, for which you pay extra. There must have been some glitch in the app, because just a few minutes after placing the order, I received a notice that it was on its way, but the location was a different state. I then looked at my order status and that was correct, so I ignored the first.  Then I received a notice that my order had been delivered, but it had not been left at my door. I had been waiting for it, so I would have known if they had come and I also have a Ring Doorbell, so I would have seen or recorded anyone coming to the front door.  The delivery was supposedly at 7:53 pm. I called the store and was told that the grocery folks leave at 8:00 pm, so no one was answering when I was transferred to them. If they are going to have deliveries into the evening, they should not close until they know deliveries were made. I was told to wait until the morning to call back.  I decided to try the chat feature again. I had to wait a bit, but the agent was able to identify the driver and said the photo take was not helpful. I basically think someone just decided to keep my order as the photo really wasn't even an attempt to take a picture of items on a step or porch. It was mostly black with a vague object in it. I was refunded for my entire order during this chat.  Their Chat feature works well."

Several WalMart chats. More wait. More run around. November 15th I was told by WalMart rep Taylor via phone call it will be WEEKS before I receive a refund. Asked for supervisor...Nasi...states she escalated my refund. 1800s Pony Express or pigeon is faster for returns than this. WalMart needs lessons from Amazon's return department.

723,42020,C B,16/11/2021,Walmart,My credit card was charged for the wrong order November 6th. I returned the wrong order via Fed Ex in hopes of correct order. Never happened. Just run around. Several WalMart chats. More wait. More run around. November 15th I was told by WalMart rep Taylor via phone call it will be WEEKS before I receive a refund. Asked for supervisor...Nasi...states she escalated my refund. 1800s Pony Express or pigeon is faster for returns than this. WalMart needs lessons from Amazon's return department.

725,46355,Robin Root,17/11/2019,Walmart,I'm so frustrated! I ordered the lol surprise doll house little brother edition but got the little sister edition and when I called walmart they say I ordered the little sister edition! They also say I have to do an exchange in store and the stores say its not in stock! My little girl is going to be disappointed Christmas morning :(
726,46356,Sabrina Valentine,17/11/2019,Walmart,Don't ever buy a walmart battery. I have had to jump my car at least 40 times in 2.5 months and they kept putting the wrong cc amps to begin with so it passes. I have been stranded several times. Took it in today and it says discharged? So they are going to charge it and go from there. They probably didnt even put the right cc amps in it. This is why oem is so much better!!! You get what u pay for. Designed to keep pushing u off until warranty runs out.
727,46357,Tayla Godfrey,17/11/2019,Walmart,When I ordered items they were not as the description said and so they sent my whole order again instead of the 1 item that needed replaced. I was told that I had to send the rest back or I would be charged. I sent the other items back and had to fix the original item because the description was wrong. When I sent it back it took weeks to get the refund all the while I am still getting emails that says they are going to charge me because my items have not been returned. This was the most ridiculous and frustrating experience with online orders EVER. If you are thinking about ordering online DON'T DO IT
728,46358,Buenta Cole,17/11/2019,Walmart,This store has the worst customer service I have ever seen. No wants to help you find anything or they tell the store does not sell it. I have found items I was told was not sold by the store. If the sales people see you walking their way they go the opposite way. They donâ€™t seem to understand that if there are know customers there are no jobs. The sales associates need better training.
729,46359,Brenda Obeautiful,17/11/2019,Walmart,"Falken Sincera SN250 A/S 185/55R15 82 V Tire  Fair warning, stay clear of these tires. They are sold at Walmart through a 3 rd. party that sells used tires. After 2 weeks of going back and forth with Walmart about the status of the tires and when they are going to be delivered, they finally arrived at Walmart. WOW I was shocked when they finally arrived and I went to Walmart to have the tires installed (the tires were used on dirty). I wrote so many emails to Walmart to get a replacement on the tires because they were used. Walmart email responses were they were sorry for the inconvenience and they dropped the ball - yet nothing was done to replace the tires I got. Eventually all my emails fell on deaf ears. Do not buy these tires from Walmart."
730,44134,Jeanne Pugel,17/11/2020,Walmart,"Yesterday I went to Walmart to get a couple items. When I went to the register to check out, it rung up a lot more than I saw on the shelf. The cashier called a lady named ""Brenda"" to help. She was a great help! She took me to the shelf and then walked back to the register (I didn't have to wait in line again) and had her ring it up the shelf price. So nice of her to do that for me! I really appreciated all her effort to help. Thanks, Brenda"
731,36221,Paolo B.,17/11/2019,Amazon Go,"Amazon Go could be the future of shopping.  You scan your phone when you enter the store. You grab stuff that you want to purchase. And then you leave.  No checkout. No lines. No awkward conversations with cashiers.  Currently, there are five Amazon Go stores in Seattle, four in San Francisco, six in Chicago, and three in New York City.  The technology behind Amazon Go is both impressive and frightening. Sensors and hundreds of small cameras see everything happening in the store. Store shelves have weight sensors to detect which items a customer takes. If you pick an item off the shelf, put it back, and decide to purchase something else, Amazon's technology is able to track all of that. If you take an item off the shelf, it will be added to your virtual cart. Similarly, if you place an item back on the shelf, it is removed from your virtual cart. The store's machine learning and computer vision are impressive and state-of-the-art yet a little scary.  As far as prices, I think they are comparable to (or maybe a tad higher than) similar convenience stores. Space is limited so they don't have everything you'll find in a Safeway or a Fred Meyer.  There are at least two staff members at all times. One of them helps new customers get in. The other one is stationed at the liquor area. There must be a couple other staff members who restock supplies.  Aside from being a tourist attraction because it has pushed the boundaries of customer shopping experience, Amazon Go mostly benefits people who work nearby and are always on-the-go. The sandwiches and meals are decent, so I could see why somebody who's in a hurry would prefer to grab a quick bite from Amazon Go, and not from a restaurant where they have to wait in line to order and wait again for their food to arrive.  I was pleased with my experience at Amazon Go. Check it out! And when you do, don't forget to look at the ceiling! ;-)"

746,46350,Crystal Viglietta,18/11/2019,Walmart,"Ordered a bunk bed on November 6. Delivered on time on November 13. Only came with one of the 2 boxes. FedEx and Walmart shipping show only one box left the warehouse. I was told there may be another box on the way so to wait another 24 hours. Still no box. Call and the bed is now out of stock and the only thing they can do is refund the money which takes 5 days. So now after many calls and lots of wasted time. Now it is November 18th and I'm back on a bed hunt. I was told I would get a 20% discount if they couldn't find the box so I could order another bed that far more expensive from the second person I talked to but now they said it was only if I kept the half of a bed they sent, WHAT!!!!!!! Very frustrating. Be wary of ordering with Walmart, no customer service and don't seem to care about the customer's time, energy or money."

The wages are so wretchedly low that many of the child workers get up at 5:00 a.m. each morning to brush their teeth using just their finger and ashes from the fire, since they cannot afford a toothbrush or toothpaste."

If not, I would just go pick up from Target, since they are more organized. Walmart had the items in stock and would email me when they were ready. Well... 3 days later I'm still waiting.... Online it says they are delayed, whatever that means. I call the store and get a very bored employee that tells me to cancel the order and just come buy from the store. Well that defeats the purpose of online shopping and same day pick up. This is the second time I have been disappointed, and not worth saving the $5.75, difference in price."

755,44125,William Kauffman,18/11/2020,Walmart,Ordered a Celebrium gold plated class ring 12/13/19. Received 1/2/20. Wore a few times in the first 90 days. The stone fell out and had to be glued back in after wearing the ring 3-4 times. After 5-6 months of sporadic wear the gold plate has deteriorated and the black enamel has pealed off. Embarrassed to wear the ring now it looks so bad. After talking to Walmart numerous times they will not do anything about it. Even after I offered to pay the difference to upgrade to better quality ring. I would not recommend Walmart's rings and I will no longer shop there.

Twice without notifying me my order was canceled without notice due to being out of stock or not having anyone to deliver it. Which if that was the case why would the site let me order it? There was a minimum amount to make a purchase and limited delivery options of which I was willing to pay the higher cost to get what I wanted better nope wasn't good enough. F*** Wal Mart and I have been a live long customer but looks like.I need to learn about target and target.com.

I paid 50+ for a back pack on wheels at the beginning of school and one of the wheels came apart. Just came apart down to the ring it was made onto. Now don't call and ask to return anything, i have my reciept an there must be some kind of defect in the wheel cause the other one turned and looked fine. But this one no looks like the mold broke. So after much deliberation and talking to many different departments they tell me there is nothing they are going to do. So I went to my new best friend Amazon. Got her a better made one name brand and 20 dollars cheaper. So my friends. Tired of the hassle go to amazon got it in 2 days."

766,41990,Nicole Lawson,18/11/2021,Walmart,"The most horrible experience I have had with Walmart was on November 17, 2021. Although this was the worst experience it was not the first bad experience. My husband and I went to a Walmart in Ellicott city, Md., when we are checking out at the register the cashier ask if we want hags, I said yes. I told the usually the 5 cents is taken off when using a ebt card food stamps. It the bag charge was taken off twice before when I used an ebt card. Once my order was completed, the cashier said to me in a very nasty tone â€œyou owe me 5 cents. I asked the cashier why she said for the bag, I said oh I thought that it was taken off, the cashier said to me â€œyou canâ€™t eat the bagâ€. I ask her to repeat herself. Mind you I was going to pay the 5 cents, but after she acted like I was trying to personally cheat her out of a measly 5 cents, I kindly took everything out of my bag. The cashier was so nasty I could not believe what was going on about 5 cents. It was her tone and what she said. I didnâ€™t care about having to pay for a bag. But no one is going to talk down to me. I was polite to her, I deserved the same treatment. You would have thought she had stock in Walmart. Next time she might just eat the bag."

810,44094,Walmart sucks,19/11/2020,Walmart,"I signed in to my account and waited for the ps5 to restock which was at 3pm eastern time. Had it in my cart, tried checking out for 30-45 minutes. I then entered all of my shipping information. Then, after the shipping information was entered it said it was now out of stock. I will never buy anything from walmart, nor allow my family to buy there. This really sucked from waiting."
811,44095,Brian Rosenthal,19/11/2020,Walmart,you might get half the stuff you order. when you make an order dont expect it to be right.. I have made dozens of walmart online orders and out of those over 50% are incorrect. wrong size or just dont get the product at all.. Walmart is little to no help in correcting these. Hence pay the 99.00 and get amazon prime
812,44096,Colin Moore,19/11/2020,Walmart,I had the worst experience trying to purchase the PS5 today. I went on right at noon and got one in my cart. Spent the next 45 minutes getting through my order. Finally got to the complete purchase part and it would never except my order. Just said it was having issue completing my order and to refresh and try again in a moment. Never went through. I will never purchase anything from Walmart ever again. Now I have a kid that thought he was getting a PS5 not getting one now for X-mas. Awful website and awful customer service!
813,44097,D. Cullen Campbell,19/11/2020,Walmart,I went to buy an item online (PS5). I waited for an hour for it to get restocked. Once it opened up I was right there and placed the item in my cart. Due to Walmart issues stalling out. I could not get it purchased immediately. When the page finally loaded I got to the point were I issued my card and finalized my purchase. It then kicked me out and said it was out of stock. I placed the item in my cart 5 seconds after the site allowed a purchase. The whole thing took about 10 minutes. But due to their site I did not get my item. This was a Christmas present for my family. I know they don't care who buys the product but being denied due to their crap is very frustrating.

818,44103,Kegan Cundick,19/11/2020,Walmart,"Seriously screw walmart. I had it so on the website that I would be notified when the Xbox series x console would be in stock. I got an alert and it only said I could pick it up in store. So I took my lunch break to hurry over and pick it up.  I went in and first off, took me about 5 minutes to even find someone who could help me. Then I asked if they have any of the consoles were in stock, or in the back. They said no and that somehow the consoles in stock were mainly for online orders. The online orders were not a option if you were paying attention.  They basically blew me off and were not being understanding. I dont care if it was management corporate or whatever, why even bother telling me theyre in stock, when they are already reserved. How about you fix that so I don't waste my time going to your store.  Even if you do, I will not know, because I am sick and tired of dealing with Walmart and its employees. ðŸ–• Screw walmart and their employees."
819,44104,Richondo Fabiano,19/11/2020,Walmart,"Let's just all ban Walmart and buy from AMZN.....You can't even call and talk to someone. 2 million employees and they keep disconnecting my call.We had 4 computers with the fastest internet available on a 16 g-ram mac 27'. Two we started at 2:59:58. and two at 3:00. WE EVEN PRATICED IT! They were selling, what, 5 of them???...lol There's is no way that someone got in the order faster than me. No chance"
820,44105,Lee Wmr,19/11/2020,Walmart,i was online ordering a ps5 had it in my cart went to check out and got error message over and over then out of stock. worst experience ever. Now my kids xmas is screwed
821,44106,T Adams,19/11/2020,Walmart,"If you're going to release a time to purchase a ""hot"" item, please make sure your website can handle the traffic and make sure you have enough stock to last longer than 2 seconds! I had the ps5 in my cart and tried to pay for it...but for 10 minutes the system kept lagging and crashing and would not allow me to pay. When it finally let up, it brought me back to my cart and it was empty. Most websites let you grab the item and then give you 2 minutes to complete the payment process but because your website is not up to speed, it crashed several times within 2 minutes. Then after 20 times of clicking continue to try to move forward...it just took the item out of my cart and said item is out of stock. That is 10 minutes I will never get back, what a waste of time and serious effort. Walmart knows that they going to sell out of this item anyways, why not randomly put a few up for sale every hour...not announce a specific time so that your system crashes when 9 million people want to buy the quantity of 10 ps5's that you put for sale. What a horrible way to treat your customers in these horrific times.. Never again Walmart, do better...be better!"
822,44107,Dennis,19/11/2020,Walmart,"Walmart.com is the WORST! Logged on the site, added an item to my cart, started the check out process, then went to payment and got a screen that said they are busy, return to Walmart.com and start check out over. At that point the cart was empty and now out of stock. When I tried a chat session, it said to email or call. When I called, it said high volume call later That will be the LAST TIME I use walmart.com"
823,44108,Kyle,19/11/2020,Walmart,When you go to buy a system and the site crashes after it was already in your cart. Worse site on Earth.
824,44109,Fredrick Barry,19/11/2020,Walmart,"If Wal-Mart is going to advertise release times for limited stock products they really need to make sure that their website can handle the load. Letting customers keep randomly clicking to hope that their cart advances to checkout is not a smart way to treat customers, after having seen their website crash out repeatedly this holiday season (enough to make the news) Wal-Mart taking zero steps to address this problem just shows how little they actually care about the customer experience (if the 70+% bad reviews on this site didn't already give you that clue).  I personally, will make sure to give my business to other retailers this season that at least don't jerk their customers around and call it acceptable."

831,44116,Dissatisfied Customer,19/11/2020,Walmart,"On one order I received someone else's order entirely. Another order I received all of mine but part of someone else's. Today is the final straw. I placed my order this morning. Immediately I tried to change the time and day. The app was not functioning. Cust care was having the same prob. So I signed off work to be here for the delivery. After 45 minutes of the driver being late I find out he cancelled the delivery. Now it's been 2 hours with customer care. Edgar offered $10 credit but I've lost $##.## as of 9pm and I'm still counting. Agent said, ""Our stores are having issues with limited staffing and drivers these days which causes back-logs and delays"". THESE DAYS must have started months ago and never ended. Walmart has turned to crap"

There was one check stand open and I felt sorry for the checker. There was a line 12 people long and no one offered to open another check stand. What is wrong with Walmart customer service here at holiday time? We have always loved Walmart, but this was ridiculous. Many in line were complaining."
833,44119,Tim lee,19/11/2020,Walmart,you order an item gos to cart then says out of stock Walmart needs to update there site to not allow BOTS TO ORDER so people can get 40 ps5 or xbox n charged 1300 bucks
834,41982,Jeff Scott,19/11/2021,Walmart,"Do NOT order ANYTHING from Walmart.com! Once they have your money they couldnâ€™t care less if you are satisfied with your order. Received a damaged TV from them, followed the return/replace orders from them to a T. Fed Ex has returned the item to them. It has been a day and a half since Walmart received and signed for the TV. My tracking info from Walmart says â€œWaiting on receipt of itemâ€! Several calls to Walmart â€œCustomer Careâ€ result on me being told something different every time. The last thing I was told was that I should be receiving information about the return in 24 - 48 hrs. I asked if it would be 24 - 48 hrs from the time Walmart received and signed for the item or 24 - 48 hrs from the current phone call. Was told from the phone call. Unbelievable! Like I said, once they have your money, you are basically the dirt beneath their feet!"
835,41983,AL WOOD,19/11/2021,Walmart,when this program first started it was great. they have tinkered with it until it is no longer recognizing as a place of business. Ordering has become a confusing mess. The last order I received was someone elses order which means that two people had screw up orders. They replace items that they do no have in stock without discussing with the purchaser. In other words this program as it is now is a complete failure.
836,41984,Eric,19/11/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a gift from Walmart Online and paid $35 for the expedited 2-day shipping option (worth more than the gift). Kept getting new delivery delay notifications from Canada post and it is now 11 days past the initial delivery date. Contacted Walmart and they had no clue where the package was. Customer service at Walmart was polite but kept parroting that I needed to contact a third party supplier (WFC Solutions Crop.) to find out where my package is, and zero offer to reimburse my shipping ASAP, despite mutual agreement that the package delivery was very late. So I did their job for them and found out that the package is still sitting in the original Canada Post office in Ontario. I have had delays in express shipping from eBay and Amazon (common in Canada), but with those companies I could open a quick online chat, explain the delay, and always had my delivery charges reimbursed. Not with Walmart, they have no clue about helping their customers and do not seem to care that they are being killed by their competitors with online shopping. Won't be shopping with them ever again. Too much incompetence and hassle. Go with Amazon."

I CALL BACK MONDAY- NO ANSWER AND I TALK TO A DIFFERENT DEPT THEY SAID THEY ARE ACTUALLY OPEN TODAY HOWEVER THEY ARE ABOUT TO GO TO LUNCH, JUST SWING IN AND TALK TO THEM IN AN HOUR. THEY ONLY HAVE 3 TIRES THAT ARRIVED. THEY TRACK THE TIRE AND SAY ITS LOST 8 STATES AWAY FROM ME. THEY CAN'T GET ONE FROM ANOTHER LOCATION. I HAVE TO FEND FOR MYSELF TO CALL CORPORATE TO GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT. I CALL CORPORTATE AND THEY SAY WHY ARE YOU CALLING US. TALK TO YOUR LOCAL WALMART. IF THEY WON'T HELP CALL BACK ANOTHER DAY. LOCAL WALMART TRIES TO HELP HOWEVER ONCE AGAIN TOLD TO TALK TO CORPORATE...Are you not the same company????Anyways talk to a few people in corporate and then they ask why are you trying to get a refund for your tire. For the millionth time its because I don't have it and its now winter while driving my vehicle with the spare on it. This process has been almost been a month long ordeal. Not happy and haven't received any goodwill. I'll gladly pay a little extra for a local shop to complete the job next time. My mistake for giving this a try. SAFE YOURSELF THE headache!"
838,41986,Abbey,19/11/2021,Walmart,"I've tried ordering holiday gifts 2 different times now, 2 seperate years, and each time a joke. 1st attempt my order never got processed or shipped, and lost in limbo. That order had to be cancelled and refunded. This time I'm still waiting for packages with arrival dates that keep extending. One item was delivered to a address in a completely different county than label stated. Replaced item that was due to arrive in 2 days, is now delayed untill next week!?. One item in the order has been cancelled because it hasn't even been shipped. I paid for 2-3 day shipping on this order and it's been 14 days with only 1 item out of 4 delivered to me, 1 item out of 4 delivered to a strangers address in another county, 1 item cancelled and 2 out of 4 "" in transit"". Ridiculous to say the least. They use USPS and FedEx carriers. I love Walmart, but have now learned to hate their carrier services. In-store pickup from now on only for me."

The very next message tells me, we apologize but there was a problem with your order. I have never once had these problems with my orders from Amazon, Amazon ships the day after they get my order, they are not still messaging me after five days of ordering.I will never again give Walmart.com another chance to make shopping overly stressful! Now please excuse me while I go call them for the fourth time since I ordered, Christmas is coming,I need to know now what I still need to order from anywhere else but Walmart."

They had charged me twice. I called and was passed from one foreigner to another. Said they had cancelled it. They didn't refund my money and 2 roku's arrived a few days later. Took them to Walmart and asked for manager who passed me on to a customer service person who contacted Walmart.com. Another foreigner! Told me to return it myself to a third party and that party would refund my money. Who knows if I will ever get my $98 but I will never order from WALMART AGAIN! Have never had such problems with Amazon so I will stay with them.

I sent her 1000 dollars and when she got to Walmart by Uber, they did not give her the money as they only can deliver up to $500 dollars.

849,46022,Becki Snyder,20/11/2019,Walmart,"On 9/27, I ordered a Fram air filter for my car from Walmart.com. I received a Barbie doll instead of the air filter I ordered. I contacted Walmart.com Customer Care & advised the ""expert"" of the situation. A ""replacement"" part was ordered, & I was given instructions to take the doll to a local Walmart store. This seemed unusual, so I questioned these instructions. The CS agent again advised to take the doll to a local store. I followed these instructions, & did finally receive the correct item, on 10/9. I also received $1.57 refund for my troubles. On 11/7, I received an email from Walmart.com advising that they had not yet received the incorrect item their employee picked & sent to me in error, & provided a shipping label, 1 month after calling Customer Care regarding receipt of the wrong item. Another email was sent from Walmart.com on 11/12, to which I contacted Customer Care & explained that I had received these emails, & to advise the wrong item was taken to a local store. This ""expert"" advised they were processing a full refund for the purchase price ($33.51) of the filter, but would take 5 business days to receive the refund in my account. After my call, Walmart proceeded to take $31.94 from my account for the purchase price of the air filter, minus the refund for my ""troubles"", claiming that they were taking this money because I had not returned the Barbie doll. Walmart took money out of my account without my consent. I have now paid twice for 1 Fram air filter. Yet another call to Customer Care, another ""promise"" of my money being returned within 5 business days. It is now day 5....neither amount has been posted to my account. What a nightmare!!! Too many errors....now they're stealing from their customers. Like they need the money. DO NOT ORDER FROM WALMART.COM. THEY DO NOTHING BUT SCREW UP & STEAL YOUR MONEY."

They had charged me twice. I called and was passed from one foreigner to another. Said they had cancelled it. They didn't refund my money and 2 roku's arrived a few days later. Took them to Walmart and asked for manager who passed me on to a customer service person who contacted Walmart.com. Another foreigner! Told me to return it myself to a third party and that party would refund my money. Who knows if I will ever get my $98 but I will never order from WALMART AGAIN!

886,46179,Shirley Stoddard Davis,20/11/2019,Walmart,BUYER BEWARE! Will never order from WALMART.COM again. Ordered 1 Roku ($49) on line. Checked my bank account 2 hours later. They had charged me twice. I called and was passed from one foreigner to another. Said they had cancelled it. They didn't refund my money and 2 roku's arrived a few days later. Took them to Walmart and asked for manager who passed me on to a customer service person who contacted Walmart.com. Another foreigner! Told me to return it myself to a third party and that party would refund my money. Who knows if I will ever get my $98 but I will never order from WALMART AGAIN! Have never had such problems with Amazon so I will stay with them.

This seemed unusual, so I questioned these instructions. The CS agent again advised to take the doll to a local store. I followed these instructions, & did finally receive the correct item, on 10/9.

On 11/7, I received an email from Walmart.com advising that they had not yet received the incorrect item their employee picked & sent to me in error, & provided a shipping label, 1 month after calling Customer Care regarding receipt of the wrong item. Another email was sent from Walmart.com on 11/12, to which I contacted Customer Care & explained that I had received these emails, & to advise the wrong item was taken to a local store. This ""expert"" advised they were processing a full refund for the purchase price ($33.51) of the filter, but would take 5 business days to receive the refund in my account. After my call, Walmart proceeded to take $31.94 from my account for the purchase price of the air filter, minus the refund for my ""troubles"", claiming that they were taking this money because I had not returned the Barbie doll. Walmart took money out of my account without my consent. I have now paid twice for 1 Fram air filter.

I contacted Walmart.com Customer Care & advised the ""expert"" of the situation. A ""replacement"" part was ordered, & I was given instructions to take the doll to a local Walmart store. This seemed unusual, so I questioned these instructions. The CS agent again advised to take the doll to a local store. I followed these instructions, & did finally receive the correct item, on 10/9. I also received $1.57 refund for my troubles. On 11/7, I received an email from Walmart.com advising that they had not yet received the incorrect item their employee picked & sent to me in error, & provided a shipping label, 1 month after calling Customer Care regarding receipt of the wrong item. Another email was sent from Walmart.com on 11/12, to which I contacted Customer Care & explained that I had received these emails, & to advise the wrong item was taken to a local store. This ""expert"" advised they were processing a full refund for the purchase price ($33.51) of the filter, but would take 5 business days to receive the refund in my account. After my call, Walmart proceeded to take $31.94 from my account for the purchase price of the air filter, minus the refund for my ""troubles"", claiming that they were taking this money because I had not returned the Barbie doll. Walmart took money out of my account without my consent. I have now paid twice for 1 Fram air filter. Yet another call to Customer Care, another ""promise"" of my money being returned within 5 business days. It is now day 5....neither amount has been posted to my account. What a nightmare!!! Too many errors....now they're stealing from their customers. Like they need the money. DO NOT ORDER FROM WALMART.COM. THEY DO NOTHING BUT SCREW UP & STEAL YOUR MONEY."

926,46339,Shirley Stoddard Davis,20/11/2019,Walmart,BUYER BEWARE! Will never order from WALMART.COM again. Ordered 1 Roku ($49) on line. Checked my bank account 2 hours later. They had charged me twice. I called and was passed from one foreigner to another. Said they had cancelled it. They didn't refund my money and 2 roku's arrived a few days later. Took them to Walmart and asked for manager who passed me on to a customer service person who contacted Walmart.com. Another foreigner! Told me to return it myself to a third party and that party would refund my money. Who knows if I will ever get my $98 but I will never order from WALMART AGAIN! Have never had such problems with Amazon so I will stay with them.

And once i tried to make payments, its said credit card expiry so i went and updated with the new card , until no purchase can be made. So i took the time to call them and they could literally not help and kept saying you should call your bank..i made over 3000$ of purchase this week alone!!!! Also they kept apologizing for nothing. I shall never ever buy from walmart again! Thank you for your previous purchases!"

They said that it can be to any Walmart up to $2500.00. Well that is not the case. Some Walmarts have restrictions on how much money they can delivered. I sent her 1000 dollars and when she got to Walmart by Uber, they did not give her the money as they only can deliver up to $500 dollars. My sister had to walk home empty handed because she had mo more money. If I would know this information, I would had split the transaction in two so she did not have any problem picking the much needed money."

930,44081,Trusting Transportation,20/11/2020,Walmart,"I had a Flu shot on September 30th and today is now 11/20/2020 and my shoulder still gives me a lot of pay. I contacted Walmart customer service and they had the Manager over the Pharmacy contact me only she wouldn't let me get a word in. Very unhelpful! She kept saying I wonder how I can make this up to you! And yet she never did!  Knowing how shots are given I knew something the Pharmacist failed to do was going to cause problems and it has. The manager didn't know the process and to defend her pharmacist she resulted in lying.  She mentioned that they have an option of needle sizes, the flu shot is only in your arm and they do not have to squeeze your shoulder unless they choose to. Everyone sane and families know that the flu shots are in your shoulder, the should do have to be squeezed and the size of the needle depends on the size of the person. Example: Needles used for adults are never the same for babies.   Unfortunately, I had to go to another Pharmacy-only this time at Target and exactly what I thought, this Pharmacist said the same thing.  Since FLU Shots are normally given in the shoulder and since this Pharmacist failed to squeeze my shoulder, the needle may have gone in too far and hit the bone!  I received a call from the Store Manager and he didn't do anything either. He also never contacted me back after speaking to someone in Wellness.  I AM NOW SURE THAT I WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER FLU SHOT AND IF I EVER BECOME THAT DUMB AGAIN, MY SHOT WILL NOT COME FROM WALMART! My doctor's appointment is December 3rd and hospitals are not a place for me to be at the moment.  I am not shocked at how Walmart handled this news! I am shocked that they couldn't come to a resolution.  Maybe if I contact the Medical or pharmacy board, they will find a solution for me. I should not be in pain each time I roll on my side in my sleep. It shouldn't hurt raising my arm and shouldn't be painful to put on clothing."
931,44082,Rui Maluf Filho,20/11/2020,Walmart,"Tried to buy the PS5 there when it released on Nov.12, I was on the site 5 min before the release time they had, the first time I couldn't even add it to my car (ok that happens) however the next 3 times I added it to my cart but when I went to checkout it kept me in a waiting room, after waiting 15min each time it would tell me that it was sold out. Later I found out it was because they did not want to protect against bots buying hundreds of PS5s because walmart is more intent on making a profit than making their customers happy (it is simple to prevent this, and they even use tools to prevent that when you try to write a review for a product). After that they had another batch coming out on the 19th I think, needless to say, the same thing happened. This is ridiculous and I decided I will never shop again at walmart and I will tell as many people as I can about this. Honestly walmart F YOU!!!"
932,44083,mark justice,20/11/2020,Walmart,Put a hold on my card after I cancelled a order no less than five minutes I placed it. Now have to wait up to a week to see it back on my card. They lied and said it was on my banks end not theirs. Attempted to make me jump thru hoops ie pass the buck. Will never do business online with them again.

Not to mention limited supply which under the circumstances I get but still the order was wrong and now I have to wait to get one. The only reason I created a Walmart account was because of the ps5 but Walmart let me down. I will never recommend using Walmart online and now I donâ€™t even want to go to their store. Very disappointed. Now Iâ€™m going to go to target, GameStop, or Best Buy."

935,44086,Amber Lynn,20/11/2020,Walmart,"WOULD GIVE ZERO STARS IF I COULD. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE! I accidentally ordered 3 of the same thing online on 11.13.20, well, I was able to get to the first one on time and push ""refund"" so that it wouldnt go through but the second one, I didnt get to in time. The second one showed ""pending return"" and then gave me a barcode to give to a Walmart Associate (as it said); so what do i do, I go to Walmart and show them my Walmart App and that it says to give this ""barcode"" to them. I saw the barcode thing on 11.14.20 but I didnt end up going to Walmart till yesterday (11.19.20), as this was the day I got my order delivered and I had to go to Walmart anyways. So, when I was at Walmart on 11.19.20, I ended up having 3 people help me because they had no idea what is was that was going on with the ""pending return"". So, the Walmart associate stated a Chat with Walmart on my phone app and was talking with a Sham (Chat # 20119-82664-2008-0000 / 5:14PM on 11.19.20) and he didnt help at all. All he kept talking about was the one that got delivered to me. Which she told him, yes, i got one delivered but they charged me twice on my account (which i noticed that morning, so i thought the going to walmart because of the ""pending return"" would refund that money but that wasnt the case at all). So, we finally get him to talk about the pending return and he states, I need to return the item and then I will get a refund. This is when i started to get angry because I didnt have that second item delivered in the first place. This is when he states that the item is actually being delivered. At this point, I was sure this guy had no idea what he was talking about. The Walmart associate then stated on the chat that it only said the pending return, there was no, delivered, pending delivery, processing or tracking number or anything like that. So we asked him for the tracking number, as I was not going to end the chat without one, I needed proof that this item was actually coming my way since I paid for it. He then sent it to me and then ended the chat without us saying anything much after that; the Walmart associate was shocked when he did that (seemed sketchy). We looked at the tracking number, it was the exact same as the one i already got delivered to me. Then we noticed that on the app, it didnt say ""pending return"" anymore, it stated ""DELIVERED"". Like whaaaaaat!!!! Its like they charged me for two items but put everything on one order. At this point, I was pissed. By the way, its the next day and I still havent received this supposedly delivered 2nd item. Hmmmmm..... So the walmart associate had me call 1-800-WALMART. This guy was amazing along with the Walmart Associate that helped me at the sore. I wish i remembered her name but Jose was the guy on the phone. He sent me a refund. This morning, i noticed I was charged again; I was charged now, 3 times for 1 item. I will never order online again. I did get get a refund for that extra charge but I had to beg and cry for it. Never ordering online again!! First and last time."

Nov 8, received confirmed order for tires, and installation scheduled for Nov 11. Nov 10, receved email stating my order cancelled. Checked Walmart.com on my order. I was asked to re-order. Why re-order once confirmed??? Re-order showed separate orders, not for a set of 4 tires. Is it a norm to re-ordering once confirmed?? Called Walmart Naples auto center numerous times on separate occassions, they never responded."
938,44089,Dave Hasslehaas,20/11/2020,Walmart,This website is GARBAGE! Worst online experience ever. They can't get their inventory right and it results in extreme frustration for the shopper. NEVER EVER BUY from this pathetic website.
939,44090,Jennifer Davis,20/11/2020,Walmart,"I would not recommend shopping at Walmart.com to anyone I know. Not even an enemy. Itâ€™s just not worth the headache! On October 9th I ordered a bed frame and a mattress. I received the bed frame, no problem. When it came to my mattress, they sent me a baby crib instead. I have no children. I have no need for a crib. Now Iâ€™ve spoken to about 10 different people all of whom had different accents most of which I could not understand. All of the customer service agents tell you everything that you want to hear but do nothing to actually help the situation. Although they make you think it is all taken care of until itâ€™s been over a month of frustration. I finally canceled my order and now Iâ€™m fighting to get my refund. Iâ€™ve spoken to 3 â€œhigher upsâ€ non of which are helpful in getting my refund. Because instead of refunding the item that I never got they refunded me the item I did receive, probably because it was less expensive. So now Iâ€™m waiting to hear back from someone in billing accounts. I swear I HATE THIS COMPANY AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE! Greed has taken over our society and has put humanitarianism as a last resort. I will never shop at their stores nor will I ever buy any product from their on line store. This should not be that difficult. It doesnâ€™t help that everyone is a third party someone and no one knows whatâ€™s going on. I would like my full refund of the item I NEVER RECEIVED if I could put a quarter star I would but even that is giving too much credit!"

943,44117,Adam Gray,20/11/2020,Walmart,"Overcharged me on a laptop by $151. Then when i went to customer support the ""team lead"" who got upset with me while I was calm about it went online and changed the price right in front of me and acted like nothing happened. I even have screenshots from before and after. Contacted corporate. Will update this shortly. Pending what happens at the store. Store manager called me and is in the works of possibly resolving this.  (Update) Overall the assistant manager and manager at the store at the time actually resolved the issue. The laptop purchased was the same item number for the black friday deal so they refunded the over payment since it was clearly in stock when I purchased it. They did good. 4 star could be warranted since the trouble I went through however with the ending treatment from the management i believe a 5 star is warranted considering black friday does make it super busy and mistakes can be made. 5 star earned since they proved why walmart has earned its right to be on top in the industry."

No thank you, why would I give Walmart more of my money? ðŸ¤¦. I asked for the corporate number and the guy gave me a number that said ""Walmart Deli."" That is unacceptable. My guess, Walmart purchased the item from a 3rd party seller and won't refund my money until they get a refund from them. I tried calling the electronic payment hotline (479) 277-2643 but they are only operating M-F from 8am- 3:30 pm. This is bad business. I will not be purchasing items from Walmart online ever again."

Was supposed to arrive tomorrow, they sent me a cancellation notice last night at 7pm for the first order.  Thanks Walmart..took more than a day to cancel.  They told me there is a â€œpayment processing problemâ€  I have already spoken to my loser bank (Chase) and made sure this charge went through...nope, not with Wal-mart.com.  I placed the order again after confirming with my card (Chase, loser bank). That the charge would go through after them (Chase) sending me 3 fraud notice emails following my first order.  Between Walmart and Chase, I have given up. I wonâ€™t be using Chase credit anymore, but wal-mart was worse.  I have perfect credit, this is a joke. Chase, every time I leave town they cut off my credit card. Wal-mart, even after speaking to customer service I just got tired of wasting my time, they were incompetent,  Wal-mart now wonâ€™t process any order They have horrible non existent customer service in the Philippines. Useless.  I would have just used another card but they made it almost impossible for me to log in and order again.  Never mind wal mart, Amazon just got a sale that should have been yours if your website payment processing were the least bit competent, or your customer service, but alas, neither are worth the waste of time you will experience.

I placed the order again after confirming with my card (Chase, loser bank). That the charge would go through after them (Chase) sending me 3 fraud notice emails following my first order.  Between Walmart and Chase, I have given up. I wonâ€™t be using Chase credit anymore, but wal-mart was worse.  I have perfect credit, this is a joke. Chase, every time I leave town they cut off my credit card. Wal-mart, even after speaking to customer service I just got tired of wasting my time, they were incompetent,  Wal-mart now wonâ€™t process any order They have horrible non existent customer service in the Philippines. Useless.  I would have just used another card but they made it almost impossible for me to log in and order again.

1077,44080,Cory Rutt,21/11/2020,Walmart,"On 11/20/20 my fiancÃ© has placed an order for pick up( it was the only option) for a camera for our son for Christmas. The order was placed between 9-10 am and the order details said the item would be ready by 8 pm. She ha to run out for errands and stopped by the Walmart to see if the order was ready. This was at approximately 630 pm. She had to speak to a manager about her order. The manager told her they were 800+ orders behind and the item was not prepared. My fiancÃ© offered to go get the item from the shelf. She was told she could but would have to pay for the item again. As she looked for the item, the item was no longer in the store. Now I have paid for the camera and there was no more in stock. I talked to customer service when she told me all of this and there is nothing they could do. They cancelled the order after I was told to get a hold of Walmart.com so we could just get the item shipped to my house. Now I have to wait to get my money back and I canâ€™t get the item I have to find it somewhere else because the store is behind and Walmart.com and the stores are two separate entities. This chain needs to get shut down for doing horrible business and treating people like garbage. Oh after my third time actually talking to someone from customer service they offered $10 for my inconvenience. WHAT A JOKE! This company is."

1080,41976,Christine Hanagan,21/11/2021,Walmart,"Item advertised as being in stock was unavailable when I arrivd at store. Clerk said there were four there in the database but they were ""on hold"". The young woman in Customer Service claimed to be the store manager in charge at the time. She was processing returns. She said she did not know what ""on hold"" meant, was unconcerned and did not assist me at all."
1081,41977,Erica,21/11/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a PlayStation 5 at a cost of over $1,000 as an Xmas present on Walmartâ€™s website. I didnâ€™t initially realize I was purchasing from a third party. When I received my package from the seller, Supply Experts Wholesale, Inc., it was a Fed Ex envelope that contained nothing but a packing slip. No $1,000 console. NOTHING. Walmart referred us to the seller for resolution, but the seller never responded. When that happened, we notified Walmart, who again insisted we try to engage with the seller. Rather than get the run around again, I disputed with the credit card company. It was a much quicker solution. Just be aware that Walmartâ€™s online seller guarantee is bunk. They wonâ€™t help you, and if you ever manage - somehow- to get your money back from them, it will have been a Herculean task. The whole reason third party sellers seek placement under the imprimatur of online retailers like Amazon and Walmart is because they are able to ride on the consumer trust coattails of those mega retailers. But when those retailers do nothing to ensure the integrity of those third part sellers, itâ€™s the customer who ends up holding the bag. A search of the internet revealed this particular third party seller had been ripping off numerous customers for well over a year on Walmartâ€™s website. Yet they are still allowed to sell. Shame on the third party seller, of course, but shame on Walmart for doing nothing to shield customers who buy items under the Walmart umbrella. Walmart.com is basically providing a platform for scammers to reach untold numbers of online shoppers. Itâ€™s bad business and an act of bad faith on Walmartâ€™s part."

I am calling the store and I am waiting already for 20 mins and nobody answer. So disappointed. I use Walmart since 13 years ago, but the last 4â€™years are being a nightmare to go there. I think is time for a chance. Not use their services anymore."

1121,44074,Ramsay,22/11/2020,Walmart,Terrifying experience. My order is not processed for many days
1122,44075,Catherine Phillips,22/11/2020,Walmart,"Terrible. Six months to a year ago, I would have given walmart.com ten stars. not now. impossible. I wanted to order 15 items for shipping. I did not care if they were shipped next day or two day or two weeks. Some items did not qualify for shipping such as brown sugar which is odd because it is a dry good, not a liquid. Some items were next day shipping and some were two day shpping. Instead of being able to place one order for all of the items, I had to 'save' the two day shipping items, then place the order for only items that were next day. then go back in and place an order for only items that were two days. Seriously? If I order from Amazon or Barnes and Noble, I place one order regardless of the length of time to ship. So, in splitting the order, 1) it was a sheer hassle, 2) I did not qualify for free shipping on the second order 3) my credit card company thought it was a fraud. Months ago, walmart.com was the easiest online site to use on the web. Clean, simple, clear and customer friendly. Not now."

You have to have Prime, and must download the Amazon Go app before entering, or you can let a friend/family member in with you if they donâ€™t have an account, but anything that they walk out with will be billed to you also! They had a few mugs and bags, but was mostly organic soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts. They all appeared to be made on site as the kitchen area was the biggest part of this store. About 5 minutes after you leave, you get an itemized receipt via email."
1124,41968,Charlie,22/11/2021,Walmart,"I was in the Walmart in East Brunswick NJ today. I was looking at a vegetable platter and there was no price on it or no label on the shelf it was on . I remembered that the store had scanners around the store to check prices. I walked around the store and could not find one. I asked an employee that was walking by and asked where they were. She said they do not have them anymore, and you have to get a Walmart app and scan it with your cell phone. Finally I found someone to scan my item . They need to put price scanners back in the store. People do not want to be bothered with an app. I would have just put the vegetable platter on the shelf and went home. Please put scanners back in your stores. Thank you"
1125,41969,Barbara Tynan Cameron,22/11/2021,Walmart,"I purchased Walmart+ to get early access to their black Friday sales. Twice I went in right at the time the PS5 went on sale and they were ""sold out"". This was right at 3PM and 4PM. They are selling a product to help you get hard to find items, when they don't have the items. Or not a very large quantity of them."
1126,41970,Josh S,22/11/2021,Walmart,"I tried to order a PS5 game console on 11/22/2021. I was online at exactly 2pm MST and was put into a virtual online queue for 18mins. When my time to came tp purchase a PS5 I put it in my cart, put in my shipping and credit card info, clicked submit and was told that the item was out of stock at 2:20pm. Totally feels like false advertising on Walmart's end and I am very frustrated that they are able to offer ""deals"" that sell out in the first 20mins of going live. Complete BS on the Walmart+ membership I bought to access this deal. Don't believe their garbage claims of ""black Friday deals"" because they're total BS and only available for like 5mins."
1127,41971,Donovan Perez,22/11/2021,Walmart,Imagine making the worse thing you can possibly make then make it about 100x worse and you have the Walmart website. Some how they made it to where if you got the console and it says you have 10 minutes to get it you really don't have it and instead waste 10 minutes of your life
1128,41972,David Rodriguez,22/11/2021,Walmart,So I ordered online and Walmart ended up sending it to my old address that I have a live that in two years and now Iâ€™m out of the products canâ€™t get the product and they donâ€™t want to refund my money and theyâ€™re saying is my fault but I put my new address and everything and theyâ€™re still donâ€™t wanna take responsibility
1129,41973,Matthew Jones,22/11/2021,Walmart,"No Customer Service When Account Hacked.  Account was recently hacked and order placed using my saved card. This took place at 6:30 AM. By 10:00 AM I noticed the transaction and contacted Walmart customer service to notify of the fraud and cancel the order. I was told the order was canceled and fraud team alerted. 8 hours later at 4:52 PM part of the order still shipped and later at 9:18 PM an additional part of the order shipped. Then items were delivered the following day by 12:24 PM. After speaking again with two other customer service reps I was informed there was nothing more they could do but still ""Escalate"" the issue to the Fraud team and that I would have to dispute the charges with my bank. For 3 days now they have been holding a pending transaction for the entire amount of the fraudulent order, and now additional pending charges for items shipped and delivered. I get no where with Walmart when they had plenty of time to cancel the entire transaction and stop any of the items from shipping. It is a shame as I am sure this happens more often and they refuse to stop portions of orders from shipping."
1130,41974,amanda milam,22/11/2021,Walmart,Let me start off by saying Walmart customer service is an idiot. They really need to hire English speaking knowledgeable people. I ordered a microwave a month ago because mine broke when I got the new microwave that one was damaged and broke as well. So I contacted Walmart and they issued a replacement. When the replacement arrived I plugged it up and kept it. Now I sent the broken one back to Walmart through ups. A few days later after receiving the replacement microwave I got another brand new one and Walmart said they were going to charge me for it but I told them that they sent it to me by mistake so I would send it back. Now they have done issued me several refunds charged me for a microwave that they claim they never received back then sent out for a refund for my electric shaver that I didnâ€™t even request for. I will never ordered anything from Walmart again

1166,44069,Berdette Dorceus,23/11/2020,Walmart,"Walmart is so horrible! Walmart has return policies which are 30 days on electronics with receipts, and 90 days on other items without receipt, and store credit without receipt, but it is cover up, they donâ€™t seem happy when you return something, they start to give you faces. I went to Walmart to return some products, they cashier gave a little piece of paper as a warning and told me I cannot return any items to Walmart any more more. I donâ€™t just get it! That paper the lady gave has a customer service number in it, I called them and explained that event to a woman, she told that could not see why they gave that warning. That woman also explained me that Walmart doesnâ€™t like when return products every month, that makes me believe that Walmartâ€™s return policy is a mockery, I will stop shopping there. I buy items for my money and you dare to tell me I canâ€™t return them and I have a limit, what is that supposed to mean? I can not believe a shop like Walmart has very bad customer service like that, a place that has thousands of people coming in to buy your products and you are so horrible, if you lucky to find one nice person at Walmart and you are not going to find two! I donâ€™t want anyone to give me faces for my money when I return something. What kind of customer satisfaction policy you posted there if you do not really want people to return things, Walmart?"
1167,44070,Tim Palmgren,23/11/2020,Walmart,"Just cancelled my Walmart+ account! I placed an express order today and the driver was at my door with the items when he got a text message to return the order to the store! That's ridiculous! Customer service said the order was out of the freezer too long that's why it was called back! I call BS! The store is 3.5 miles away and he was at my door when he got the text to return the order. WHY DID THEY LET HIM LEAVE WITH IT?  The email cancellation that I received from Walmart doesn't say anything about being out of the freezer too long, it says it was cancelled because of ""Unusually high demand. Slot availability, staffing, and inventory are still fluctuating daily""! Don't know why they couldn't have had the driver return and exchange the frozen items instead of cancelling the whole order!  On another occasion, I ordered for delivery on a Friday afternoon and when they missed the delivery window, they just delivered it at 9am Saturday morning without any warning! Very disappointed! I guess it's back to Instacart and my personal shopper from now on! SMDH"

1170,41961,jim w,23/11/2021,Walmart,"Please take these comments seriously as I just went for price. What else can be said when youre waiting for a purchase and upon arrival, it doesnt work??? I guess when you're on a budget and purchase refurbished, aggravation is part of the deal. Took delivery of a refurbed $200 TV, that didnâ€™t work. At this point it makes sense to take TCL out of the equation except for the fact that their TV was returned originally. Iâ€™m willing to bet the mfr warranty has probably expired on most of these TVâ€™s thatâ€™s why Walmart has nothing stated next to â€œWarrantyâ€. Thereâ€™s a whole racket of refurbished TVâ€™s Walmart deals with at their return center in Indianapolis and theres a co named GoTRG at same location w/ them apparently refurbing them. Obviously, getting the refurb correct and creating a happy customer is not #1 on Walmart's list. Check out GoTRG.com and see how big this return business is."

Got confirmation that my $49.80 total toy was confirmed and on its way. 4 days later said delivered but no it wasn't, called they said it was lost they had to issue me a credit and I had to reorder, when I went to do that the price was $79 total, I calledvthem they walked me through the order and supervisor adjusted price. Get a conf. # all good, but 10 mins. later an email they canceled the order for unusual activity. Call again supervisor says I will send you a discount code to order again and put the code in to correct price, then phone disconnects UGH. I go to order again no place to put code, call again am told the code is no good for this item, and I can order something else and use it I DONT WANT ANYTHING ELSE, phone disconnects again, call back again ask why they just don't adjust like the order they cancelled? Told me to order and though it would charge me the $79 they would send it out to be adjusted.Never got adjusted, called again and said oh we can't adjust you didn't order from Walmart.com WHAT??? Of course I did! Then I'm told to look at bottom of order they ran out of product for original price now was ordered from 3rd party vendor and the $79 price is their price nothing they can do. What a scam Walmart will never get my business again. And yes I tried to contact Walmart Corp. in Bentonville Arkansas, only to always get reps only based out of the USA."

I have literally chatted SIX times with them and they say ""I deeply apologize, you will receive a refund email in 24 hours"" and of course nothing happens. Order# 5652158827800 , all this trouble for $36. Customer service is a joke."
1174,41965,Shannen,23/11/2021,Walmart,"The most bad customer service of the world. When you based on the Walmart policy asking the information about a price match. Instead of giving explanation, they directly asked you to cancel the order and go to other companies."

I placed the order online and PAID in full for the item. The morning I was getting ready to drive to the location, I got am email stating a substitution had been made and I would not be getting what I ordered. I have called 3 times asking for a status of my refund. One dingberry customer service representative told me I would need to return the item to the store to get a refund, but I never picked up the item since it was NOT what I ordered. It's been over a week and no refund. I am now in the process of requesting a charge back with my credit card company, but it could take up to 90 days. It is an expensive item and a lot of money to lose."

1198,36270,Jessica B.,24/11/2018,Amazon Go,"seattleeatsblog.com/blogâ€¦ for all my pictures and videos inside Amazon Go!  Amazon Go opened on Monday, so as soon as I clocked, I walked down to Amazon Go and got in line. Yes, I waited in line to go to the new grocery store where there are no checkout lines. The irony is not lost on me. But then again, this is Seattle, and we own our lines and waiting in them is a badge of honor for us. Especially if it's raining. And also, it was opening day of this brand-new technology, and everyone wanted to check it out.   As the new ""just walk out"" grocery store, there are no checkout lines. ""Computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning"" allow the store to automatically track when you pick up and put back items, then when you've finished shopping, you can just head on your way, no checkout required. Your Amazon account will be charged for whatever you walk out with.   First off, I've seen a few misconceptions about Amazon Go floating around, so touching on them seems to be a good place to start.   Real people do actually work there, and there are zero robots. There's an entire kitchen team whipping up the ready-to-eat salads and sandwiches, doormen to answer questions and give out free Amazon Go reusable shopping bags, and guys stocking the shelves. There are at least a couple people near the doors, to help people get scanned in if they're having technical difficulties. And a guy standing by the liquor who'll card you and keep kids from grabbing it. It's just that they aren't working as cashiers.  It's not really replacing your grocery store. Or mine; at least not in this iteration. It's a convenience store, but upgraded. There are bottled and canned drinks, snacks and chocolates, sandwiches and salads, liquor, take-and-make boxed dinners (very similar to something like Hello Fresh), a few household and pantry staples like toilet paper and ramen (that's a staple I promise), and a tiny little bit of fresh meats. There are quite a few local Seattle products available, like Theo's Chocolates and Tim's chips. But there are no aisles, no rows of fresh produce. And it's not very big at 1,800 square feet. It's designed for quick trips.   The Amazon Go app provides a QR code that you scan to enter the store and start your shopping session. The gates look a lot like subway terminal or theme park gates, and they open up when you scan your code. The app itself links up to your Amazon account, and you can choose your payment method from the ones listed there.  If your phone is dead when you get there, they have chargers available so you can quickly power-up and scan yourself in.  Once inside, the world is your oyster. I tested out picking up several different items, walking around with them, and then putting them back. We'll pretend it was for research and not because I'm indecisive.  If you need spot to microwave and nosh on whatever you just picked up, Amazon has you covered. There's a small seating area with microwaves, napkins, plasticware, and most importantly: hot sauce packets, free wifi, and charging stations.  I won't lie, it was a bit awkward to ""just walk out."" It does feel a little like you're shoplifting the first time you go. Everyone I saw there was just as awkward and hesitant to leave. We've spent our whole lives being told we're not allowed to take things from stores, and it's probably going to take some getting used to.   The only real danger I see is the same one that's been around for a while with credit cards: people over-buying because it doesn't feel like you're actually spending your money.  But rest assured, you are. A few minutes after I left the store, I got a notification showing me the items the store claimed were in my bag when I left. I had the opportunity to remove items from the receipt that I felt I was charged for incorrectly, but there were none. All of those things I'd picked up and walked around with and put back did get removed from my virtual cart.  Fun fact: it also tells you how long your shopping trip was. I clocked in at 10 minutes and 9 seconds, most of which was walking around taking pictures and seeing what was available.   Right around an hour after I approved of my cart, I got the email receipt showing that my Amazon account, and therefore my debit card, had been charged.   But how was the food? I really enjoyed the BKLT Wrap I got. And some of those salads looked wonderful. I especially want to try the Steak Nicoise Salad next time I stop in, since it was sold out by the time I got there.   Overall, it was a cool experience, especially to get to go to the very first day. I'll probably be back at some point. If you're in a rush, I could see this being a handy option to have."
1199,36210,Latifa S.,24/11/2020,Amazon Go,"In and out in no time? Yea this is it!!  Zero contact! Zero checking out. Literally grab your stuff and go. Gotta love the technology!

1200,41954,Patricia Skeritte,24/11/2021,Walmart,"Went online and bought Black Friday deals to pick up in store. What a mistake that was! I should of had it all mailed to my home. When I got to Walmart to pick up my order, which I received a text that said my order was ready for pick up, parked in correct place, checked in as instructed and then the wait began. After waiting 45 mins with seeing no Walmart employees I called the store to be told they were having lots of issues and I could be here a long time waiting or come back on Friday. The guy in Walmart said some people had been waiting over 200 mins and he didnâ€™t know what to tell me. Looking at the cars parked in the pick up area, only 4 cars including mine are sitting here. This is crazy...and never again will I pick up Black Friday deals ordered online! Terrible customer service!"
1201,41955,Not a returning customer,24/11/2021,Walmart,"Never been more disappointed with stores than my recent experience with Walmart. Bought a google nest hub online at Walmart with a 30 day return policy. Didnâ€™t know there was a difference between Walmart and Walmart marketplace (which is a fancy way of saying 3rd party products will be sold here like Amazon but will give you hell if you ever want to return or exchange). This was not well advertised on the website as I asked around and most people didnâ€™t know what marketplace stood for. Anyway, I took the product to a local Walmart where they said itâ€™s final sale despite it being less than 2 weeks since purchase ( at point of sale was told 30 day return policy). Was given a number to call and spoke to them got a reference number and was told this item did have a 30 day policy and to take it to another Walmart. Took a 45 minute transit ride to the next Walmart at 7 am and showed them the reference number and all. Was told they have to call the same number and get it approved on their end but they donâ€™t open till 8. I tried to ask if I can leave the item with them and they can reimburse me during the day as I used my Walmart MasterCard- they refused that too. I have a job to go to as a healthcare worker and this passing the parcel game that Walmart is playing is grating on my last nerve. Never subscribing to Walmart again and considering changing my Walmart MasterCard too. Very disappointing."
1202,41956,John Testa,24/11/2021,Walmart,They allow fraudulent sellers on their platform who provided fake tracking numbers. Reviews of merchant indicate a pattern of scamming yet Walmart continue to allow them to steal money. Walmart will not allow a dispute since it's a 3rd party seller. Had to go to my card issuer for a refund.

1208,41953,Jerrame Yarbrough,25/11/2021,Walmart,"One star is certainly more than they deserve. I ordered a dresser online. The description was sort of vague I admit. But it did say solid wood. They meant pressed wood obviously. I tried to do a return after they delivered the item to my house. They said they would come pick it up. They never did. So I called them and they said they would refund my money asap if I took it back to the closest Walmart. They did that, and I did take it back to the nearest Walmart. Then they sent me an Email saying they were going to charge me again if I didn't take it back to FedEx. I'm like wait a minute, you tried to rip me off, then you try to punish me because I didn't fall for it. Plus it cost me money and time to take the item all the way back to Walmart in Cortez CO 74 miles away. Then they sent me another email telling me they charged my debit card, which I had to have my bank cancel because of their scam. Jokes on them. No big deal. I just have to change my phone bills and everything else over to a different debit card. And I still got my solid wood dresser from Amazon. Solid pine to be exact. Which they gave a very good description. Thank you Amazon. In fact, I got a whole set. A dresser and two night stands. And for a good price. Didn't cost me very much more than Walmarts garbage. I highly recommend Amazon for furniture. You put it together yourself but it's well worth it. I don't recommend buying anything from Walmart online. I never will again. And the Edison furniture is phenomenal for the price! Very solid products!"

Itâ€™s Black Friday itâ€™s Christmas! They canceled my order that I have been trying to get at Walmart since this ps5 was released. So because I tried to purchase 2 things- Walmart canceled. That makes no sense! I feel like it was a scam from the start. I was very disappointed in the way Walmartâ€™s site when it kept crashing, but this put the icing on the cake! I donâ€™t think I will return after this one. Did they sell too many so they had to cancel one ? I donâ€™t understand why they just canceled it without even trying to reach out to me. I even called them super fast and it was too late."
1215,44058,WS R,26/11/2020,Walmart,walmart black friday scam. I was ready and added to cart clicked to pay and then told out of stock. less than 30sec. that seams scammy to me. went to best buy. better experience so far
1216,44059,Lisa Jaquez,26/11/2020,Walmart,Was there at exactly 8:59 pm last night ready to purchase an Xbox but your site is rigged!!! First didnâ€™t let me add to cart which I get itâ€™s like a contest and whoever gets it first BUT then kept removing out of my cart before I completed the purchase! Atleast give 30 seconds before allowing something to be taken from someoneâ€™s cart! Having in cart should hold your Order Atleast for a minute while itâ€™s completed!!! Managed to put in my cart several times and go all the way through delivery date total everything in less than 5 secs and still when I hit submit it was out of my cart and out of stock!!! Itâ€™s like waiting in line with your item and then someone snatching it from you at the register !!!!ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ These online sales should be handled similar to ticket master ! Once you â€œgrabâ€ your spot you are given 2 minutes to complete the sale before itâ€™s released from your cart! I had 5 family members trying to purchase and no one was successful because itâ€™s not humanly possible!!!! Fix your crappy system! Or let ppl go back to standing in line ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬
1217,44060,Ben Concepcion,26/11/2020,Walmart,"Walmart's lack of insight despite the billions made in retail are appalling in your failure to stop bots from PS5 piracy. The millions spent on cyber security should easily fix this for the consumer to get a product. Walmart I am disgusted at the greed, your company was founded on better beliefs!"
1218,44061,ryan mckenna,26/11/2020,Walmart,"This PS5 sales is absolutely a joke Walmart. Pls explain to me how I had one in the cart. Put in all my info, confirmed pick up at the store. Only to be told â€œOut of stockâ€. If you take out $540 out of my account. Come Friday you better have one in stock for me."
1219,44062,Ilan,26/11/2020,Walmart,"walmart.com is a scam! This year in the incredibly expected Black Friday I wanted to buy the Airpods Pro. They announced that the sale started on the 25th at 7pm. At exactly that time I attempted to buy my product and succeeded. However, a few minutes later they sent an email cancelling the order and, of course, now the product is out of stock. I expected more from a brand like Walmart. DON'T PROMOTE PRODUCTS YOU DON'T HAVE! AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, DO NOT CANCEL AN ORDER BECAUSE OF YOUR LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY."
1220,44063,AC Ransom,26/11/2020,Walmart,Never again! It is like rolli g dice with these people they promise you a delivery date to get tiur money then after that it is anyones guess as to if they actually have the item available and whether or jot it is new or used... Just dont! Save yourself the headache.
1221,44064,cj freeman,26/11/2020,Walmart,Iâ€™m sick of this...how the hell the ps5 sell out the same damn time as the restock.. we gotta do better.. we got kids wishing for this system for Christmas and yâ€™all playing games..
1222,44065,Sean Belanger,26/11/2020,Walmart,So this PS5 is a joke or shall I say Wal-Mart site is a joke. Release day at work all 3 times 12pm 3pm 6pm I was logged in right at time hit buy went to cart ick checkout gone sold out each time after it was in my cart. Then the next day they did it I was logged in ready again get into cart click checkout gone again. Tonight all ready at 9pm click checkout gone again. Wal-Mart sucks period
1223,44066,Samantha Diaz,26/11/2020,Walmart,Horrible. Idk know why Walmart send release dates for the PS5 for 9pm when at 9pm it says OUT OF STOCK because scammers and Bot takes over. How can a human beat a BOT??? So unfair I guess Walmart and all the other companies that allow BOT robots to buy theirs items are scammers just as well.
1224,44067,Paula Dabel,26/11/2020,Walmart,"I am very disappointed in Walmart online black Wednesday release of the PS5 at 8pm CST. How is it possible for all the consoles to be sold by 8:01pm. I was able to put one in my cart but it was removed. I am so dissatisfied with this I have tried each time this product was offered.... obviously, the bots have the advantage."
1225,44068,Christopher Marczewska,26/11/2020,Walmart,Tried to order a in stock item. Selected add item and of course it times out. Now it's no longer in stock.Guess their IT is as crappy as the Made in China items they have been selling to cut cost.
1226,44073,Rodney Ramcharitar Sciampacone,26/11/2020,Walmart,"Ordering online can create headaches. Beware of their third-party sellers, it will be harder to get the right support from them. Some times they don't even ship items properly or pack it well, and it would arrive damaged. I don't believe they should allow other sellers on their website, I feel it degrades their reputation and service towards us. Also, using carriers like Canpar or Purolator for expensive items especially is a drag, because we would have to wait all day long just to make sure they won't leave it by our porch unattended, and not give us notice of their arrival. This happens too often. Got a few of our packages stolen this way. Too bad we can't select which carrier we would like, would make life easier. Either way, it's always best to do your shopping directly in the stores instead of online. More products are available online though, and Walmart always had my back when something didn't go right. Nothing is perfect but it's near enough. This review is based on my online experience. In-stores 5 stars. Thanks."
1227,44265,Former customer,26/11/2020,Walmart,I will be shopping from amazon from now on. Not only is the money center staff and managers horrible in petersburg va. But NOW online shopping sucks. You guys lost a loyal customer right before the holidays. And corporate thanks for not handling that situation smh.(Walmart)
1228,41948,Maurine Can O Py,26/11/2021,Walmart,We are winter Texans. We have always had our prescriptions filled at Walmart. Then when in Texas we have them filled there. Recently we had a problem. Walmart in San Benito was having computer problems and we tried to get a prescription transferred from Forest lake Mn to San Benito Tx. Iâ€™ve never had such Terrible customer service. Forest lake transferred the prescription to San Benito but because of their computer issues they could not bring it up. So they called Forest lake for a verbal. Forest lake then said they didnâ€™t have a prescription for my husband because it was then out of their system. I tried calling both Walmartâ€™s several times to explain the problem. No one helped a bit. Said they would have to contact the dr. This is a Friday after Thanksgiving. Then with the weekend who knows when it will happen. No one cared that he had a valid prescription and it is now lost in the system. Even when we gave them the prescriptions number. I was told I could take my prescriptions any where I wanted to get refilled. And in the future I will. And no longer shop at Walmart
1229,41949,Michael,26/11/2021,Walmart,"Ordered a product and never received it, e-mail says it was delivered but it wasnâ€™t. First the order was delayed but then it was supposedly delivered on the original date. Never will I ever order from them again, they couldnâ€™t replace the item."
1230,41951,customer,26/11/2021,Walmart,I placed an order yet again with Walmart and the first time I spent nearly $200 never received the item yet I waited almost 3 weeks. This time I place the order several days ago received several emails stating itâ€™s prepared for shipment then delivery from a nearby store to now itâ€™s delayed. I contacted cyst services the representative told me 5 different things I asked to speak to a supervisor over 4 times finally the supervisor tried to downplay the amount of money I spent and had no information accept wait until Saturday because the computer had no information. Which then he said wait until Friday then contact them at 9 or 10 pm he told me several different stories. If I could rate Walmart a zero I would. I plan on shopping at Amazon because Walmart Sucks and keeps taking advantage of people and not giving the products.
1231,47249,Nard,27/11/2016,Walmart,"WALMART is just as guilty as OJ commerce. Scammers now have our information. We were offered no explanation from Walmart, Thanks a lot for continuing to stomp on the little guy!"
1232,47151,Rachel Mendoza,27/11/2017,Walmart,"They have low prices, but they have long lines. The prices here are great! Cheaper than Target and such. The lines are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long."
1233,46963,Rob Fleener,27/11/2018,Walmart,"""I ordered a Insta Pot 6 qt 10 in 1 programmable pressure cooker on cyber Monday for 89.00. I went into the store to pick up on Tuesday and was told it was out of stock. I could order it again, but the price would be 149.00. It shows in stock in many of the local super centers. I have been trying to support Walmart, but I guess itâ€™s back to Amazon! This is just wrong and an expensive lesson for me!"""
1234,46964,Theresa,27/11/2018,Walmart,Had the worst customer service on walmart.com. I spent two days trying to resolve a problem.I was trying to purchasing items that was close to 700.00. They kept canceling my order because of security issues. When I called my bank they told me that Wal-Mart kept canceling my order for no reason. When I called Wal-Mart.com they didn't want to help me. I missed out of cyber Monday deals and they wouldn't help me. By the end of the conversation today the lady actually told me to shop somewhere else.
1235,46965,Fickle,27/11/2018,Walmart,"Purchased phone cases, paid via PayPal, funds paid to Walmart, contacted them regarding item, was sent a reply email that the items were cancelled without my knowledge, ordered from another company!"
1236,44050,Jeff,27/11/2020,Walmart,"I was sold an out of stock item. I bought it, waited a week, and still said preparing order Instead of cancelling it, they said I should just wait for a restock, which could take â€œa few monthsâ€ I cannot wait to start seeing these stores go out of business."
1237,44051,Joe Joe,27/11/2020,Walmart,cameron hughett he was a jerk to me the last time I was down there and he was on duty and I asked him to show me where something is and what aisle it is in and he refused and he called me stupid and I don't like being called stupid

I hate walmart as it is,now I have another reason not to trust your corrupt company!L.M.Alvarez,Joshua Tree,Ca."
1239,41940,Billy,27/11/2021,Walmart,"Overall a very well run company with excellent prices offering value to the shopper. They need to enforce the ""mask rule"" better in their stores, and that includes their employees. They are the #1 company for a reason. I switched from the dreadful Walgreens and so far am happy by getting better prices, better quality, and better selection with nicer people. One store manager was exceptionally good and recognized the importance/value of customers."
1240,41941,Kari M.,27/11/2021,Walmart,"Their delivery service is the WORST. You would think as greedy as they are they would at least pretend to put in effort in satisfying their customers. Late deliveries, deliveries marked as delivered and are not delivered, canâ€™t choose your own substitutes, never have anything in stock, customer service is outsourced to other countries which is not a problem but they take forever and never have a solution, they donâ€™t reimburse you for their trash service. Whatâ€™s the point of paying for Walmart+ when there are literally no perks except free delivery? When that doesnâ€™t even matter because the delivery service is trash/late/cancelled and then you have to wait until they feel like delivering it.. I never trash companies but they deserve it and Iâ€™m posting it everywhere I can."
1241,41942,Tc Banta,27/11/2021,Walmart,Neosho Walmart #17 was amazing! They had my order ready pick up no contact for Black Friday items. Placed item in my vehicle and off we go! So painless and easy! We have a few Walmart stores around not all are created equal. The store employees and management make the difference! Our Walmart is top notch! Thank you store 17!

1243,41944,Gerald Wright,27/11/2021,Walmart,I bought into the Walmart+ to get the 4 hour head start on Christmas shopping. I ordered three items and they were scheduled for delivery on Fri and Sat. I later received a message that the items will be delivered early by Wed night. I get a message later Wed night that the shipping is delayed until Fri. I get a message on Fri morning that all three items were cancelled for not picking up the order. I did finally find a way to contact the Walmart help line. They tell me the item was not in stock and that was the reason it was cancelled. They gave me $20 credit for a future purchase. While I appreciated the professionalism and gesture made by the service rep it was lacking. I would expect something of similar value to reduce the poor experience.
1244,41945,Kimmy,27/11/2021,Walmart,"i bought a baby swing online. the two sets i was interested in were completely unclear as to what was included, especially when it came to fittings. very disappointed. i had to make a return. i wasted my time."
1245,41946,Joe Cardiff,27/11/2021,Walmart,"Went to Walmart, first waited 30 mins for the guy to come unlock game case only to realize at checkout he gave me the wrong one. So ok whatever that happens I guess nobody's perfect but when leaving the lady stopped me and treated me like a thief after literally watching me check out then walk to customer service to fix the aforementioned ""mistake"". It really makes you feel like a scumbag letting everybody else walk by you while you get checked. On a side note while I was in the store I reported a theft to the staff but I guess it doesn't matter at Walmart everyone's a suspect not everyone just me, after spending over $500 this trip. Really not cool."
1246,41947,Lin,27/11/2021,Walmart,"Walmart uses Ontrac as their primary shipper for their â€œfree or reduced shippingâ€, people donâ€™t fall for it! Check out ontrac as an organization! Ontrac consistently claims they deliver packages when they donâ€™t and in turn when you contact Walmart they tell you â€œoh yeah the package hasnâ€™t been delivered wait 48 hours if you donâ€™t receive it call us back and we will issue a refundâ€ They know their packages are getting lost yet they do nothing to hold the shipper accountable. And as for their customer service well an American company outsourcing their customer service where the rep had roosters crowing in the background give me a break! I was all in with Walmart but this has just blown it out of the water! Poorest customer experience ever! Shame on you Walmart! Poor showing!"
1247,41950,Peace of God,27/11/2021,Walmart,I purchased a Baby shark desk in July 2021. The desk was damaged so I returned it. I tried to get a replacement or refund and got NEITHER!!! Now it's Nov. 2021 ðŸ™„
1248,47248,Angela Blanchard,28/11/2016,Walmart,Since they have allowed fourth party sales this company has gone to the dogs. They want to say they are not responsible but they are. They let OJ Commerce rip off customer's who were using their site trusting they would be taken care of only to find out the opposite happened. With noone wanting to help or make good on sales so dealing with Wal-Mart.com is no longer safe to buy from. Will go somewhere else from now on.
1249,46961,Beth Geiger,28/11/2018,Walmart,"Worst return process of any website. Stick to Amazon. I bought 6 window valances on Walmart.com, because they had the best price. But once the package arrived, the color did not work for me. I took the package (in which the box was damaged in transit) to my local Walmart store to return it, per their website. I was told since it was a ""3rd party"" item, they were only able to print me 6 return labels. Then I had to re-package each item (at my cost) into 6 individual packages (not into the original box) each with a separate shipping label....and to make matters worse, I was charged both a $3.50 restocking fee AND $7.95 shipping fee for each valance. My whopping total of my refund was only $6.04 for a $17.49 priced item (So a $104.69 order, they only refunded me $47.70) ..â€¦.DON'T ever ORDER from WALMART.COM"
1250,46962,Leslie,28/11/2018,Walmart,Same here showed items were available and paid a week ago for them to email me out of stock and still has a hold on my money
1251,44046,M. Baig,28/11/2020,Walmart,"Worst service. And this is not one time, it happened atleast 3 times. On 11/27/2020 I visited Dublin walmart for a site to store pickup. Checked in via app for pickup at 6:50pm. Got a message ""see you in store"" at 6:51pm. Had to wait till 7:37pm to finally ""see"" a staff member to help. During the 46 minute wait called store twice, spoke to somebody, paged on the store system twice, called customer service on walmart.com. Horrible experience on the call. To everyone, please avoid Dublin walmart store pickup, and for any business if possible."

1255,41933,Candence Martinez,28/11/2021,Walmart,"I started the online Walmart shopping during the pandemic because as we all can remember it not safe to head out to the store for fear of getting mortality ill. It started out as a semi good experience. However, a year later things went from â€œsemi goodâ€ to HORRIBLY BAD! As we all know when youâ€™re looking to make a purchase of a particular item you look for a Walmart near you that might have that item for pick up. Or you can wait to have it delivered to your home. In the summer I made a purchase for an item I was to pick up at the Naugatuck Connecticut store. An hour before I was to pick up those items I received an email stating that It was SOLD OUT! â€œSold out?â€ How could that be possible? Especially when the money of $18 came out of my account. Needless to say I never received my item nor had I received my money back. Iâ€™m still working on this to this day. But fast forward to today. I went on the app to find a particular toy for my grandson so he can have it for Christmas. I did the same thing I did the last time when I made a purchase. I looked to see which stores had it. And again, it gave me the Naugatuck store. I made the purchase which was $129 and I was to pick it up 4 hours later. Two hours before my pick up time I received an email stating my order had been â€œCANCELLEDâ€! This time this was no chump change and I WAS NOT GOING TO LET THIS SLIDE! I called the Naugatuck store to no avail. There were NOT ANSWERING THE PHONE. So I called corporate who said â€œyes maâ€™am.â€ â€œSorry maâ€™am.â€ You know ALL THE BS words they typically say to when the mess up. But instead of giving me my money back right away as they took right away, I am going to have to wait 7 days! I WILL NEVER SHOP FROM WALMART.COM EVER AGAIN AND Iâ€™D SUGGEST NO ONE ELSE DO EITHER! The experience is horrible. THEY ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL OR HONORABLE WHAT SO EVER! DONT waste your time with them when you can use their competitors online shopping apps instead. Iâ€™ve used other large chain stores and NEVER HAD A PROBLEM! In my opinion Walmart CANNOT HANDLE ONLINE SHOPPING! And for that, they do not deserve to use our time because all theyâ€™re doing is wasting it!"
1256,41934,Dolores,28/11/2021,Walmart,"I had great customer service when I was purchasing a Christmas tree at the Lakeside location.The manager, Johnathon, was very helpful. They were out of the tree I wanted and he called another store to see if they had one. They didnâ€™t and I asked if I could purchase the floor model. He asked another supervisor and he was able to sell it to me with a 10% discount. He took it all down and brought it to my car. Johnathon was very helpful and it was a great experience"
1257,41935,Nancy L Billings,28/11/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a very specific part for my new tankless hot water heater vent. What I got was something entirely different that sold for a lot less than the part I ordered and paid for. I called Customer Service and they reordered the correct item and sent me a return label for the incorrect part. I re-sealed the package and affixed the return label and took it to the Post Office all within 1 hour of receiving the wrong item. The customer service rep said I should receive my replacement item within 5 days. Now, I find out that Walmart uses SurePost for their returns and that they are not going to process the order for the correct item until they receive the item that was originally shipped! It looks as though I will probably not receive the replacement item for about 2 weeks based on my tracking of the original shipment. Other vendors will send the replacement as soon as the shipping label is scanned. I will NEVER order from Walmart.com again."
1258,41937,Lesa Weller,28/11/2021,Walmart,Shipping takes forever. Itâ€™s impossible to cancel a Walmart membership.

I recived several e mails stating the delivery would be earlier like 11/25/2021 better stick around house for delivery you do not want to leave a 70 flat screen on the frt porch to long. guess what late in the day another email stating the delivery would be delayed back to 11/27 wasted day. well the 11/27 day comes and by 8pm it is dark no delivery, but wait a email arrives that Jammie has delivered it to my frt porch and we have included a picture of the delivery. First of all my 3 dogs did not bark at all that night, second the tv was not on my frt porch and third the so called delivery picture sent was just a black square with no photo at all. My belief is that the store never had the tv in stock for me and just jerked me off thinking I would get tired of waiting and cancel the order. Last ever purchase by me at Walmart. As a matter of fact I purchased 2 laptops for christmas presents that I will be returning and I will go else where and purchase them at a competitor"

This can be found in the small print on the home page of the item. If you have problems with the item Walmart WILL NOT stand behind you.

On Jones loop, was the worst customer service I ever received she was rude and nasty will not be going back. I warn anyone who needs something to not go to her. I waited I line asked my question at my turn and when she told me they were out I said okay for all the series? she then ignored me and then rolled her eyes and nastily asked me why I was still there she has a line and Iâ€™m holding it up. When I continue to ask my second question she said are your serious we out means we are out what canâ€™t you understand about that please leave your holding up the line... there was one person in line"

I ordered a Christmas tree November 19th got the confirmation email with a deliver date of Nov 22nd well that day I got the ornaments I ordered but. I tree. I called them on the 23rd to find out they were shipping it out then, I then tried asking for a refund but customer service people do not listen and always cut you off. It is now Nov 29th I was told that my tree would be in on the 28th and agin nothing. I finally was able to cancel the order but have to wait like 5 days for my money back. So ridiculous. Avoid ordering from here look at other stores. Walmart sucks. I spent days and I donâ€™t know how many hours trying to figure this out and got nowhere."
1267,46004,David,29/11/2019,Walmart,"Do not order online with Walmart. I ordered a Black Friday special for the Apple Watch Series 3 and they cancelled it 3 days later saying it is not in stock. Customer service did useless and will not offer any compensation for this issue saying it is within the terms of use. If you enjoy wasting your time and money, Walmart online is for you. Just go to the store in person if you really want something so they canâ€™t cancel on you, or in my recommendation avoid them altogether."
1268,44039,keys boogie,29/11/2020,Walmart,I ordered a tv and when they delivered it they didn't even knock. Just so happened to walk outside and see it. That is very unprofessional! What if somebody walked off with it.
1269,44040,RLC Outdoors,29/11/2020,Walmart,Bought a mattress topper at the Angloton store it had a big rip in it .. we where camping at Brazos Ben State Park and it was raining. so I just wait till we got home and would take it to the La marque store to return it .. well you guess it they said No because it had been open.

But With the other couple the manger told them to go get another one not to open it they would exchange it the next day. Will never go back to this Store
1270,44041,Katina Puckett,29/11/2020,Walmart,"Was Christmas shopping and decided to stop in this Wendover Walmart location. Was greeted by a very nice young lady working the carts of front. Me and my husband continued back to electronics to ask if they possibly had a Playstation 5 console in stock for sale. As the employee working at the front desk asked what I needed and started to shake his head no once I told him, a MANAGER by the name JOHN that had just walked up and heard what I was asking for VERY RUDLY LAUGHED AND SAID SHES FUNNY! We were lost for words and I continued threw the store and asked a few employees about this particular manager to find out there has been NUMEROUS complaints on this Manager for how he talks to customers and employees. This Manager John has NO IDEA HOW TO TALK TO CUSTOMERS and his LACK of CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE is very apparent after the way you spoke toward me and my husband in store today. "" IN NO TYPE OF WAY WAS MY QUESTION FUNNY OR DESERVED A DESCUSTING SMART REMARK IN RETURN "" Walmart is a retail store that sells game systems SO I ASKED ! Wasn't even talking to the manager to begin with, he just decided to put in his potty mouth remarks. I truly hope someone steps in and decides to put a REAL MANAGER in his place that truly has some sort of CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE because Mr. John definitely is NOT the one! I definitely will not be returning to this Walmart location on Wendover ave."
1271,44042,TheDoctor Tardis HI,29/11/2020,Walmart,"In spite of the CEO glad-handing and ads full of propaganda about what a fine job Walmart employees are doing, I have not seen this level of customer service from my local store, particularly not from the management. Usually, it is the brand new, hired-for-the-holidays lowly cashiers and stockers who provide the most helpful service. Meanwhile, managers seem to avoid eye contact with customers, silently radiating the message that they can't be bothered to help with anything. I saw one manager at the Woodruff Rd Walmart with her required mask down around her chin and doing no one any good, and she did not put it in its proper place even when she passed within two feet of customers. Consideration for others is clearly not high on the priority list... for management, anyway."
1272,44043,Candice C,29/11/2020,Walmart,"This place looks decent, the associates however could not be worst. The store is quiet, oddly not busy at all, and an elderly guy in a cart is having trouble loading his cart at a self-serve... 2 associates are standing within feet of him, watching this for about 2-3 minutes and doing nothing to help him. I realize his struggle, helped the guy to get his bags into the basket, I commented to the associates, who then whispered to each other, and continued to stand there, look away, and do nothing. Walmart is not customer kind or elderly friendly, at all. And do not bother talking to a manager, they will leave you unattended as well, indefinite."
1273,44044,Deborah D. Brewer,29/11/2020,Walmart,"Last Black Friday deals was supposed to be online at 12 am but while waiting to purchase quite a few things they said you have to come into the store to purchase it but online and in the weekly paper it states that you suppose to buy online at that certain time, so at 5am I waited in the line. I was the fourth customer. While in the store there were no towels that was priced at 1.60, no pillows that was priced at 5.00, no bikes that was priced at 29.00. Only the lady said we have to get the bikes that were not assembled but it did not state that in the paper no jeans, no pot set sets were in the store. Wasn't nothing in that store that was for online pricing at that time. That is false advertising and they should be held accountable for that, it made no sense to get out the bed that early for things that's not in stores."
1274,44045,Mike Colvin,29/11/2020,Walmart,As a Walmart employee at the 5185 store Walmart is the best place i can get my groceries and get the gaming i need in a quick hurry matter they always had what i needed and i love working for them.
1275,41931,Andrea Terry,29/11/2021,Walmart,"Horrible..Horrible...Horrible new online system. Difficult to identify what will ship as normal and what you have to pick up. On thanksgiving 3 of us sat at the dining room and ordered Christmas items. Only to discover at check out we either had to pick up or pay ridiculous shipping (these were not grocery type items) on some of the items. If I wanted to go to the store, I wouldn't be ordering online. The 1/3 screen checkout box is difficult to see/scroll all items in a large order. Ultimately, we cancelled all three orders. Walmart got nothing. Coincidentally, we saw a Kohl's ad on TV (I've never shopped there), went on their site, had a great experience...great discount and Kohl's cash. Goodbye Walmart."

1277,41936,arizona,29/11/2021,Walmart,"The drivers is stealing the product. They will pull up at ur house n pull off then walmart will send u an email saying ur order is delayed. I'm still waiting on my order from 11/22. I went to the store to pick it up n a working told me that I have a TV on my order he hope they haven't stealing my order that the manager was going through the orders to see what all they had left because the drivers was not delivering or was not bringing the orders back. My order supposed to got delivered Friday but was delayed. Walmart need to press charges against all the drivers that have stealing orders. They should have just told me to pick my order up from the store, I ordered online because it's to danger to go out n shop black Friday here. This is the worst ideal walmart have had for product on black friday. Update on my order 13 hours later: I call the 800 number n got the stores that my order was at n finally got my order from 2 different stores. 2 items at one n 2 at the other so if anyone still waiting on their order from 11/22 see can u call get the store n go to the store to pick up ur order."
1278,47149,EJ,30/11/2017,Walmart,"Horrible. I shopped there. No more. What a group of highly, highly incompetent people working Walmart.com. I think a group of monkeys could do a better job. Omg....screw up everything, make excuses for why they screwed up, no accountability. Very sad. At least the monkeys are kind of cute...  Do not try to compete with Amazon. You are not even on the same planet."
1279,46957,Melissa,30/11/2018,Walmart,"So if you want completely unreliable customer service shop at Walmart! Paid for my order, received confirmation that I could pick it up that day but to wait for a time that theyâ€™ll have it ready, and HOURS later it was cancelled. Then contacted customer service and was told that since the store sold out it is being shipped to the store. So it was supposed to be shipped to the store today but my card was refunded! So I contacted customer service again and they found the note of everything but said that I wouldnâ€™t be able to get the order that I was promised TWICE! Because it was never shipped and now sold out! This company is pathetic and just tells you whatever they can to try make you believe they value customers. Ridiculous, so disappointing to be let down more than twice for the same freaking order."
1280,46958,Hua Jin yang,30/11/2018,Walmart,"I brought a item far Walmart.com, I didnâ€™t receive on the day it was supposed to be arrive. I called Walmart.com service team. They answer to this issue is for me to wait, it will arrive someday. So I call the Fedex to find out that they have not receive my item fromWalmart.com."
1281,46959,Stacy,30/11/2018,Walmart,"Worst return experience. I received a gift sent from walmart online for my child. Since my child had received two of the same items from different people, I opted to return the one to walmart since the item came with packing label and receipt. I expected this would be an easy process. All I wanted to do was exchange it for another item of similar cost in store. I was told at customer service that they would have to do a return first, then I could find something else in store to purchase since the item was purchased online. Fine. I was expecting a walmart gift card but the sales associate walked off to another computer and came back and said the amount was returned to the card that paid for the item. THIS WAS A GIFT! The sales associate managed to contact head office and reverse the return ( I decided to just keep the item), but guess what? The person who bought the item received an automatic email that the item had been returned and the account would be credited. I will never in the future purchase gifts for people on walmart.ca . They are not returnable and how embarrassing for anyone who tries to exchange a gift. Just to be clear, this was not the sales associate's fault, it's Walmart that has terrible policies regarding items purchased from walmart.ca, even when the items are purchased from Walmart, not external sellers."
1282,46960,april,30/11/2018,Walmart,i am usually a very loyal customer of walmart. this summer i ordered 2 items from them online and had no problem at all. i ordered a tv from them and was told by store associate that tv's would be on sale black friday so i returned one that i ordered. i tried for 2 hours to order and called customer service. it took 45 minutes to get someone on line. i was told there was a problem with website and to try back in 2 hours. it still did not work. tried next day. so i lost out. i realize this is an unbelievable busy time but i will not do any more online shopping on black friday. it's a joke. and i've missed out on the deal with the first tv i ordered.
1283,45992,Scarlett,30/11/2019,Walmart,"What an absolute fing NIGHTMARE and SCAM! I wish I could give them a rating of -0. NEVER EVER USE WAL-MART.COM OR AFFIRM! Our tv kicked the bucket so We decided to splurge a little bit and upgrade (We work hard and don't splurge often so why not an early Christmas present right?) So we orderd a '70inch TV off of Wal-mart.com using their financing company Affirm. That was November 13th and our tv was delivered on the 18th. When our tv arrived we opend it to find a split down the back and when we plugged it in it looked like nothing but neon water color. We were completely bummed but since we orderd it from Wal-mart.com we called our local store explained the situation and asked if we could exchange it. The ales associate I talked to (Jean) said ""sure. No problem"". So my husband and I drove down to the store and we were directed to electronics. We explained to them the situation showed them the recipt and tv. They did say that they don't carry RCA anymore but that they have a 65inch tv better quality and cheaper. My husband and I were fine with that, chose a TV and went to customer service to finish the transaction...thinking it would take only few minutes depending if there was a line. The associate upfront was Jean. At first she was very nice and helpful because apparently there was a hiccup with exchanging because although it was orderd from Wal-mart.com because we used their financing and not a straight up Wal-mart card there was an issue (which btw I'm still kind of confused about). After she figured there was a hiccup she became rude and short and said ""I've been working for 14 hours and I haven't eaten. I can't deal with this anymore. Call Wal-mart.com"" and she huffed away and completely ignored my husband and I hit bossily told her fellow associate to take the tv we brought in back to our car that she would no longer be helping us. We were dumb founded and speechless. So we took our tv back home and called Wal-mart.com We explained to the associate at Wal-mart.com our situation. She apologized and then put us on hold for 20 minutes. She came back and said that we can't take the tv to a store even though we orderd it from Wal-mart.com that we would have to have it picked up but that they will put in an order to have another one shipped and that it would arrive December 2nd. We asked if she could expedite the shipping since the tv came damaged. She said that they don't do that. At this point it was late, we were tired and we figured what's a few weeks without a TV, having a 70ich will be a payoff. The company picked up the tv on time the following Monday. We waited a few days to check the status of our new tv and all it said was processing. So we called Wal-mart.com customer service. After giving the associate our information and asking her what the status is with our tv she put us on hold for 20 minutes. She finally comes back and says ""we are still waiting for the old tv to be accepted and processed but you should still recieve your tv on 12/2"". This conversation (and being on hold for 20 minutes each time)took place several times because the status never changed with the damaged tv. Each time we looked it said processed. So today I called. Ill be honest my patience was gone and I was short with the associate. I had had enough of the run around. I explained our situation to the male associate and explained that I'm frustrated and sick of waiting and that i want to know what's going on. After being put on hold for 20 minutes so they can ""check The status"" The associate came back and stated that the damaged tv has still to be processed and because it hasn't been processed the earliest we could have a TV deliverd is 12/12 if they get it processed within the next 24 hours and if they don't It could take longer. Well that did it. I admit I lost it. I told the associate that this was unacceptable and the WORST customer service EVER! That they can pick up a damaged tv on time but not process it and get a new one out in a timely manner. I told the customer service that it's unacceptable to put customers on hold for 20 minutes EVERY SINGLE TIME to do some that takes 30 seconds to a minute because i too once worked in customer service. He said this is the best he could offer. I explained to him that i wanted to speak to a manager. He put me on hold for 15 minutes then hung up on me. I called back and this time spoke to a female associate. I told her to cancel my order because they are nothing but a scam and that i would let everyone know. WHAT A NIGHTMARE!! DO NOT USE WAL-MART.COM OR AFFIRM!! NOT WORTH IT!! WAL-MART YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!!"
1284,45993,Steph Strayer,30/11/2019,Walmart,"Items frequently arrive damaged. And, although the Walmart website states items can be returned to any store... that is s lie. Walmart and Walmart.com are separate entities. The problem is you do not know what items are Walmart or Walmart.com when ordering. I call it fraudulent advertising."
1285,45995,Carrie Basak Harness,30/11/2019,Walmart,"Lesson learned. Last year I bought sommething from Walmart.com that they never delivered. Went round and round to get a refund. By then couldn't get what I ordered as I needed it for Christmas gift. This year bought 4 movies online. Half the order is incorrect. Shipped right titles but wrong versions. You will not find a phone number online to speak with anyone. Called store and they were completely worthless. Now I have to return product, already ordered from Best Buy. Their website is awesome and customer service rocks. I am done with Walmart!! I pray they go the way of Sears and close. They treat their customers the way they treat their employees, horrible!"
1286,45996,Elaine,30/11/2019,Walmart,"Two major things:  - Family and Handicapped Restrooms are mainly used by employees who are neither handicapped nor bring their family to work with them. People using scooters or canes have to wait . Employees often take water bottles and their phones into these specialized rooms to use for a break or they are ""in a hurry"" as one manager just said to me.  - Dogs or cats posing as service animals are a hazard to customers who have severe allergies to each.  -I've written to Doug McMillon and to Mr. Taft in Legal Dept. Am looking for an attorney to take this company on,, but probably won't due to the size and that I live on Social Security ....pro bono necessary."
1287,45997,Susan Annette Mann Moody,30/11/2019,Walmart,The Black Friday online was a joke for 2019. Have shopped many BF before and nothing like this one. Out of stock before I could check out which was 10 minutes as I was ready. Went to Amazon and bought several items cheaper.

Get to Walmart and they first can't find my order and then proceed to tell me they can't find the items. I volunteer to go get them because it has been 3 hours. I find them and they tell me that won't work because they didn't find it. Seriously?! I'm holding the item in my hands and they day I'll get my money back in 3-5 business days. Khaled at order pick up is so set on ""policy"" he won't even listen to what is starring him in the face. Needless to say I will not being coming back or using this service again. And yes, I understand that it is Black Friday but all my other stores (4) had the orders ready in less than 1 hour. Walmart you need to ho back to the drawing board and put customer service first."

Show the electronics kid the available listing""We haven't had those in months""  Wal-Mart used to have pretty good real time stock status. Now just a scam to get you to the store.  Not that cheap anymore...used to save $20-$30+ on a cart,now if it's $5-$10 not even worth shopping there if nothing is in stock and I have to get stuff elsewhere anyway.  Then do an online pickup order and they substitute 3 of 8 out of stock items with no confirmation  Total waste of my time and $$"

1292,44034,Cliff Hofferbert,30/11/2020,Walmart,I've been using Walmart home delivery service. It is a nightmare. I always get cut 4 to 6 items a order. Always get substituted items. I received some body else's order. The app stalls between departments. Then I have to still go to our Publix store to get the cut items! Walmart always ask me to do reviews after each order! But they never follow up and never solve my problems!

1294,44036,Megan Lippert,30/11/2020,Walmart,"They have cancelled every single thing I ordered online now because they keep running out. Iâ€™ve tried to order six different things cyber Monday deals and every single item has gotten cancelled with this message: â€œWe're very sorry, but due to high demand, we were unable to fulfill the items listed and had to cancel them.â€ Donâ€™t list something as in stock and let people order it if itâ€™s not actually in stock.... I feel bad for the employees because it isnâ€™t their fault, but shame on Walmart for that. Get your online algorithms together. I could see it happening once or twice but for every single thing I ordered... highly disappointing"
1295,44037,Alicia Taylor,30/11/2020,Walmart,"Before everyone starts spending beaucoups of money on Walmart.com i would like to warn about their shady dealings with what they call third party sellers. I myself spent a lot of money on the website and had an issue with an item that i was refunded for. Six months later the money was taken out of my account. I relentlessly contacted what was supposed to be Walmart.com support. My calls were escalated each time yet still no satisfactory result or conclusion was reached. Needless to say i still havenâ€™t received anything in the form of repayment from Walmart because as they stated they could not contact the third party seller and they did not feel responsible for the issue!! In short if you want zero confusion on orders this cyber Monday/Christmas think twice about purchasing from Walmart.com!!!  Sincerely, disgruntled ex-customer!!"
1296,44038,Mr. Doodle,30/11/2020,Walmart,"I decided to try their online delivery service for groceries. My first order went ok. My 2nd order did not go so well. I received someone else's groceries. I didn't even know there were groceries out there until I checked and then 15 minutes later I get a text alerting me the groceries have been delivered. I call customer service immediately and spoke to Mateo, he assured me he had called the store and they would be delivering the correct groceries. 3 hours pass by and nothing. I call customer service again and the agent was not able to get through to the store, he tried numerous times and noone at the store picked up. That definitely left a bad impression. He asked that I call them again in 20 minutes, which I did. This time the 3rd agent told me that he would need to offer me a refund. I wasn't asking for a refund, I was asking for the correct order of groceries be delivered to me. His comment was since I did receive groceries they were not going to fulfill my order. What??!!! I just about had it. I told him the order that was delivered was not mine, but they did not care. Now I have to wait 3-5 business days to get my money back and go do groceries someone else after I recover from Covid. In the meantime, my kids are left with nothing to eat until then. Never again will I patronize Walmart in any way! This is the most horrible experience in times of a pandemic where I relied on a service that was not delivered."

Each time they assure me the problem will be taken care of. 6 months later I ask for a refund because they are obviously not going to help me. Now Walmart says they're not going to do anything about the problem & I should blame Microsoft even though I purchased the cards through Walmart, which makes it Walmart's responsibility to activate the cards they sell.

You have no idea where they are being made and you have to go through the trouble of retuning items if the company offers returns. Well I'm sad to say that walmart.com is not a dependable website! The items I received were not Walmart quality at all! The items I received were NOT the items I ordered by any stretch of the imagination. They were just like the items I ordered from all the other websites! Chances are you're going to receive total crap! I want a website that is dependable. What you see is what you get.

Walmart needs to wake up, and realize they can lose the big name have created. Customer services for online purchases are going to destroy the company. American want to speak to people in the USA for better understanding not someone who is over seas that have no idea how Americans want to be treated. Over seas they have no idea of the laws in the USA, that here you can file a complain to Bureau of Consumer Protection. I had an issue with two item which didn't have a clear description I called for clarification; however, couldn't get it so I had to cancel the order by calling and getting a the call center over seas they told me it was from a third party vendor that I could call them cause they got no answer from Dec 6 to Dec 11, I was calling everyday to get a credit of about $300.00 taken from my debit card every single person I spoke to were lying to me cause I would find out when ask to read notes from the last person on the phone.

1313,43932,Steve,13/12/2020,Walmart,I shop regularly at Walmart and for the most part Iâ€™m happy with what I buy. But the check out is continuing to get worse. Today I should in line for 20 minutes to to buy approximately 20 items. When it was my turn the cashier flipped off her light and told me to go to the next line. I asked if she could ring me up please. She said no itâ€™s my break. I go to the back of the next line for 10 minutes before she flips of her light . Now Iâ€™m in the back of the third line with probably 10 carts in front. The lady before me said I seen what happened to you and that was so wrong. I ended up checking out myself but even that was a hassle to get someone to get bags for my grocery. Come on Walmart you have cornered the market during these uncertain covid times. Spend some of your millions to get more lanes open and better caliber workers to run your checkouts.

1317,43936,Yetta Lynn,13/12/2020,Walmart,I placed an order on 11/26/2020. I ordered a personalized blanket for my mom for Christmas. It was supposed to arrive on 12/4/2020. For whatever reason it has been sitting in New York since 12/6/2020. I have called twice to speak with customer service and I am getting nowhere. I do not want to cancel the order and reorder because I will not get it before Christmas. Iâ€™m so irritated. This is the 3rd bad experience with Walmart.com. It is not ok.
1318,43937,Steve Wolters,13/12/2020,Walmart,Purchased 6 items on December 1st all items were in stock. Today is December 13th items still not shipped. I hope I receive the Christmas gifts before Christmas. OMG the worst experience ðŸ˜« this year.
1319,43938,Kat,13/12/2020,Walmart,"Walmart Miami Supercenter #4161 9191 W. Flagler St, Miami, FL 33174 Incident Date - 12/12/2020  Let me begin with on December 10th at 2am we decided to camp out on this location for the next day drop of PS5 that were suppose to be coming in the next day. I was number 8 in line and was accompanied by number 9 in line. we camped out till the following morning around 3-4 we made friends with the people in front of us and made a camp out group. once the Manager Angel showed up he stated he wasnt even sure that there would be any at all of course we decided to stick to our guns and take our chances. it was either this or miss out on the chance of getting it for my nephew. its been a very hard year and quarantine has made things twice as hard, I didnt stand a chance vs the bots. I stayed away from my exclusivly breastfed baby for the chance. Well Angel kept walking in and out of the store speaking to another gentleman that had no Walmart shirt. After hours of waiting the truck arrives and Angel comes out to tell us he checked the list and the truck and there was not ONE PLAYSTATION. we stayed in hopes maybe some would pop up after 14 hours a couple more hours would hurt. UNTIL ANGEL CAME OUT AND TOLD WE COULD NOT STAY THERE AND THAT THERE WAS NO PLAYSTATION WE NEEDED TO GO TO OUR CARS. When one of the locals from our camp out group walked in for a reason not associated with the ps5 a regular employee advised him that they PUT OUT A COMPLETE PALLET OF PS5S AND OF COURSE SOLD OUT IMMEDIATLEY!!!  ANGEL MANAGER OF LOST PREVENTION SEEMS LIKE A THIEF AND COULD BE UP TO POSSIBLE FRAUD!! SEEMS LIKE WE FORCED US TO LEAVE TO CALL IN BUYERS OF HIS CHOOSING!!!!!  IS THIS HOW WALMART TREATS THEIR CUSTOMERS DURING THE HOLIDAYS AND QUARANTINE HARDSHIPS! TO MAKE IT WORST THE STORE MANAGER JOHNATHON IS AVOIDING MY CALLS AND CONTINUES TO HIDE!!! I REACHED OUT TO CORP AND MY NXT STEOP IS LOCAL NEW!"
1320,43939,Dj tripp,13/12/2020,Walmart,"Hello I am posting because of an experience I had at the Bemidji mn Walmart. Back in September I made a purchase and forgot 1 bag of 2 bottles of isopropyl rubbing alcohol. I realized what happened and called and Walmart found the bottles and put my name on a list in a book for when I return. Well after I went back to find there were no more and I checked every time I was there for 3 months and when they finally came in I brought to customer service and they could not find the book but found my receipt with the purchase and REFUSED to replace the bottles, and as I do go shopping for my work (not after this incident) it was hard to watch the 1 employee who knows I spend $400 a week for a treatment center not help or think that I am trying to scam Walmart out of $4.00. After employee refused to replace I called customer service who advised I had to call the store manager and of course I could not get a response just the run around. What really is hard for me is now is I will always go elsewhere however it comes at a more expensive cost but itâ€™s probably for the better as there are less people and better quality food at the other markets. Thanks for reading and do not forget no matter how small of a purchase or incident do not let a person or company blow you off when you know you have done right."
1321,43940,August B,13/12/2020,Walmart,Online inventory is false. Does not reflect whatâ€™s in the store. Trash website. With all the money they make youâ€™d think the website would be up to par.
1322,36166,466ereze,13/12/2018,Amazon Go,"Glimpses of future !! For all high tech geeks and for every layperson out there, if you wanna see the future, it is here and now.  Install a simple app, walk inside and walk out with anything you need.  I tested them out: took some stuff and returned and took again and put it back on a different shelf, grabbed few items together.... it works! You're billed for what you went out from the store with, only that.  Amazing Amazon. Long way since an online bookstore. Wow."
1323,41855,S.K.,13/12/2021,Walmart,"If you advertise a price, allow customers to purchase the item, then after all the sales have ended say the item is out of stock, and cancel the order - this is really bad business. Walmart - youâ€™ve done this to me too many times this holiday season. Online shopping elsewhere in the future. I would highly recommend others do the same."
1324,41856,John F,13/12/2021,Walmart,"Visited the local Walmart location this morning looking for a Spiral Ham for Christmas but ended up that they were sold out. When I first arrived I didn't see them anywhere so I asked the only employee I could find in that area and she looked at me like a ""deer in the headlights, and didn't have a clue what spiral ham was. She led me to the bunker with ham products and waved her hand like ""it must be one of these"". Nice guess but wrong! She said she was new working there so I asked to speak to someone else but I was informed that she was the only employee in that area. Came home and tried calling the store but the phone just rings and rings. Everyone is way too lazy and lethargic to bother wasting their energy to pick up the phone and actually assist a paying customer. I was self-employed for 23 years and I would have been out of business real fast if I ever had the audacity to treat my customers in such an unprofessional manner. Then I tried calling Walmart Head Office. They were absolutely zero help. The woman I spoke to directed my call to the same location where the phone just kept ringing. Had enough of their brand of crap to last me a lifetime. Guess nobody has told them that they actually do have competition with other grocery companies but I guess it's difficult to tell how things are going at ground level when you sit in your ivory tower day after day. I'll be shopping elsewhere from now on and doing the ""Price Matching"" at No Frills or Freshco. I'll still get your price without ever darkening your doorstep again. Thanks for nothing!!!"
1325,41857,Matthias otoo,13/12/2021,Walmart,"I made a purchase on my phone using the Walmart app, Honestly making the purchase was very easy ,however the arrival of my purchase was delayed for a week . I tried to reach out to the walmart help center and It took a long period to be attended to. Overall I think Walmart is a not a bad store to make purchases but come compared to other big fish in the game there are some aspect of Walmart's e-commerce which could use some improvement ."
1326,46917,Justin Laker,14/12/2018,Walmart,Long lines at check out. Cashiers move slower then slow with a minute per item as the twirl flip it looking for the barcode. The scan yourself registers are empty with the worker chasing the customer because if 20 items or less rule. When told to leave the check out a woman shouted back and the lines have 30 f'ing people in them and cashiers are slow as s*it.
1327,45886,Lisa Plaza,14/12/2019,Walmart,Horrible...I order an item more than two weeks before Christmas as a gift for my son. The estimated time for delivery WAS the 15th of December. The 15th came and went and no item. I reached out to be told I could not get it until after Xmas. Then they gave me a promo code that did not work. Told me I could pay for expedited shipping of 35.00 even though the email they sent me said they would pay for the expedited shipping if it necessary. But no they couldn't do that either. So I basically could not get my son the item he wanted for Christmas because by the time I was informed they could not ship on time I could not order from anywhere else. Thanks Walmart! for you customer solution team that provides no solutions.
1328,45887,Dylan Baxter,14/12/2019,Walmart,"Ordering online for in store pickup is a joke. I bought one switch pro controller, 5 hours later itâ€™s still not ready to be picked up. Save yourself the hassle. Just go to the store to get it, donâ€™t order for in store pickup."
1329,45888,MILO,14/12/2019,Walmart,"I will never shop at Walmart again. Just finished my Christmas shopping. Spent 250 more of my hard earned dollars there and got treated like a thief as I left. I was stopped by the door staff and every thing that was not in a bag had to be checked.i think maybe Walmart should supply some bigger bags instead of harassing me with their door check policy. Lost a valuable customer great job. I guess it will make more room for the pajama wearing,food stamp spending customers that are probably the one that actually do steal."
1330,45889,Andrea Hollowell,14/12/2019,Walmart,"Ordering from Walmart.com turned into a nightmare for me. I ordered a twin size bed at a great price....but, turns out, that great price cost me hours of frustration and time trying to get my order! After being mistreated, and disrespected by customer service, and the management - the end result was that I ended up demanding a refund, since there was no way I could actually RECEIVE my item! Never, EVER will I, or my family order from Walmart.com again. After all said and done, Walmart.com sent me a survey, and I found it funny that one of the questions asked if I was an Amazon Prime member...well, the answer to that is, YES. And, thank god!"
1331,45890,amanda wilson,14/12/2019,Walmart,Walmart in Henderson Texas has been extremely understanding with my autistic son. Love going there
1332,45891,Alishcia Badia,14/12/2019,Walmart,"I was transferred five times, I was on hold the 45mins I was on the phone with Walmart representatives. Not a single one including this women named Jaylen did not know what they were doing and how to solve the issue. She put me on hold for another 13mins only to end the call by transferring me to the end of call survey. Very dissatisfied with how Walmart treats customers. Walmart should really review who they hire and insure that at least one department has the knowledge required to assist on call. I requested to speak to a manager and or supervisor but was denied the opportunity. I am going to call back tomorrow because Walmart owes me money due to an error on there behalf. An online order was placed money was taken 150$ worth from my gift cards, the system had a glitched therefore emailed me back saying I wouldnâ€™t recieve my order. Its been over a week when I was told it would take 24hrs to receive my money back."
1333,45892,Vinnie,14/12/2019,Walmart,"Walmart took a turn the wrong lane in the late 90s, when they actually employed useful workers that helped people buy things. Niw, they are hiring uselessness for some kinda government corrupt kickback. This I s why I stopped buying from Walmart, because you can't find anyone to help you!!!!"
1334,45893,Cindy Brose,14/12/2019,Walmart,"For my company Iâ€™ve ordered on Walmart.com numerous times. I have had so many billing issues. The receipt never matches the invoice online, no one can give me a straight answer they keep giving me the same email with the same response but has nothing to do with the question I asked. Itâ€™s happened over and over again. Being in a business my receipts have to match exact to my credit card purchases. That seems to be a real struggle with Walmart. Itâ€™s been happening now for two years. I stopped ordering from them now. And my company has gone elsewhere."
1335,45894,Dan McG,14/12/2019,Walmart,"I ordered an LG TV from Walmart.com on Cyber Monday (Dec 2). Was to be delivered on Dec 4th. The TV was a gift for my daughter's birthday on Dec 7. On Dec 4th, I checked the status and saw the TV would delayed until Dec 6th. On the 7th, the TV was in a distribution center 10 miles away, and was suppose to be available for pickup by ""end of day."" On the 9th, I called the local store and they said it was ""in transit."" On the 10th, I called the local store and they said it would be ready for pickup by 6 pm. BTW, at no time was I contacted by Walmart, either by phone or email. I initiated all communication with Walmart.  On the 11th, I contacted Walmart.com customer service. The woman apologized, and said she was cancelling the original order, putting in a new one and she assured me it would be available for pickup on Dec 13th. She never explained what happened to the original order. On the morning of the 13th, the status said it would be delivered by end of day. Later that day, the status said it would be delivered by end of day on December 17th.  I cancelled the order. Went to Best Buy, got a TV. Will never, ever shop online at Walmart.com again."

You made my day and helped to ensure that my children would have a great Christmas this year."
1337,43927,Ghufran Khan,14/12/2020,Walmart,"Worst experience ever!! I ordered something which got delayed for one week without telling me ANY reason. I asked the agent to cancel it, which he did. I went on and bought the item by myself. Next day I reached them out again to confirm that is my order cancelled to which she said sorry it can't be cancelled and it was a mistake that the agent told you so last time!!!! Like seriously!!! I spend almost 100 dollars to go and buy the items and now you are saying me that I will still be charged for my last order!!! What kind of service is this??"
1338,43928,Two Curlz,14/12/2020,Walmart,I purchased led lights for myself. They came in 2 weeks late. On top of that when I got it the sticky side of the lights were not sticky and falling off my wall instantly. I am really disappointed with Walmartâ€™s service with me. This is not acceptable. I am furious with my order.
1339,43929,Becky,14/12/2020,Walmart,"Every time I purchase a specific item online, it's not available. You need to order more than just a handful, because I'm not the only one who stocks up on it. Coffee mate chocolate coffee creamer. You need to order way more than 6 for your store. I only get 1 because there are not any more. Plenty of other creamers. Maybe order less of those and more of the one I like."
1340,43930,Sentanni,14/12/2020,Walmart,"Disappointing!  Why would I waste my time shopping only to go for check out and get a message : ""Weâ€™re sorry! All times are currently booked. Please continue checking back - new time slots open up throughout the day."
1341,41843,Jackson Vose,14/12/2021,Walmart,You have two options of ordering a new generation gaming console from Walmart:  1) Pay double the price to buy from a shady reseller 2) Purchase a useless Walmart+ subscription only to have your order be delayed by several weeks (hopefully not months). I placed my order on 12/8 and it was supposed to arrive today. Now it says it will arrive 12/23 (and I'm not going to hold my breath). I will be out of town by then and there is no option to change the delivery address and I've been on hold with the useless customer service forever. Avoid Walmart at all costs.
1342,41844,Carole Holliday,14/12/2021,Walmart,Excellent in every way. OVERNIGHT DELIVERY!!!
1343,41845,SHAILESH GOHEL,14/12/2021,Walmart,It is very poor and bad service experienced from walmart online i booked air fryer on 24th november and today 14th december still there is no any status updated about delivery or shipment as well i talked three times with helpline number and they only told everytime it will take 48 hours to chek your case .
1344,41846,esther ginsberg,14/12/2021,Walmart,terrible horrible service made an order sunday paid for express delivery its tuesday and i still did not get it very disappointed and noone to talk to
1345,41847,Michael gabriel,14/12/2021,Walmart,If there was a option on giving them negative stars they have so earned it over customer service and price matching lets give Wal-Mart.com a round of applause they just lost a big order congrats
1346,41848,customer,14/12/2021,Walmart,They have a lousy way of treating customers. Iâ€™ve ordered several orders over the past year online and I have had 3 or 4 orders that never showed up small orders and I find out tonight Walmart just closed my online account they said Iâ€™ve misused the return policy and they say I canâ€™t order anything else online from them when itâ€™s their terrible service when they send some of your stuff from a local Walmart and the driver either doesnâ€™t show up or brings the wrong items so they are saying itâ€™s my fault and that Iâ€™m a liar.I have spent a lot of money with Walmart online They are a terrible company and I will spend my money else where like Amazon or Target somewhere that doesnâ€™t treat their customers like trash.
1347,41849,Stephanie Pitchford,14/12/2021,Walmart,I placed an order on Black Friday. Two items a controller and a purse. The controller I got was the wrong color. I contacted them they said it was sold by a market place seller wait 48 hours for them to contact you. So I did and nothing I contact walmart again. They say we'll you can return in and reorder it I said then I lose the sale price. They say we'll yeah we can't do anything about that. So my only options are keep it and deal with it or return it and reorder it and pay full price. Wow! Second item on the same order I still haven't received there hasn't been an update since the 8th. I again contact Walmart and they say. Its in transit so you can't cancel continue to wait and I can start a refund once I get the item. I say we'll what if I don't get the item until after Christmas considering it's a gift. The while time writing this review the rep still hasn't answered my question.
1348,41850,Tina Callisto,14/12/2021,Walmart,"I'm reviewing the Walmart.com online customer service and the gift card team. Worst service ever. I attempted to purchase US gift cards from Canada and the orders kept getting canceled. After about 10 calls, with numerous transfers and several confirmations that the problem was solved the problem is still not resolved and I am still faced with the same problem. Hope they get their issues resolved, they've lost my business."
1349,41851,Robert Corsi,14/12/2021,Walmart,"I am reviewing the Walmart store near me in Woodland park Colorado. It is located in 19600 US-24, Woodland Park, CO 80863. I wanted to thank the staff for going out of their way to service me when I had a hard time getting things out to my car last Sunday. This is a really great store."
1350,41852,James Hill,14/12/2021,Walmart,"If I could give negative stars I would. This is the biggest joke around. I purchased a large item that can freight and not only did it arrive 4 days late but completely wrong item. Not one person that works there speaks plain English and Walmart corporate is just as bad. Wrong item and then it becomes your problem to get it back to them with no definite time for a replacement. This side of Walmart should be shut down in my opinion. Just looking at the reviews here says a lot. Screw any and every Walmart, they will no longer have my business."
1351,41853,Robert Hall,14/12/2021,Walmart,"I ordered 13 canvas photo wall hangings to give to sponsors and board members of the non-profit where I work. 1. I purchased the items on November 23. I picked them up on November 24. Most of them were poorly constructed. I had them try to fix several, and picked those up on November 27. Some still werenâ€™t acceptable AND others couldnâ€™t be reproduced because the order had already expired in their system. I was advised to cancel the entire order and get my money back. I was also advised to order online again for a shipping option because the production would be made by a machine instead of people so would look better. 2. I reordered a second time as advised on November 27 (Order# 8601212095201) 3. I then called Walmart.com and cancelled the original order. They provided a bar code and advised me to take the original items back to the Elizabethton Walmart (#690). 4. I took the items back to the local Walmart store and dealt with customer service. When the rep scanned the bar code, it said no order found and then the bar code disappeared. We tried for 90 minutes with me standing at customer service trying to get this resolved including Walmart.com hanging up on the local csr. 5. Finally, a local employee, a man named Brandon, got through to someone and told me I would be reimbursed. He said he would hold onto the returned items for a few days and then dispose of it because it was canvas photos specific to my company. They were now basically trash. 6. Iâ€™ve communicated with customer care at Walmart.com regularly since 11/27 with no resolution. They want proof I took the items back, and there is none. All I can tell you is that I received the new order, which Iâ€™m keeping, and want to be reimbursed for the order I returned. Itâ€™s not my fault I donâ€™t have paperwork. I did everything I was asked to do. I followed the instructions of the local customer service folks...exactly. I followed the instructions of the walmart.com folks...Now, I'm being taken full circle and being told to get the local store to reimburse my non-profit and also to reach out to Walmart.com's phone customer service (the same place that hung up on one of their own customer service folks trying to help me. I am trapped on a highway with no exit ramps."
1352,41854,nah,14/12/2021,Walmart,literally the meanest f**cking people i have ever had an encounter with. Saw an employee yelling at his coworker very aggressively and loud. He called him â€œf**king a**holeâ€ infront of the customers. Then my friend had an accident and spilled her coffee and got some of the rudest responses. We ended up having to go to the restroom and grab paper towels and clean it up ourselves because the employees were being so rude and no help. We even had to put up a wet floor sign so no one would slip. Screw Walmart in Carmel Indiana on Greyhound pass.

1354,47139,rl s,15/12/2017,Walmart,After experience in the Center Texas store the other day I'm afraid to buy any food from any store or online anymore. I was in the Center Texas Walmart the other day and a woman had her dog and the dog was putting his nose all over the produce and an employ doesnt say a thing to her. Im sure u cant be sued for telling the dog owner to keep the dogs mouth and nose away from the food!Dogs put their nose in filthy places so why would u want it on your food. GROSS.
1355,46916,Ernest Blake,15/12/2018,Walmart,"Terrible, just terrible! Not enough people at checkout registers to handle the shoppers. We have decided that because we have plenty of retail and grocery stores close to us, we will no longer be utilizing Wal-Mart in the future. We have publix ( which has plenty of BOGO'S and target, steinmart, dollar store and dollar tree, not to mention many more, which are close to us."
1356,45882,Jaida Smith,15/12/2019,Walmart,Walmart is just your typical store with mediocre products and dirty bathrooms. It always smells bad in the store and the employees always look mad. The only good thing about Walmart is itâ€™s cheap prices but thatâ€™s because it sells cheap products.
1357,45883,diana,15/12/2019,Walmart,I ordered marble plates...they delivered floral plates. I went to the store to return the item and was told I cannot have a refund....2 weeks passed still no refund. Worse online shopping experience ever. Outdated.
1358,45884,Stalin Quiterio,15/12/2019,Walmart,I had a very good experience with their services. thank you very much for your attention and time
1359,45885,Amy Wu,15/12/2019,Walmart,"Very bad experience, I will never order anything from Walmart .com again. I ordered an iPhone XR on November 27 with the Black Friday deal. it went through and got an email confirmation with a tracking number. on the delivery date December 4, I did not receive my phone instead I received another email saying my phone was returned. But the device was never shipped , Walmart was unable to show me any shipping record. A second email from Walmart said my phone got returned and I got refunds.To make things worse, Walmart so far has not informed AT&T about the cancellation, and that makes my phone not eligible to upgrade . I called 3 times and couldnâ€™t get the problem solved. I lost my Black Friday deal and I am loosing todayâ€™s One day sale deal at Samâ€™s all because I used Walmart.com"
1360,43918,Jason Sanson,15/12/2020,Walmart,"Walmart.com is horrible. These Xbox consoles are sold and then You get an email that itâ€™s been cancelled. If you add it to your cart and pay for it, itâ€™s ridiculous that they cancel it after you have paid. I ordered mine at 3:00 and it was cancelled. However someone else can order at 3:40 and not be cancelled. Just a horrible way to run a business in my opinion!!!"
1361,43919,Robert,15/12/2020,Walmart,I purchased Walmart + and it worked well for a while. More recently I find I have to wait several days for delivery. Not worth it when there are good services available from others.
1362,43920,Karen Moltrup,15/12/2020,Walmart,Etters Pa Walmart 12/14/2020 in store purchases. These were all stocking stuffers 31 items total $131.69. Checked the items the next morning 2 items were missing. Called the store 4 times put on hold - was hung up on - trying to speak with the manager never came to the phone. Two calls the person answering didn't speak English! Our family spends money twice a week at that store. Seems like no one answering the phone cared about the service that they could have provided. We will be using Weis or Giant from now on.
1363,43921,Michelle,15/12/2020,Walmart,"I have ordered 4 times since the pandemic and my experience has been going down hill most orders are delivered in separate packages over several days. I have had issues with crushed interior boxes, wet exterior boxes, oil/grease on exterior boxes, filthy/ grimy interior bags, and ripped interior bags with contents spilled throughout box. when dealing with food, I am not comfortable consuming food from ""opened"" ""crushed"" or ""filthy/ grimy"" packages. Its unfortunate that such a needed service has such poor performance issues. I most cases, the exterior packaging was not damaged, so have to believe that the person filling the order was well aware of inferior goods being sent out to customers resulting in returns and poor customer reviews and experiences. I will not be able to order food from Walmart.com again, since I have lost trust in their ability to provide food in edible condition. Now I must repackage and drop off to a facility to return the items, which is impossible for me since I am high risk and will not go inside any building and talk to any person for any reason. Sad and upset with myself that I gave them another shot at getting it right. For your own sake/sanity, limit or forgo food items when ordering for delivery."
1364,43922,Holly Findlay,15/12/2020,Walmart,"I ordered a Hanukkah gift from the Walmart website November 28th to make sure I received it on time. It was supposed to be here yesterday, 12/14. I waited over two weeks to receive this item and I then receive an email saying that it was delayed. I contacted customer service, which is severally lacking in professionalism. I felt like I was talking to a robot, but they said it was a live agent. She then blamed the company Melissa and Doug where the product was coming from and said it was no fault of theirs that the order was not delivered on time. The agent then said after further review the order had been lost entirely in transit and that once again was not the fault of Walmart. I ordered it through them and think they should take responsibility if a product is not delivered. The spelling and helpfulness of this agent was atrocious. They then kept repeating if I wanted it resent or refunded. I asked when it would get here by and they responded January 5th. I made this order at the end of November and I wouldnâ€™t receive it until January. I just found this whole experience to be terrible. If they canâ€™t guarantee shipping/delivery they should not sell this item on their website. They kept blaming the other company and I asked since this was in fact Walmartâ€™s fault if I could get the order expedited to ensure I received it before the end of Hanukkah. She just said no, that she would refund it. One of the worst experiences Iâ€™ve ever had with a company. I assure you I will never shop here again. Now days before the end of Hanukkah I have to scramble to get a gift. Since they did not communicate with me about this issue I canâ€™t look online to find another gift. Horrible customer service, terrible company and overall very very unsatisfied with what happened with this order. I hope others will learn from my experience and not shop at Walmart."

She should also probably not lie and say I will transfer you to billing and they will get you your money back now and resolve your issues, because that cleary was not going to happen billing just repeated the same ""thats walmarts policy"" over and over again with nothing new too say or any more information. None of this is really their fault either its all walmarts fault for having poor policies to handle customer refunds for items canceled by WALMART, for having a website that says something is in stock and then letting the order go through and charging the person money only to email that person four hours later saying sorry we don't actually have that item but your money will be refunded automatically only to let them find out that automatically actually means 3 to 5 buisness days. And I get that mistakes happen every once in awhile and it would be all fine but out of the 5 online orders I have placed for instore pickup in the last month 4 of them were canceled thats a 20% success rate, good job walmart. And on top of that one of the itmes I ordered that was canceled because it was out of stock was not actually out of stock there was about 25 them sitting on the shelf when I went in 20 minutes after I got the cancelation email and when I asked customer service about it they called the person up that goes and picks that stuff up and they said oh yeah that item is out of stock I went and looked my self (while I am holding said item in my hand in their store) then.when I said you have like 25 of them sitting back there he said oh well sorry must have missed them. Poor customer service all around, poor policies, poor website, and 2 of walmarts employees lied directly to my face. Would give you negative stars if I could."
1366,43924,April Ramos,15/12/2020,Walmart,I bought a gift card from Walmart.com but never received it because FedEx admittedly lost the package. Walmart passed me around for a month and still hasnâ€™t resolved the issue. They promised a refund or replacement but it never happened. No one at customer service can help. Money down the drain.
1367,43925,Michelle Allen,15/12/2020,Walmart,"CAUTION TO PEOPLE - DO NOT PURCHASE ANY GIFT CARDS FROM WALMART - the visa gift cards they sell cannot be used anywhere, online or in store - they will basically just steal your money  I IPURCHASED YOUR PIECE OF garbage GIFT CARDS - $10000 WORTH AND THEY AND YOU ARE WORTHLESS. i WILL BE TARNISHING YOUR REPUTATION ONLINE AT EVERY POSSIBLE LOCATION UNTIL YOU ALLOW ME TO REGISTER AND USE THESE GIFT CARDS THAT I PURCHASED. CANT MAKE A PURCHASE IN PERSON, OR ONLINE, ALREADY REGISTERED THE CARDS ONCE AND NOW CANNOT USE THE CARD ANYWHERE. I AM NOT ABLE TO REGISTER THEM ONLINE AGAIN â€“ AND THEY ARE TOTALLY WORTHLESS AND SO IS YOUR COMPANY. YOU BASICALLY JUST STOLE 10k DOLLARS FROM ME. HOPE YOU ROT IN HELL."
1368,36409,Zahra M.,15/12/2019,Amazon Go,"Amazon Go, an innovative concept that lets customers have an incredible experience, without any human interaction. The technology is very impressive and accurate. You must have the Amazon Go app prior to entry. You scan your QR code on a machine and then enter the store. You pick anything off the shelf, and it's charged to your Amazon account. Don't help someone by handing them an item; it will be charged to your account instead of theirs. The shelves items are limited and everything is pre-packaged. You can't get produce here. You can't vlog here but you can use your camera. I can't wait this is the norm with more selection and on a larger scale."
1369,36141,rickgN2491RP,15/12/2021,Amazon Go,small selection but interesting concept Only those registered with credit cards on file will be able to into stores. You will sign in using your phone. You merely pick up things as the cameras and sensors know what you've taken and leave. One minute later you are charged. Millions of people are now out of work.
1370,47350,Peter Doyle,16/12/2013,Walmart,Love shopping at walmart. I can really stay all day if i could. The price is good and the employess are helpful

1372,47141,Bill Brand,16/12/2017,Walmart,"WALMARTS on line ordering is a scam, they always try to manipulate you to come into the store to pick up or buy things a bit cheaper in the store. Basically, all I order are soaps and cleaning products , things that are always in stock, yet very difficult to get online at the best price.  Online orders are never shipped on time or complete .. They seem to always say that 1 simple thing in your order is only available in the store to get you in the store to buy more .  My last order was their ""1 box"" shipping price but they shipped from 3 different locations and i still havent received the 3Rd box. It's not worth my time to try and save money order g from them online , when I would come out cheaper in the store as long as i dont buy extra stuff .GET IT, that's what they want you to do!!!  Update. . It's now been 2 weeks since the order was placed for cleaning products . The 3rd box has never been received. When I go on the Walmart site to check tracking, FEDEX advises (on Walmarts site) that the package was undeliverable and damaged , and to contact the shipper (Walmart). You would think that Walmart would automatically fix this but NO....It's Walmart and I have to waste my time   I've looked all over their site and spent an hr trying to find a way to notify them it was never received and cannot find any way to let them known and get a credit issued or replaced.  Seeing as there prices are higher on line and they make it so difficult to deal with, there is simply no advantage to ordering on line that I can see. It's way to difficult, takes so much time and tough to determine if you are saving any money .  IT HAS TO BE THEIR ON LINE MARKETING BUSINESS PLAN  I not here to promote another online ordering service, but if this is their attempt to compete with Amazon they failed miserably."
1373,46915,Evan Watkins,16/12/2018,Walmart,One star is too high for the trouble we had w/the automotive tire service department at walmart #04065. We purchased two new tires had to go back next day b/c on of tires was losing air. Waited three hours to be told they would not replace defective tire b/c it had a puncture in it and that was our fault. Bull crap....Talked to Assistant Store Manager he did nothing basically said it was our fault and we caused the puncture. The only thing he could do was give us a new tire but charge us road hazard fee. WTH....Walmart you will not receive our business in automotive and we will not recommend you to anyone. You need to provide better service and better products.
1374,45877,Malinda Lenz,16/12/2019,Walmart,"My review has to do with Walmart.com I placed and order on Nov. 29th, and they canceled it due to they could not verify it was me, well if you don't call and even try to verify it is someone you can't verify it is. Than I spend two days trying to get it settled and reordered they say they will give me a 10.00 coupon off my next order and never receive it, they say I will get my order before Christmas and I don't get all of it because one thing is on back order, and they other is on a delay and won't receive it until the day after out Christmas is over so my granddaughter won't have it before. Than they say I will get it for the same price I ordered it for the first time and no I did not only on a few of the items. I tell them that and they say I will fix it, and they never did. I am VERY VERY UPSET WITH WALMART.COM. I even kept the conversations we had and printed them out. I will take them into the store closest to me after I receive my items and I hope they do something about it or I would advice people to not order online through there. Their customer service was very poor they did not follow through with anything they said they would and yet said they were sorry and their service was better than this if I had a way to post our conversation I would so do!!!!! Just to show how poor it is and how wrong they were and how they don't keep their word!!"
1375,45878,Tim Tyree,16/12/2019,Walmart,Donâ€™t order on line. Their shipping is unreliable and you will never get to talk to a human
1376,45879,Lucy Gonzalez,16/12/2019,Walmart,"I'm having the worst experience ever with these freaking people!  I misread the delivery date which was my fault. I ordered a refrigerator. (Which people need.) First, I called the shipping company. Cuz it stated ""shipped"" but wasn't being updated. They stated that a label created but wasn't shipped yet. So, I called Walmart customer service. They told it wasn't going to be shipped for another 3 weeks. So, I cancelled the ordered. Now, today I'm calling to verify that my ordered was cancelled. I was advised that my order was shipped out and they couldn't process my return until it was shipped back. I had already told them my situation and they decided to process my order anyway w/o my permission. Spoke to Jean the Supervisor. It was already shipped out. It's on it's way to me. My anxiety was still high. I called the shipping company to verify. They received it yesterday. It's stressful dealing with Walmart. If you can't wait on your shipment. My advice is to go someplace else."
1377,45880,Jean Preston,16/12/2019,Walmart,I tried for the first time to do grocery shopping and have them delivered to my house. Bad idea! They â€œaccidentallyâ€ canceled the order. Waiting for refund in 24-48hrs. I knew it was too good to be true.
1378,43911,Abriana Campbell,16/12/2020,Walmart,it is good to go there and buy all the stuff that you like but it is always crowded and I wish people would stay apart.
1379,43912,Patricia,16/12/2020,Walmart,I ordered two items online. Both as Christmas gifts. One for an adult. And one for a child ( toy barn set). I received the adult item. Then received an email saying the toy barn is on back order. Why on earth would they allow you to place an order for a item they don't have in stock specially at Christmas. If this toy don't come by Christmas I'm going to have a very upset grandchild seeing as to this is the Santa gift. So if it don't come... Thanks Wal-Mart for destroying my grandchilds Christmas and belief in Santa. This was my first time shopping online through Wal-Mart and will be my last. Will stick to companies that run they're websites better.
1380,43913,Peter Rubas,16/12/2020,Walmart,"Purchased a TV online at Walmart.com for the first time with guaranteed delivery by Thanksgiving. TV arrived unexpectedly 4 days AFTER Thanksgiving and the delivery guy knocks on my door trying to carry a 65 inch TV by himself. Well, the delivery guy must have dropped the TV because after I spent hours installing the TV, it did not work. So I have been trying to return this broken TV and get my money back since it arrived and now it is December 16th, I still have a broken 65 inch TV boxed up sitting in my living room, the scheduled pick-up's for the return never came, I had to go out and buy another TV locally and I am still out over $700.00 because they will not refund me until they get the TV back. Be aware, this can happen to you too."
1381,43914,Jason Holland,16/12/2020,Walmart,Funny how back in May Walmart limited me to buying only 1 PlayStation gift card because of the pandemic but they allow bots to buy all of the PS5s they what right before Christmas!!!!!????? They either don't give a dam about people or they haven't got the slightest idea of what they are doing!! How pathetic you are! Walmart you are the most hypocritical scum on the earth and should be ashamed of yourselves. Only care about the $!! Cooperate scum! Would leave 0 stars if possible.

1384,43917,Charles A,16/12/2020,Walmart,"It's always been and still is a low-class store, but I didn't initially judge it on that. I will say, the store had a wide selection and range of items to choose from; of course, not superb quality but excellent for the retail price. Though, its ""inclusive"" advertisements and other trifles like their ads are disappointing but understandable. That is after all their demographic, so it's a strategic marketing maneuver. Overall, they make sense. 7/10."
1385,36165,jimf645,16/12/2018,Amazon Go,"Glimpses of future !! The geek side of me just had to check this place out. Basically a convenience store/quick meals store where they don't have a checkout! That's right, you download an app, tap on the way in to identify yourself, and then just take what you want and leave. You can scan guests in as well. Sensors determine what you take and you get the bill a few minutes after leaving. We took things for a snack/lunch, put them back, took them again and passed them to each other and then just walked out the door with most of the stuff in our pockets. A few minutes later the bills came on the app. Everything was correct and attached to the right person."
1386,36342,Hector P.,16/12/2018,Amazon Go,"Definitely a must try and glimpse into the future of shopping. Make sure to download the AmazonGo app on your device before getting in.

1387,47137,Carolyn Albers,17/12/2017,Walmart,"I recently went to Walmart w/ the shopping list. Not a single employee knew where the items were. Imagine buying a plastic tub, then asking ""where does one find the top?"". Oh, ""the top is on isle 16, but the bottom is now on isle 12"". Only seeking 5 items it took the assistant manager 4 hours to help me find the items. Now they are in a bag w/ the receipt to return. The best time to shop there is @ midnight, as the store is empty.Good fortune to whomever shops there."
1388,46913,Demi Taylor,17/12/2018,Walmart,"Just stay away from Wal-Mart. With all the other shopping centers out there, no reason to give your hard earned money to them. Terrible customer service!!!

1389,46914,Kay Newberry,17/12/2018,Walmart,"My experience was TERRIBLE!! I CAME IN on a Sunday with 2 flat tires. Told them we seen a hole in 1. They said they fixed it, we took it home. Got up the next morning with the same 2 flats! Took it back having to miss work! They said they replaced valve stems, just to find out later they DID NOT!! I have been here since 7am & at almost 10:00 I see them raise my car in the air just starting to work on it! This is crazy!"
1390,45871,Lori Beth Day,17/12/2019,Walmart,"I just got off the phone with a customer service manager.  My issue, after talking with 5 different reps, was that my photo order got ""lost"". All they wanted to do was refund my money. I was supposed to have received this YESTERDAY. I'm a photographer and my client needed these to be delivered by then. Now, I have to spend more than double the money that I used to order these photos, double the amount of time to order them all again and get the sizing correct, and frustration of talking to many reps on the phone and not having anything get done besides refunding my money...not to mention having to go to the store and pick these photos up and deliver them to the client rather than them being mailed which was what I paid for in the first place. Through no fault of my own, all of this could have been helped if they would have just given me the difference of $7.20 (don't even care about the fuel cost to drive to the store then to get back to the clients residence) but no, all i'm offered is a refund that won't even be processed for 5-7 business days. Not so great customer service if you ask me."
1391,45873,Michele Russell,17/12/2019,Walmart,I have had so many issues were to begin. 1) every time I buy fruit by time I get home I find that the middle of what I bought has mold. 2) the selection of foods on the shelf are limited. 3) trying to call and get a person on the phone is impossible I called 5 times in 20 minutes no one is answering. 3) the manager in person are rude to employees and shoppers. 4) when you need assistance in store there is no one around. 5) all the line a that are open are to long because the cashiers seem to have gotten slower with the machines being installed.
1392,45874,J.Nash,17/12/2019,Walmart,I ordered tires. Waited 6 days only to be told they're not arriving. My appointment for installation was the day after they were to arrive. Called day of appointment to learn the order got lost in transit. Winter storm coming...no money...no tires! Never again... I'll stick with Amazon!!
1393,45875,Joe,17/12/2019,Walmart,"I am so disappointed with a purchase from a Walmart ""Trusted Seller"" that I will never order online from Walmart any more. I purchased a game system on cyber Monday for my 9-year old son for Christmas. I assumed that Walmart would stand behind what they sell, regardless if it is from them or one of their sellers. Just over a week before Christmas I got a notice that my package was delivered but when I got home it was nowhere to be found. It turns out that it was delivered to a storage locker in Colorado (I live in Massachusetts). That's fine, mistakes happen. When I called Walmart they assured me that they would research it and I would hear back within 24 hours. Three days later I called them again and was told that seller is no longer on their site and I would be refunded the money. Now I'm a week until Christmas and I missed the chance to find it at Cyber Monday prices if I can find one at all. I'm not sure what Walmart means by ""trusted seller"" but I do know that Walmart cannot be counted on to do the right thing."
1394,45876,Faaaaa,17/12/2019,Walmart,"First of all am frustrated with Walmart online shopping because I bought a Samsung tv and a wall mount ok long story short I get a email saying that the items were going to be shipped separately so after sending one item which is the mount which I receive and signed for, and i was Patiently waiting for my tv and here goes Walmart saying it was delivered, it was delivered and is no way I could reach to customer service"
1395,43899,Butch Jones,17/12/2020,Walmart,Walmart Tracking is horrible. They are dishonest about the delivery dates. Use Amazon!
1396,43900,Melissa N Justin Taylor,17/12/2020,Walmart,"Very, very, very bad customer service. Spoke with the supervisor on duty and she just sat on the phone. Nothing she could do but refund my order She barely even spoke. Only one woman (Rowen) was able to solve my problem and that's after speaking to multiple people for over a week, and after speaking to the supervisor. Good luck if you have any problems with your walmart.com orders."
1397,43901,Ann Oleneck,17/12/2020,Walmart,"Warning do NOT buy from Walmart.com they partner with very shady fraudulent companies. Most of the companies are third party. After the third party says it shipped your item, charges your card ( and the cancelled the shipping) then Walmart.com will not even help you get your money back. Never buy from them!"
1398,43902,KC Czech,17/12/2020,Walmart,Kind of sad to say that Walmart is rated average in this day and age. Most of the customer service folks have been pleasant and helpful once you find one. I am very saddened by their selling so much crap from China and some other foreign countries that are untrustworthy. I get that it is all about the dollar but I do not agree with this policy.
1399,43903,Unhappy Consumer,17/12/2020,Walmart,"I was never able to purchase this item to be able give a review. I went to 3 different stores where this item was suppose to have been ""in stock"". Instead upon getting there I found this exact item, with an entirely different sku number which registered a higher price. Exact being of same color, size, dimensions, make and model number. Beware people this is case of ""BAIT AND SWITCH"". Only advertising this item online as ""pick up only"" and upon getting to the store instead of finding the advertised item you find the same item at a higher price and not willing to either honor the advertised price or option to even place the order online and then pick it up to ensure you stick to your budget and not waste gas driving to different stores unnecessarily or to have it delivered.  Bait-and-switch is a form of FRAUD USED IN RETAIL SALES but also employed in other contexts. First, customers are ""baited"" by merchants' advertising products or services at a low price, but when customers visit the store, they discover that the advertised goods are not available, or the customers are pressured by salespeople to consider similar, but higher-priced items (""switching"").  Bait-and-switch techniques have a long and widespread history as a part of commercial culture and is used more heavily around holiday times.  This practice si very disturbing to me. I needed ans still need 4 of these bins for organizing my house on the budget in which I set out to spend. So now I have to search for this item elsewhere preferably at the same price or maybe slightly slightly higher.  I only leave this review because of the inconvenience of not being able to actually purchase what was advertised and wasting time and gas going to other stores that claimed to have then in stock when indeed they did not. Which in turn pissed me off. Now my project has to take longer than my initial projected time.  Item: Sterilite 30-Gallon Tote Box Walmart # 550367700  BEWARE CONSUMERS! BEWARE!!!!!!!!!

1400,43904,Tracy Burns Burns,17/12/2020,Walmart,I ordered Christmas gifts for children on the Salvation Army Angel Tree Program. I was assured they would arrive 2 days ago. Nothing so far and all I am told is they are out for delivery. They are due to be turned in this evening. I have gone to purchase more things so these children will have something under their trees. The feeling I get is Walmart simply doesn't care.
1401,43905,Terry Stencel,17/12/2020,Walmart,"Be aware of Wal-Martâ€™s shipping/delivery policy. I ordered 2 PillowPets at different times, just two weeks apart, as Christmas gifts. They were ordered in plenty of time for delivery. I confirmed my delivery address. Wal-Mart/FedEx delivered my packages to the wrong address twice. When I contacted Wal-Mart stating that I received delivery emails but no packages, I was told that someone had signed for the package. I was also informed that I would be charged for the packages and I would have to contact my bank to dispute the charges. Wal-Martâ€™s customer service rep told me that there wasnâ€™t anything Wal-Mart could do to help resolve my problem. Be aware that Wal-Martâ€™s delivery policy is very poor. Amazon will be my choice!!"
1402,43906,Joyce G,17/12/2020,Walmart,"I was at store 1213. I have never been humiliated. I am an assistant manager at retail. And this kind of behavior with customer service is one of the most horrible place I have been to. The name of the manager was Miss Camila. The assistant store manager was rude on the phone and was racist towards what I had mention. I did not say anything about race. And he mentions india???? His name was Rahjin he did not provide us he last name as he refused. The cashier on number 3 named sharmdeep was so rude as he is talking his language to other associates and they are just laughing at us. Miss camila was so rude dis not explain or say why she made us wait 20 mins then just say i""I am not giving you that for that price"". And then rushed so fast. I will keep writing this kind of this review until this gets handled. I believe in good customer service and I was not rude at all both managers were so rude on the telephone. I was trying to explain myself and they were both were not listnening. How do you guys hire people with this kind of customer services. I was with my daughter and our experience"
1403,43907,David Quinlan,17/12/2020,Walmart,"I ordered my product weeks ago, got a notification that the package was delivered, and though I was home all day with my door open, did not receive my package. 3 other packages made it to me just fine that day, so I called customer service to get the item replaced or resent. Customer service was the worst Iâ€™ve ever experienced, and I work retail! They did nothing to track down my package and all they offered to do was contact the 3rd party to see what happened, and said I would hear back in the next 48 hours. My fiancÃ© is a travel nurse working Covid units and will be leaving in 48 hours, but apparently their hands are tied. Who knows why they didnâ€™t offer to put in a SIF order and have it to me as soon as possible. They did nothing, and should take accountability for their delivery drivers or package handlers openly stealing, sending the conformation that the package was delivered and then defending them. My door was WIDE OPEN all day, I had 3 other packages delivered no problem. This is the worst customer service Iâ€™ve ever experienced, and while I was edgy about depending on Walmart to deliver in the first place, this just confirmed that their customer service is trash and no one in upper management cares about what they do for a living."
1404,43908,Debra Sulzle,17/12/2020,Walmart,Prior to making an order I contacted walmart.com about purchasing a small treadmill and asked about return policy and was told by two different agents that I had 90 days to return the treadmill if I wasnâ€™t happy with it normally itâ€™s 30 days but because of Covid they assured me that I had 90 days. 34 days later I tried to do a return and the system told me I am past the return. So I called and was informed I could not return it. I have also had other items that are not allowed to be returned because of Covid and have had to just throw away that were well within the return period. I will not be ordering anymore from Walmart this is been a horrible experience and not the only one that Iâ€™ve had I rely on their word and I was misinformed not once not twice but three times
1405,43909,Keith,17/12/2020,Walmart,I'm really beginning to hate Walmart especially they online shopping they keep letting these people with these bots grab all the gaming systems and not doing anything about it Walmart socks
1406,43910,Lee,17/12/2020,Walmart,Terrible service. Ordered a blanket on December 4th. Plenty of time for Christmas. It was not sent until I questioned of why it hadnâ€™t shipped. Then they put it into shipping process but it never moved. Checked again and they said I was supposed to get it yesterday the 15th of December but it hadnâ€™t moved at all. Finally questioning again. We will reimburse we tried contacting seller and no response. Chunky gray blanket out in the universe and Iâ€™m getting a refund. Thatâ€™s great. It was a Christmas present and now the 16th. How am I going to get one now joybuy???? If Walmart uses 3rd party selling I see why all the bad reviews
1407,41841,TamMac,17/12/2021,Walmart,"Walmart.com uses OnTrac for its delivery. I placed an order to be delivered the next day and 10 days later still no order. I gave Walmart a deadline of when I had to have my order, which they missed. I then requested a full refund. Walmart only issued my refund after I was able to prove that my order had not even been put on a truck for delivery. FYI .... they use OnTrac. I had also contacted OnTrac. I will NEVER place another order until they change their delivery carrier. OnTrac is absolutely a HORRIBLE delivery company."
1408,41842,Jax Cus,17/12/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a gift for my daughter, it was suppose to be delivered on Dec. 8th. On the 8th they changed the delivery date to delayed. No other information! I have made several attempts to get some answers. Walmart blames the manufacturer, the manufacturer claims my order number doesnâ€™t exist! So my order is in limbo until someone decides to deal with it. Customer service is getting worse by the minute!!! So I will be taking my business to their competitors for now on. Iâ€™m tired of this back and forth game where nobody knows anything. I hope you think twice before ordering from Walmart they just donâ€™t care about the customer or customer service. If I could give you a negative star rating I would. But thatâ€™s not allowed. Guess that need to see at least one star to make them happy"
1409,47349,Ervin Hansen,18/12/2013,Walmart,"I have ordered some times from Walmart, using Paypal, and it has gone well. Now, for some reason, purchasing a giftcard, worth 20$, my account is being flagged. And nobody can tell me why, and all I get is the same standard replies when I write Customer Care. That has been going on for 3 weeks now. Paypal has accepted, and I use Paypal frequently, so it is with Walmart. Walmart wants in on th e-commerce - they need to shape up with Customer Care, and have qualified people handling customer issues.  Very dissatisfied with the Walmart Customer Care!!"
1410,46911,msmariam,18/12/2018,Walmart,It is a bad experience to buy from Walmart online. They ship you stuff from another vendor and you have to stuck with returning shipment fee. It is not easy process. I really prefer Amazon.com
1411,46912,JoseAngel Galindo,18/12/2018,Walmart,"I bought some items on Nov 20th for Black Friday, and it stated that they have the items at the stores, when I pick the one close to home and did the checkout they give only the option to a store that was 10 miles away from home. When I arrived to pick up the items they said they where out of stock, that they will ship the items to that store that I have to wait until I received an e-mail to pick-up. The last item arrived on Dec 6th (more than 15 days after) but due to the distance to the store I was not able to pick-up the items right away, so ""their policy"" states that I only have 7 continuous days to pick-up otherwise they will start a return, and they did. Know I have to wait 5 business days for the return. They only answer they have is that's ""our policy"". So for them to ship the items took +15 days and for the return they have 5 Business days, but the customer has only 7 days to pick the item, they don't care if you are busy of live far from the store they choose to send you the items. I have talked to two managers (well supervisors since they don't have managers) and the only answer I have had is ""That's Our Policy whether your like it or not"". My advice Go Buy on Amazon!!!!! Walmart is the worst online store so far."
1412,45857,Karen S.,18/12/2019,Walmart,"Buyer BEWARE. In re: purchasing gift card(s) via Wal-Mart.com. I ordered two (2) $20 Steam gift cards. Upon arrival the package contained one (1) gift card only. I promptly called Wal-Mart customer service, to report the problem, and was told that they are NOT responsible for ANY lost, damaged or missing gift cards. They directed me to my financial institution for refund or replacement. I am baffled at why my financial institution would be accountable for Wal-Mart's mistake. Lesson learned: NEVER order a gift card from Wal-Mart again!"

I found the item, purchased the item, spent the premium shipping rate to ensure it would be here in time, today.  With no package insight, I sent an email seeking tracking information only to get the reply ""the item is on back order, we will refund your money'.  BEYOND REPREHENSIBLE!"

My credit card account has been charged though! I'm really upset! I needed this item quickly, and I even had an email saying it shipped and was ready to go to USPS! Next time I will definitely use Amazon!!!"

1417,45862,Tom Loos,18/12/2019,Walmart,What a nightmare ordered an item on 11/28 said i would have it by 12/10 then all I get is order delayed. I go to chat they say their is a problem with my order in the system and I should cancel it wait 48 hour and reorder. I ask will I get the same price and will it arrive by 12/25 they can't answer. I ask for a phone number to call. I get some guy on the phone telling me a system problem same advice tells me to cancel wait 48 hour and re order. I ask will I get the same price I get a no. I complain I do then get to get it at the same price. I ask about when will I get it he says 48 hours fine. I point out what a pain this process was and I never had some much work to resolve an issue with Amazon. This is also very true. He starts telling me how much Amazon sucks. Just what I need to hear. I ask for a supervisor. Bottom line the supervisor tells me that my item is back ordered and that my original order would come in before any new order. Well why was I not told that and why was I told to cancel my original order. He has no real answer other than that was the best answer the first person I spoke could give me but he was a supervisor and he could give me the real answer. What??????. Now I did get a promo code from the first guy and I used it to order the item again which the system say I will have it in 48 hours. I did not cancel the first one so I can't wait to see which comes in first. Bottom line they have no process and any answer you get you can't trust. This equals Bad Business.

1422,45868,Robert Maestas,18/12/2019,Walmart,I feel like I need to score Walmart higher because I am just impatient. We got to remember that it is the holidays and they are swamped. The online support has tried to help me the best that they can so I am going to raise the score from 1 to 3 stars.  They take forever to ship. I don't know how they are going to compete with Amazon. My package has been in processing for a day. It took 10 days to ship and I need my package for work and now it is just sitting in processing... It said it would be ready by 6 PM and now it is 7:25 PM and they said that they stop pick ups at 8 PM. I know its the holidays but dang it has already been 10 days. I could have got the PC from Amazon in two days. I will never buy from Walmart again. Deal or no deal.
1423,45869,Djuki Muliawan,18/12/2019,Walmart,"I ordered two iPhones during Black Friday weekend (12/1/19). Walmart uses OnTrac for delivery, and I have the worst on-line shopping experience in my life. One of the phones was delivered 11 days later on 12/12/19. The second one has not been delivered yet as of 12/18/19. OnTrac website keeps changing the ""promised"" delivery date to the next day, and the next day, and the next....  I have contacted both Walmart and OnTrac several times but they cannot provide any real help other than ""investigation"" and ""escalation"". I even had a 3-way call with representatives from both companies.  Walmart should own this problem and never use such an unreliable partner. If Walmart wants to compete with Amazon, they need to find a more reliable courier.  Around the same time that I ordered the phones, I also made online purchases from Amazon, Shutterfly, Bank of America, and Homeboy Industries (homeboyfoods.com). All orders arrived on time.  In case you don't know, Homeboy Industries ""provides hope, training and support to formerly gang-involved and recently incarcerated men and women, allowing them to redirect their lives and become contributing members of the community."" Yes, they did an excellent job. Yet, Walmart, founded/owned by the richest family in the US, cannot. Shame on you, Walmart! You should be ashamed of yourself."
1424,45870,Vickie Campbell,18/12/2019,Walmart,"I ordered an item from Walmart.com and I used Affirm to pay for it. I was able to pick it up in a timely manner, no problem so far. A few days later I noticed the same exact item had dropped in price by about 50 dollars at Walmart.com so I went to the store to see if I could get a price adjustment. No, I was informed that I would need to return the item and purchase it again. So I thought Ok I will return it, get a full refund and order it online again. This is where it went bonkers. If I had known that it would have been this much of a hassle I would have kept the item instead. The Walmart store only refunded the purchase price and not the sales tax. I am told I need to request the refund of the sales tax from Affirm because it was Affirm who charged the sales tax. I was confused cause that does not sound right. I purchased the item from Walmart.com and returned it to a local store and I don't get my sales tax refunded. I never opened the product. So I call Affirm and have them dispute the charge since that is the only way to not be charged the sales tax for an item I returned. Lesson learned do NOT order from Walmart.com and use Affirm to pay for your items. The customer service person also mentioned someone had purchased an expensive TV and had to get their sales tax refunded by Affirm too. So lesson learned if you purchase something from Walmart.com and use Affirm, do NOT return it cause you will not get your sales tax back and will have to dispute the charge through Affirm.  Note: I had thought to reorder the item online shortly after returning the item so I could get the lower price and prior to my noticing the refund was wrong and suddenly Affirm is unavailable."
1425,45872,Concerned consumer,18/12/2019,Walmart,"Walmart's online service and store pick-up need to be updated more efficiently in matters when they do not fulfill an item you purchased that was in stock but then they send you a notice on your pick-up date that it was out of stock and they have to have it shipped from another state, regardless of the fact that the item is available at other store locations. I contacted Walmart online chat to see if I could pick-up from another available location that had my item available, but I was only offered a refund. I did not want a refund because I felt it unfair to wait an additional 3-4 days for the amount of my purchase to be placed back on my card, before repurchasing item. The item I was waiting for was shipped from NC to Va and was due to arrive three days after the original pick-up date. I then decided after no updates online that the item would probably be delayed again so I once again contacted through email and online to see if an in store credit could be offered so that I could find a store in my area that had my item in stock, but was once again turned down and only offered a refund. I do not understand why Walmart operates this way, or why they would have a system that is this inconvenient to customer. Walmart made the mistake and offered me an item that was suppose to be in stock on the day it was offered to be picked up, and because they did not honor this I can not see any reason why they could not have offered me in store credit on my purchase. This issue needs to be escalated. No one can give me an answer. Updated: As it turns out my purchase never arrived from the Fed Ex truck, matter of fact when I called back to complain to Walmart's main number It was only then that I was told that my purchase would have to be refunded because the item they ordered ""which was not from a third party but Walmart Exclusive, the item they ordered from NC location had been ""damaged"" in shipping! After all the ranting I'd done, no one had the decency to email with this update letting me know that my item had been damaged, and if not for calling Walmart directly I would have been waiting another 3 to 4 days or whenever they had decided to clear the amount they took out of my bank! They did give me a gift card to cover the amount plus a little extra for my trouble which I appreciate, but the item I purchased will now be difficult to find because it was a Walmart Exclusive limited time item, which is why I tried ordering for pick-up to begin with!"
1426,43894,customer,18/12/2020,Walmart,I ordered a video game online for Christmas. I selected â€œship to homeâ€ and then I get an email today my order was cancelled because I DID NOT PICK IT UP!!? I called to question it and they told me thereâ€™s nothing they can do I can reorder it once I get my money back. I just placed my order from TARGET. WALMART IS USELESS. DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM HERE IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT THE PRODUCT.
1427,43895,John Worthington,18/12/2020,Walmart,"I ordered 2 different things on 2 different days. One was an IPAD and the other a WaterPIK. On both orders, Walmart.com showed the status as shipped and they gave the USPS tracking number. After a week, the USPS STILL had not recieved the items!! Walmart eventually showed the items as delayed but upon calling Walmart.com customer service, I found out that Walmart had no idea whatsoever WHERE the items were. This is an AWFUL commerce site that will disappoint you!! Better to buy on Amazon."
1428,43896,Ray Brewer,18/12/2020,Walmart,"same as others. online sale. walmart didnt deliver. walmart cust serv does not talk to their own vendors to procure your order. Their vendor, via email, tells me to track the order via usps--which was a sham. shady vendor sent thru shady shipper where order disappeared walmart said would refund money. walmart then emailed me i need to return the item they would not ship nor talk to their supplier about. i wrote the atty general -will see if i need to return imaginary non delivered items. walmart at no time allowed me to speak to a person. all chats who do not take ownership of their sales. Please for your own sake use Amazon. They know how to work online."

1430,43898,Cortney Chancy,18/12/2020,Walmart,"They took my order, provided shipping tracking, then kept extending my delivery date. They finally said the item was lost by the carrier, which is complete BS. Like they've done in the past, they sold an item they didn't have in stock. What a wonderful thing to do at Christmas time."
1431,41835,Cesca,18/12/2021,Walmart,I ordered gifts for pick up today. One of the items is so badly beat up and missing parts that I have to return it. I donâ€™t understand why the associates donâ€™t pay attention when they are picking items to fulfill orders. The box is beat up so badly that it has been taped also parts are missing. Very inconvenient to have to return this item. I tried calling customer service the phone rang for over six minutes and nobody picked up.
1432,41836,Michelle,18/12/2021,Walmart,"Absolutely no regard for customer. Wasted time ordering curbside pickup items just to get a time only 10 minutes later to get an email stating it's unavailable. Computer still says pickup today. Go figure, let's not be honest and tell customers that they aren't available before payment. This is a very regular thing with this poor excuse for a store. Customer service representative can't do anything but speak policy expecting customers to be OK with the lies. This is why I purchase 99 percent from Amazon."
1433,41837,Donna,18/12/2021,Walmart,I made an order on line it was not what I wanted so we returned it to the store. I was charged a $5.99 Below Order minimum fee of which I thought was shipping. NOPE they do not refund that...I got screwed!!!
1434,41838,GM,18/12/2021,Walmart,"Terrible. I ordered a Nintendo Switch bundle after Thanksgiving. Then I received an email a few days later saying it is delayed. Never got any update since then. I have called their customer service 3 days in a row. Each day they told me they've escalated my case and that someone was going to contact me within 24 hours. Nobody did! I finally got to talk to a ""supervisor"" and was told they don't have it in stock. First of all, why would they offer something if they are not sure it can be fulfilled?! Secondly, I went to their website while I was talking to this supervisor and it clearly shows they have the same bundle but only at a much higher price. He said it was from a third party. Well why can't they buy those items from their third-party so that they can fulfill their own back orders??!! Their customer service is utterly useless and I still don't know what's going to happen to my order. I DO NOT WANT A REFUND! I WANT MY ITEM!!!!"
1435,41839,Sally,18/12/2021,Walmart,"Horrible uncaring customer service (by phone). They barely speak English! Walmart employees closed my account, without my permission. Will call the corporate office at 479-273-4000."
1436,41840,Tracey Tucker,18/12/2021,Walmart,My account was hacked and a guy from Washington ordered a portable gill. They said that there's nothing they can do because the order has been shipped.

Was given free two day shipping and nothing arrived in two days two item was 3 days and two the most expensive arrived 5 Days. How do these places lie and get away with it well back to amazon. At least they try Walmart does not even try ups ground from other side of country this is a 5 day minimum speed should have been two day air. Shame on you walmart they just donâ€™t give a damm.
1440,47136,Michelle Peele,19/12/2017,Walmart,"We ordered a crib through the web site, once we could see that the color was not what we ordered ...through the holes in the box it was in.... we took it back to the closest store to us as per the instructions they gave on the phone. Once we arrived and spoke to the woman at the customer service desk, she informed us that the purchase was a ""third party"" purchase, that Walmart does not honor those returns and we would have to try to return it directly to the manufacturer. Long story short, the manufacturer would not refund our money to us for the reasons that can best be summed up as .. whatever they can make up in order to keep it. We then went through Visa to cancel the purchase however after the 30 day period Visa notified us that they would not allow for the cancellation because Walmart told them we did not follow their return procedures.... which was a lie! Let this be a warning to anyone ordering on line to check the return policy of Walmart or any company selling items through third parties. A very bad Review of the third party manufacturer will be coming."
1441,46908,Erin Bateman Arsenault,19/12/2018,Walmart,I placed 4 separate orders for Trailchaser bumpers for my Jeep. When the first one did not arrive I was told it was stuck in processing. Then was told to cancel the order and order another that was available. So I did that 4 times. Every time they had multiples available when I placed my order. To this day I have not received anything. The customer service although they have tried to help me have not been helpful. I feel like I get different answers from everyone I talk to. I would not order anything from Walmart.com that has to be shipped. I use amazon all the time and have never had a problem with a product getting shipped. I will be going back to amazon in the future.
1442,46909,Joseph,19/12/2018,Walmart,"The goods are nice out there. But the shipping is BS. The wraping is not bad, but I think they can change a Express compnay to cooperate. It's not the first time I shop at walmart. But why I feel like the shopping experiences are getting worse..?"
1443,46910,Anonymous,19/12/2018,Walmart,"I purchased a gift card from a while back, and never spended it. It contained like $20. And when I went to the Walmart store the machine wouldnâ€™t allow me to use it. I asked for help, and they used a key. Still didnâ€™t work, so they told me to come back next time to fix the problem. Ok, I came back, and they did the same method by using the key. Still didnâ€™t work, and they told me to contact the gift card people on phone because they say that my gift card is too old. Thatâ€™s stupid since online says â€œgift cards never expireâ€. And also when I contacted them on phone, they were taking too much personal information like how old I am and whatâ€™s my name and email etc. Of course Iâ€™m not stupid enough to actually give my information! Just wasted $20 guys, bravo, what a great life experience. Also this one time when I ordered on online order for store pickup on December 5th, the website said it would be ready for pickup on the 13th. I looked online and it says it has been shipped on December 12th. On December 14th I went there and it wasnâ€™t ready. I checked online and called walmart, they say I have to have a Walmart account?? So dumb. And now, which is December 18th, it is now ready for pickup. I got so annoyed that I went to buy another product in store and went to cancel my order. Never buying gift cards and putting online orders anymore. Sorry I have bad English."
1444,45855,Reed W,19/12/2019,Walmart,"Awful experience. Iâ€™m usually a patient person and can appreciate when employees are busy, but I genuinely had to ask 4 different people just to find what I was looking for. Finally, the last person I asked was the only one took take me to the item instead of pointing and saying, â€œitâ€™s over thereâ€. I donâ€™t think I can go back to Walmart on Preston Crossing."
1445,45856,Kilyn krough,19/12/2019,Walmart,Walmart is terrible at their delivery service. I ordered my food from Walmart delivery at 11 a.m. this morning. I weighted almost 10 hours where my order. They said it was going to be here. Still not here. I then called Walmart and ask them why my order is not here and where is the guy delivering it like my phone said he was. The very rude customer service lady basically told me that there's nothing they could do it until tomorrow. There was nothing she was going to do for me she returned my delivery fee but now I have no groceries the whole thing was to cook a nice meal for my family so thank you Walmart for all your great help ang your great customer service. If you are thinking about using WalMart delivery service make sure you have nothing important you want to do that day. they are worse than the cable company.
1446,41828,Landon,19/12/2021,Walmart,"Every time I try to order something online, my order is canceled. I've spoken with multiple people that of are no use and just play the blame game on my bank. I tried 3 different credit cards (all from different banks) and shipping/pickup at different locations to no avail. The part that gets me now is they've taken the $750.00 off one of my credit cards after canceling my order. I highly advise staying away from ordering online, It's a joke."
1447,41829,Paula,19/12/2021,Walmart,I purchased a laser jet printer in line. Said you could use your in line receipt to return I store. Wasnâ€™t happy with my purchase. When we took it back. Was told because it was over $150. They couldnâ€™t refund it. As well as it was a third party product. What the heck is this. So now Iâ€™m stuck with this product that I donâ€™t want. I too if bring out $300. So fine with shopping here. Bring back Zellers or done other big store we need somewhere to shop where they appreciate the business and support you. Donâ€™t sell something youâ€™d not going to refund. Sell your own products. So very disappointed.

1454,46907,Paul,20/12/2018,Walmart,"Used the walmart.com web site to pick-up a car battery and they hid a ""core fee' (a California fee to ensure you return the old batter when the fee is refunded) in the Tax line of the purchase. When I was at the store I had the old battery and asked about if there was a core fee, they said no and so I just left the old battery Only next day did I look at the tax a realize it was way too high.  I chatted with the web customer service and the admitted the error in the way the data was displayed, agreed I should have been refunded, but then point blank refused to refund the money, saying I had to go to the store to get the refund. Unlike competitors (like Amazon) there was zero interest is just solving the issue (it's $14, they know the screwed up). We are taking about $14 here that Amazon would have refunded in an instant. WalMart is too focused on ""which bit of WalMart screwed up"" and not enough on ""let's make the customer happy"". Not a patch on Amazon and if the prime fee is what it takes to get the best customer service, it's worth every penny. Really really poor experience. I have to contrast it to Amazon, where their approach feel much more like they give their staff the authority to 'make it right' - I am sure there are limits. I've never walked away from Amazon web chat feeling anything less than 'that was great, solved in 5 minutes"". WalMart want me to drive 20 miles to the store just to give me what they agree I am due. Nuts."

No store credit option. Refund...5-10 business days. They ordered a replacement. OH and guess what...replacement was going to take over a week to get there. We went to Best Buy, got our tv. Instantly came home and issued a refund. It has been 5 days. No $$$ back. I contact the circus show that runs customer service. The insurance for the TV was processed...but NOT the TV!

Spent hours on the phone with about 7 different people before they finally told me they werenâ€™t shipping it. I could have bought the toy if I had known earlier but they never even bothered to contact me. So now days before Christmas I donâ€™t have what I need and I canâ€™t get it. Awful customer service and completely unorganized. I have never had these issues with Amazon and if they need to cancel an order they NOTIFY you in a timely manner. No excuses terrible experience.

1460,45845,Kay Thomas Slaughter,20/12/2019,Walmart,I placed orders with Walmart and Amazon for ten items each. First two packages were from Amazon. Both orders were placed on 11/25/19. I went on Walmart web site and looked up my orders three of the ten items were shown as â€œCancelledâ€. I attempted to reorder and they sowed either a different higher price or item. Was sold out. Did not experience any problems with Amazon. Walmart used Fed Ex on their package delivery. Two days turned into 6 days. Next was that 2 items were shipped to store. This was the most effective but you have to go to store to pickup.
1461,45846,Thomas Warren,20/12/2019,Walmart,"Walmart.com is a scam. Ordered a product on 12/15. Walmart says they shipped it on 12/17, arriving 12/19. Today is 12/20 and it has yet to be given to FedEx. They created a shipping label but never gave it to the carrier. I will not be getting it in time for Christmas. Walmart is HORRIBLE for promising that you'll get something by Christmas knowing full well that you won't. They do this just to get the order. Because they know if they told you it would arrive after Christmas you'd buy it from somewhere else. Never again Walmart. This is the 2nd time this happened. It's not a fluke....it's how they do business. Buyer beware."
1462,45847,John Rose,20/12/2019,Walmart,The only thing to say about Walmart/Lansdowne/Arbutus Maryland is pathetic but this is what you get when no one cares.I don't understand why the corporate office doesn't shut this place down and start over again or maybe because they don't care either
1463,45848,Long ThÃ nh Nguyá»…n,20/12/2019,Walmart,"A 0 if I can, cancel my Black Friday order just because â€œout of stockâ€. Donâ€™t sell what you canâ€™t."
1464,45849,Candace,20/12/2019,Walmart,"I would give 0 if I could. I bought an item and ended up finding it cheaper at another store. Returned the item the same day of purchase, with receipt, and apparently there was an error putting it back onto my bank card. They told me that my only option was a Walmart gift card. Ridiculous!!! They were extremely rude and not willing to try it again or figure out a solution. I wanted my money back, not credit to this ridiculous store. Very upset with how poorly they handled the situation."
1465,45850,George Board,20/12/2019,Walmart,"My order was lost and i was not contacted until 10 minutes before pickup time. It then took 2 days to find out that Walmart lost in inside their own wearhouse 5 days before. They said they could not get it to me for at least 8 days, even if they sent a new one, they would not ship it faster because they were not willing to incur the additional cost. Oh yea, I will also have to wait 5 days to get my money refunded. Customer satisfaction and caring about your customers are a thing of the past with Walmart."
1466,45851,Charity Bryan,20/12/2019,Walmart,"Only because I can't give them 0 or negative. I have tried ordering from Wal-Mart.com on 2 seperate occassions. Both times they have been unable to properly complete the order. This most recent time is over gift cards-I got one for $25, after ordering 2 for a total of $50. When I called to try and resolve the situation they told me I would have to dispute the charges through my financial institute for a refund. Nope, can't send the remainder of my order, nope can't process a return themselves. SO DONE with this crap store. Hello Target!"
1467,45852,Carol Ijames,20/12/2019,Walmart,If i could give no stars i would.. I ordered a Christmas gift for my son... It was suppose to be here on the 18th of December but was not.. My packages hasn't even been sent to Fed Ex.. I called them and tried to find out what was going on and they told me that it was a secondary company i advised them that i ordered from Walmart .com and Walmart.com took it out of my account.. After 2 days of going back and forth with still no product or any one to tell me where and when they offered me a refund that i will not get back by Christmas... And that the Lady hung up on me because she asked me if i needed anything else and i said yes Can you tell me what am i to tell my son and SHE HUNG UP ON ME!! AND I DIDN'T GET A FULL REFUND!!! I PAID $206.06 AND THEY ONLY REFUNDED ME $189.00!!

1469,45854,Doug,20/12/2019,Walmart,DO NOT get propane at Hastings Walmart. Never been treated like that in 64 years( except by a police officer in Lincoln NE 1980â€™s). I was greeted by 2 employees like I was wearing a bomb vest and had a Gatling gun. I went to Menards

1471,41825,Cathie Reposa,20/12/2021,Walmart,"This review in particular is about Walmart+. What a scam! I have been a member of Amazon's Prime for many years and have never had problems like this. First they suck you in with the "" free trial "" then when you try to cancel it you get some dude who doesn't speak English, puts you on hold for 30 minutes, then cuts off the call!!! Then they start charging your credit card $12.95 a month and will not stop! No matter what you do Walmart will rip you off. Their merchandise is low-quality garbage. And I always find mysterious charges on my credit card any time I buy anything online from them. I am through with Walmart, Forever!!!! They have gone so far downhill they will never make it back."
1472,41826,Tamara Draper,20/12/2021,Walmart,"If I could g could give zero stars I would. I will never buy from Walmart again. I was a loyal customer until my debit card info got stolen and about $16,000 in orders for apparently baby formula happened. Whether it was Walmartâ€™s fault or not wasnâ€™t my issue. My issue was that it was figured out that there was fraud within an hour of it happening and 4 phone calls by me and no help laterâ€¦ finally someone helped my husband. Not me, the little lady. But at least someone helped him. They were able to cancel portions but not everything. They at least wanted to help. While no one knew how to stop the orders from shipping, everyone knew that I should contact my bank so they could reimburse the chargesâ€¦ so let me get this straight. Walmart has no set practice to hit a kill switch on fraudulent online orders, but they train their people to know the bank will refund my money? So Walmart gets their $16k in orders, I get it back from my bank and screw the tax payers and let the criminals go free? If I tried stealing $5 from a Walmart store, what do you think would happen? As far as I am concerned, Walmart is 2/3 to blame. Shame on you! Situation was exaggerated once I filed a police report and no one would help the cops catch the bad guys. Finally when I called corporate and told them I was considering filing criminal charges against Walmart did they tell me how police could get informationâ€¦. They did not tell the actual police but me when I threatened to file a criminal suit against them. Hmmmâ€¦.."
1473,41827,Mr Dew,20/12/2021,Walmart,"On November 25, 2021 I purchased a TCL SmartCast TV for $379 on Walmart.com. The ship date was December 8, 2021. That date came, status showed that it was on its way. I waited until 10pm that night, it never came. I expected it to come the next day, so I went on Walmartâ€™s web site to see it was now in â€œdelayâ€ status, so I contacted customer service (which Walmart doesnâ€™t make it easy for you to find) to be told that my TCL 55â€ SmartCast TV was lost in transit according to the guy I was chatting with online. Of course I was furious, so I asked to actually speak to someone over the phone instead of online chatting. He asked for my number and told me someone will contact me in a moment. That moment never cameâ€¦Twice when I went online again!! Did you know you have to google Walmart customer service to find a phone number? Because itâ€™s not on Walmart.com customer service, anyways I called the number and spoke to a gentleman that was somewhat helpful, and hereâ€™s why: He listened to my issues, seem understanding. He did not offer to order another TV, I had to ask. So he did, then told me the price would be $449! I told him, thatâ€™s not correct, and I expect to pay only the sale price that I bought it for on November 25th, because it was lost in transit, and it was I that called to find out! The gentleman finally processed the sale at $379 and said that it will arrive December 23rd. Then a few hours later I get an email from Victoria Covington of â€œWholesale Connectionâ€ which I find out is a 3rd party distributor for Walmart. The email said I have 48 hours to respond to them, because it was a price error/mismatch. She basically told me that theyâ€™re not going to honor the $379 and Iâ€™ll have to pay the regular price, even if Walmart promised me the sale price. I was very upset going through all of this poor customer service, and I will no longer shop Walmart and make certain I use social media as a platform to share this story with as many people as I can, because I use to work as a manager in retail, and realize how important good customer care / service is, clearly as I see on this site, Walmart is failing miserably at basic customer service at all levels."
1474,47321,Jeff,21/12/2014,Walmart,"I bought an iPad for in store pickup. My wife is out and about, so I asked her to pick it up for me (which Target.com and BestBuy.com let you do by editing the website). Walmart.com won't let you make a change unless you call them. The people at Walmart said it wouldn't be a problem when I called them in advance and low & behold, my wife shows up, she's not allowed to pick it up (even though she has all the credentials and I offered to verify over the phone). The store personnel didn't know what to do and there was another woman in line with the same issue. 30 minute hold time on the phone. Crazy that in 2014, they haven't integrated the purchase experience. Walmart is cheaper.... but low class on experience.  What's funny is their people are very friendly, they're just unempowered and not sufficiently trained to do anything for you....which winds up being more frustrating.  UPDATE: No exaggeration here. I finally reached Walmart.com and they were adding my wife's name to the notes. The store employee said they can't read the notes. The Walmart.com representative said ""I'm sorry, this is the procedure that I have to follow."" So, I conferenced called in the Store employee and the Walmart.com employee and they manually verified my wife. The store employee was so backed up with these type of requests that she actually asked if they could continue to use my phone line to verify the others waiting in line! Wow.....just wow."
1475,46904,Kristi Allen,21/12/2018,Walmart,"Looks like I'm just another casualty of this horrible company! I ordered a gift for my grandaughter because it would arrive by Christmas. It was supposed to be here December 18th. ""Arrives by Tue, Dec 18"" thats the the email I received after purchase. Its still in processing! Today is the 21st. I emailed with support and all they said was ""do you want to cancel"" They have one button for help! ""Cancel"". This is just the second time I have tried Walmart to ship something, the last item was 2weeks late. Why did I make this mistake a second time? Trust Walmart? Joke! They don't care!! Simply ooops want to cancel!!!! By the 18th it was to late to get the gift anywhere on time. NEVER EVER AGAIN! I ordered 30 different items at different times from Amazon and ALL have arrived and with zero $$ in shipping cost. Stick to Amazon!"
1476,46905,Kari Lynn,21/12/2018,Walmart,Terrible service. DO NOT order online. I ordered a beanbag chair on December 12th. Was to arrive December 18th. When it did not I called. Was told the item was lost and they could not reorder due to the price has doubled. They refunded my money and told me to go online and reorder it at the increased price. I was lied to from the first phone call. Was told the chair was out of stock. The next rep said that I could pick a replacement. The last rep said absolutely not. They could not help me. And when I asked for a supervisor she put me on hold. Then I got an email saying they processed my refund. Never got to speak to a supervisor. When

Called customer service for the 5th time explained the situation I was out $545.00 NO TV NO MORE MONEY LEFT FOR CHRISTMAS Spoke with a Supervisor got no where with him either!! I asked if I could just go to any other Walmart around the area to pick it up he said no I would have to order it I said I did for the second time and I still donâ€™t have a TV!! By far the worst experience I have had with Walmart!! Not happy at all do not shop online with this company!!! You will regret it!!!
1480,45831,Unhappy Customer,21/12/2019,Walmart,"Ordered an item to be picked up in store on the 3rd. It was supposed to be ready on the 10th. Never got a pickup email, was told by customer service to go to the store because it should be there. Spent 30 minutes for them to tell me they have no idea where it is. Got a refund for it, but I got it on cyber monday, so even if I were to try again I would still be out money! Plus, I have to wait 5 days for the refund to hit my account! Never doing this again!"

I received one item on the 17th and another one on the 19th,the item that was supposed to be here on the 18th finally arrived on the 21st. I do understand that everyone is busy with the holidays and delays can happen but they should not advertise the 2 day delivery service if they canâ€™t do it.Big difference between 2days and 2 weeks.The items where not gifts so I did not had to worry about getting them shipped out in my packages,if that would have been the case I wouldâ€™ve been very upset. I will not order from there website again and I will not fall for their 2 day delivery scam again.Better of to order it and have it sent to the store so you can go and pick it up,that usually works pretty well ,until they put a genius in charge to mess that on up too"
1482,45833,Takeyria,21/12/2019,Walmart,Walmart just made me mad.. How do u sell me something that is out of stock when they told me it would be there yesterday. Then give me a code that I have to spend $45 to get $25 for the inconvenience. It didn't say OUT OF STOCK when I purchased it.. So why do I have to spend money to get money for the inconvenience n they still can't tell me when it will be here. This is crazy but they got my money n my son fontnite game chair for Christmas.. SMH somebody need to do there job better. I'm mad!
1483,45834,Noelle Little,21/12/2019,Walmart,"Never will order with walmart.com again. Ordered a dollhouse for my daughter on 11/28, due to be delivered 12/8. Never showed up. Walmart issued a replacement order on 12/10. Due to arrive 12/18. It is now 12/21 and there is still no dollhouse. Called customer sevice and they have ZERO actionable plans to ensure delivery by Christmas. I paid for a product close to one month ago and have yet to receive it. Oh! And a refund wont hit my bank account for 5 days! So using the money to buy it elsewhere before Christmas isn't even an option! Buyers beware!!! Use amazon!!"

I started the meal ready programs to limit my time in stores, especially Walmart. All I ordered was laundry detergent pods, dryer sheets and scent boosters.  The tracking split the order in 2 shipments and I only received 1 2 days after the original delivery date.  I'm not going to bother calling about it. I'm just here to tell you online is the same as in the store just less customers. Lol  How can a company be this bad geez."

I got a refund without any notice citing that I didnâ€™t like the product, which is a lie! The customer service representatives were misleading and couldnâ€™t help me figure out what went wrong and kept giving me wrong information, until finally 4 days before Christmas I found out that they never shipped the product! Iâ€™m absolutely disgusted and probably will never order from Walmart.com again!"
1486,45837,customer,21/12/2019,Walmart,"The dark side ,of ordering from Walmart ...  The dark side ,of ordering from Walmart ... I have been ordering jars from WM, [they have the best price, if free shipping is considered] I shop with Walmart online, because the store is usually out of them when i go in... I have been having delivery troubles, this last order of jars have been ""missing"" the last 2 weeks....... .... i may finally get my canning jars... Called WM online customer service again,[the 4th time] as my jars were now, out for delivery in New York . [i live in Tennessee] But, not until after I went down to the local Fedex , and talked to the rep there , and they gave me a ""real"" phone number for tracking lost packages, and I talked to a rep-, who said they would have to try to find it, then call me back. a-Fedex rep called me back in just a few minutes, and said,... the package was damaged in NC last week, it was being sent back to WM return center in NY state. --and ,was delivered to them about 10 minutes ago. So, .. when i called WM again... the rep said she would call fedex, then I waited a few minutes, and then she came back, and said she talked to Fedex, --then......tried to tell me my jars were on the way, and I should be patient--,I said no they are not on the way-- then she said they were just delivered, and I should go look outside, and then call them back-- I said,---- you people have been lying to me, - you did not actually call Fedex like you said you did, you just waited a few minutes, and made up a story based on the same tracking info, i can see on my computer.. I told her, I called Fedex, - the package was damaged last week in North Carolina , and was delivered to WM returns in New York today.. not to me-- ......anyway... now,... they have reordered my jars, and gave me a $5 rebate code for my next order.. and now,... my canning jars ""should be"" delivered monday.... I sometimes, .. really resent, trying to deal with ""almost english speaking ,customer service ""foreigners"" [I think WM is in the Philippines - but could be India, Pakistan, or the like ] - understanding them is difficult enough, but so many of them, see no problem at all with lying to you...

I called customer service they told me my order was stuck in processing and I needed to cancel my order and re-order then they would expedite my order. I re-ordered with a delivery date by 12/20. I called back to have the order expedited, the family Christmas was 12/14 and already ruined so the quicker the better, they had NO idea what I was talking about and said there was no such thing as expedited orders for picture mugs. The first person I spoke with gave me the wrong information and sent me on a TWO HOUR rabbit hole search trying to get the gifts ASAP. Well today is 12/20 and NO mugs were delivered. I called and again I was told my order was â€˜stuck in processingâ€™, my options were to cancel my order OR get a refund.... annoying because those are the same thing, not different options. And I still have no special picture mugs for grandparents gifts. I will NEVER order from Walmart.com again!! The customer service is scripted with no real help and makes the whole already disappointing experience more annoying."

They tell me its stuck in processing and i should cancel the order but that they wont honor the price i paid for it to reorder it. I dont think i will be ordering anything else. Update: Said they would adjust price but instead took payment out twice and wont refund the higher amount that I should not be charged and say can only give me a $15 credit on a $25 order so i have to spend MORE money to get what they already owe me anyway!!! NEVER AGAIN...HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Crooked liars!
1490,43883,Princess Jelly-Fish,21/12/2020,Walmart,"I ordered a 7 feet fridge and the delivered a 4.7 feet one, and when I asked for the reason or if there's any way this was a mistake they just said that the only thing they could do for me was to tell me that I should ask for reimbursement but this would take like 8 days to be reviewed and after that God knows how many days until I got my money back IF I met the criteria for the reimbursement to actually take place, this is total nonsense, they didn't give me a reason so what am I left to think it's that this was false advertisement.

1491,43884,Jonathan Snell,21/12/2020,Walmart,"STAY AWAY FROM WALMART ONLINE ORDERS!! I ordered an Instant Pot cooker on November 19th during the Black Friday sale. I was super excited to get this for my mom for Christmas as she had wanted one for a couple of years, and this one was 50% off during the sale! Since they were sold out at my local store I decided to place the order online, with shipping showing it would be ready for pick up at my local store for December 13th. This already seemed like a pretty unreasonable amount of shipping time (especially for a company as well established as Walmart) as I order things online all of the time and have ordered things directly from China that have been here in under 2 weeks. but considering the pandemic circumstances, the time of year, and that it was still supposed to arrive well before Christmas, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and placed the order. Dec 13th, no correspondence showing that my package had been delivered to the store and was ready for pick up, so I checked the tracking and this was (and still is) the latest update: ""Mon, Nov 30 On the move | 10:48 am Calgary, AB Shipment left distribution center and is in-transit to pickup store"" I thought it strange that the latest update was in Clgary, and from nearly 2 weeks prior, as Calgary is only a day drive from where I am, but decided to give it a few days just incase there was a hold up on their end for a couple days, which does happen from time to time and is not unreasonable. Dec 17th, still no update from my local store informing me to pick up, and tracking still showed in transit to pick up store from Calgary. At this point, with a week until Christmas, I felt I should reach out to customer service and see if they could help me out at all. After 40 minutes on hold I was able to speak with a live agent who told me that they would look into this matter and get back to me in 2-3 days... huh? that is unusual, but okay all I want is for this package to be here by Christmas, so I play the game. Dec 21st, Still nothing. No call. No email. No update tracking. No sign of my package at my local store. Now I'm getting a little frustraighted. I call into customer service, and again have the pleasure of waiting on hold for 45 mins to speak with a live agent. This agent takes my order number and just reiterates what the tracking is telling me and I tell him that there is no way it should take 3 weeks (Nov 30th - Dec 21st) for a package to come from Clagary to my local store. He says all he can do is refund my order, so I ask to speak to a supervisor. After 1.5hrs on hold(!!!) I get to speak with a manager who (in very broken English) informs me that it is an issue on their end and that they may have lost the package, and that all he can do is offer me a refund, but this will take 7 - 10 business days, and when I receive the refund I can go buy the product from my local store.. I explain to him that I purchased this product for 50% off ($70 vs. $140) and that I have waited over a month, and through no fault of my own I have never received the product. And even if he were to issue a refund, I would still have to pay full retail price ($140), when I had already purchased it from them for half that price! I asked if, at very least they could honor that sale price so I could pick this up for my Mom before Christmas to which we offered me a TEN DOLLAR STORE CREDIT! This is the only resolution that was offered to me and the over all tone of the conversation was very ""You are SOL, sir"". There is no other customer support team or contact number for anyone, so I have no option but to cancel this order and except this refund wich will not be enough to purchase this product at full retail price. I am now scrambling to find another present for my Mom before Christmas. SHAME ON YOU WALMART! Thank you for making a horrible year even worse. Merry Christmas."
1492,43885,Melanie Mays,21/12/2020,Walmart,Shopping online with Wal-Mart has been the worse experience I have had not once but twice. The customer service reps have no solutions to the problems of there shipping. I'll never shop online with Wal-Mart ever again!!!
1493,43886,John D.,21/12/2020,Walmart,"We ordered a webcam from Walmart.com at the beginning of December. It was available from many reputable vendors, but Walmartâ€™s price was slightly lower, so we decided to try them. Item never arrived on the day it was promised.  I called Walmart and got some outsourced customer service rep who stated that there had been no â€œmovementâ€ for the last 5 days and that the item was lost. Therefore, we should cancel the order. I asked if a replacement would be sent. He said they do not send replacements, but that I could order the same item for $30 more (about $109).  I told him this was unacceptable and asked to speak to a supervisor. He said none were available and that he put a request in to have one possibly call me back within 24 hours. I told him I would like to resolve the matter today in case I needed to place the order with another company.  He recommended that I cancel the current order and place a new order at the higher price. He then suggested I call in after the order had gone through and request a price adjustment to the original price I paid. I replied that I was skeptical that I would receive said adjustment, after canceling the first order and paying the higher price. I also expressed that it seemed unethical to process my original order at a lower price and then try to charge me more for the SAME EXACT ITEM I never received.  I asked if they could expedite the order, since it hadnâ€™t arrived on the promised date. They said no, not unless I wanted to pay for it.  I asked what recourse I would have if the item once again did not arrive. He replied, just keep calling and canceling your order for refunds. This was not satisfactory customer service.  Had I known Walmart would try to bait and switch us, I would have ordered from another vendor a week ago and I would already be in possession of said item. Instead, I am left with no item, terrible customer service from Walmart, and will be placing the order with another, more reputable company that stands by their prices and service. I asked to speak to a Walmart customer service supervisor and was told that one would â€œcall me back within 24 hoursâ€. I never heard from them. Shocking. Shame on me for believing in a company with such a bad reputation. I will not be using Walmart.com again."

In trying to track the delivery I noticed that a label was created but no request for delivery service to pick up. I called BAP over 27 times - no answer, no response to my messages. 12/09 Walmart gave BAP 48 hrs to call me. They never did."
1495,43888,Tammy,21/12/2020,Walmart,Nov 18th I ordered a toddlers kitchen for my grandchild. His birthday was the 14th. Its now Dec 21 and it appears it wont even make it for Christmas. Ill just continue ordering from Amazon a lot less stress!!
1496,43889,Ken Kiepert,21/12/2020,Walmart,"I only gave one star because there is not an option to give less. Shopping@walmart on line has been my worst shopping experience ever. If you are short on stress and aggravation and you feel like being lied to and treated like garbage, then this is the place for you to shop. They have the best misinformation team i have ever seen. If you are ever in the mood to disappoint your loved ones, send them a gift from Walmart.com. it won't get there on time and they don't care. If you call to find out where your item is and why it wasn't delivered, they will lie to you until you get off the phone. #walmart.com the home of disappointment!!!"
1497,43890,Karen Antler,21/12/2020,Walmart,Pick up is awful. They donâ€™t have half the stuff the web site said they did. Scheduled a pick up time 2 days later then my order date and it still wasnâ€™t ready for my scheduled pick up time. Will never do this again I hate Walmart. The store in Ct are disgusting They donâ€™t have any inventory to sell recently went to West Haven and Milford stores looking for a curtain. What disappointment. Iâ€™m done
1498,43891,Vicki,21/12/2020,Walmart,"Walmart.com is a joke! I placed an order in November and it didnt arrive by the time they started. The order was canceled and refunded. End of story or so I thought. Fast forward 1 month. I get an email saying they were charging my account again because I never returned the item! What am I supposed to return a box of air?After dealing with multiple people across the globe literally, all I get are people wanting to rehash the entire story, when the bottom line is why did you take my money again AND when are you giving it back! Their promises are a joke! 1st and last time I ever order anything from them again! All I got was a headache and a waste of about 5 hours now and still nothing is resolved! I'm told to call back and ask for billing, when I'm told on the phone that I am talking to the billing Dept! For all I know I was talking to the janitor! Your service didnt even deserve the one star I HAD TO GIVE to be able to post!"
1499,43892,Lynda Rendell,21/12/2020,Walmart,I'm senior waited 45 minutes on phone to order no one came but yesterday after half hour guy does and gives me a Quebec number yo call.
1500,36262,Leah S.,21/12/2018,Amazon Go,"What is not to love? Great tasting, resonably priced food, and super fast!  Going here takes a little bit of prep work - downloading the app, but after that you are set. Walk in, browse for your food and walk out! You might giggle as you walk out because you feel like you just stole something but no worries, you will get an alert that tells you how much time you spent in the store, and what they charged you for!  SO SIMPLE! ALSO - the average time i spend in the store is 1 minute, 31 seconds! Umm come on, you can't beat it!"
1501,36261,Emily B.,21/12/2019,Amazon Go,This is a glorified convenience store that requires a special app on your smartphone. I do not reccomend this store for the average person.
1502,41819,Aaron McGinnis,21/12/2021,Walmart,"Ordered 5 items only 1 was correct, terrible experience. First and last time shopping online at Walmart."
1503,41820,Denise Rabon,21/12/2021,Walmart,"If I give Walmart on-line ordering zero stars I would. I order Ride on toy (3) of them, Walmart sent the wrong ones and when I called they said it would be after Christmas to get replacements. We decided to keep the ones they sent and now it has taken me two weeks to cancel the replacement order. They still have not cancelled it. 8 calls later still dealing with people I can't even understand (do not speak English good). One of the toys was missing a charger so I had to order another one. Please use Amazon, they are so much better to deal with."
1504,41821,Kannan,21/12/2021,Walmart,"Hi,  Recently, I have booked a Samsung 75 Inch Neo Qled TV at Walmart.com during the thanks giving at the price of 2000$. Walmart has delivered a incorrect TV(85 Inch TV). I asked for the customer care and they sated to return the TV and they can refund, I asked for the replacement TV which I ordered, but the walmart person stated they can't do as the price of the product was increased to 2700$.  Then after hours of conversation in phone, the Walmart team stated to book a new TV and they have provided the 700$ discount. They told they raised a request for return of the 85 inch TV, but none came to take the TV back. Then from walmart.com I raised a return request of the incorrect TV(85 Inch) and they picked the TV. On the same day walamart email alert stated that the return was cancelled. The return shippment tracking number states that item is picked up but there is no other tracking details after that. Tried to call the walmart customer care by phone and email, but no response.  My Incorrect TV is gone and money(2000$) was also not yet refunded. Very worst experience."
1505,41822,Yolanda Herring,21/12/2021,Walmart,"I Yolanda worked for walmart almost a year before I took ðŸ˜« on August 14, 2021.I had a small stroke. And they never called me to see how I was doing, or if I needed anything. The 4 Months I was down trying to gt back on my feet ðŸ˜« ðŸ˜©, and when I decided to go back to work. They terminated me from the job, with no explanation for my termination. Never said sorry ðŸ˜ž for what happened to me, ask me if I was ðŸ‘ ok .or how I was feeling, or doing better. I wouldn't recommend this employment to anyone, because all walmart care about is making money and if you gt sick or hurt they will not waist time replacing you, just how they did me I worked for store numbers 6395 in Bluffton sc I will never shop hear again after what they did to me."
1506,41823,Eliza Tsang,21/12/2021,Walmart,"I used to order weekly delivery from Walmart, this time was delivered by Doordash. The delivery guy has not been given my unit number and created a big scene to my concierge. When he arrived my door I asked him to put groceries on the floor and I handled after. He tried to show me his phone how wrong and stupid I was not putting my unit number on my order. I said I order every time, how everytime there was not a problem. He started dumping my groceries on the floor he was very upset. I asked him to stop, he said if there is any damage I just returned them........ And he started to threaten me saying something like hurting me or what, as he speaks with an accent I barely heard and was not intentionally make it a big threat to myself.......... But yes I'm very scared. All I ask is someone with a passion in his job and I pay for the service. Am I asking for too much? I still don't know if I should report to the police for threat yet??"
1507,46903,Jeff Rasmussen,22/12/2018,Walmart,Ordered Dec 4th and one item came in (toiletry item) but the food items never arrived - poor communication too. But was able to get a refund processed real easy - so I am less p-ohed But not buying again - will go to the supermarket ! Or Amazon.
1508,45824,Lola Miller,22/12/2019,Walmart,My Christmas present for my daughter got shipped to New York somehow. I got the 3 other things I ordered just not the one my daughter wanted most. Canâ€™t reorder cause itâ€™s out of stock and all I got was a refund my daughter wonâ€™t understand. Thanks for messing up Christmas
1509,45825,kimara comeaux,22/12/2019,Walmart,"They promised to have my order ready since 12/18/19 & today is 12/22/19 and the order is still not ready. I wish I could write a review with no stars. I will never do business on Walmart.com again. Do they not realize how embarrassing it is to show up without your xmas gifts and explain to the people it's not your fault. So frustrated, but they was fast to take my money from my account."
1510,45826,Coey,22/12/2019,Walmart,"I don't know how these people sleep at night! I ordered 2 tvs for my kids for x mas. They were suppose to come on Tuesday. Then i received a message on my phone saying they would be here Monday. Monday comes and goes no tv. Then we called the next day, they said they would arrive that day . Still nothing. We called back they said between Wednesday and Friday FOR SURE. Nothing. Called yesterday and explained that we are having x mas today and need the money back to go to the store and find something . They said it would be 5 to 10 business days before that money returns on the card . So tonight my kids will not have their tvs. I wish I had read the reviews first. The manager sent a 25 dollar gift cert to my email which will never matter because I will never use them again. Normally I wouldn't even worry dealing with Walmart. Normally they would make things right but they could really not care less. They have truly done nothing at all to help other then lie about my stuff coming. Years ago this would be unacceptable but now things have definitely changed. Please don't take me wrong. The purpose of this review is not to run down walmart. The purpose is to hopefully keep someone else from making my mistake and if it saves one person from repeating this its well worth it!"
1511,45827,Jeff Durica,22/12/2019,Walmart,Great store.. will continue shopping here.
1512,45828,Kendra bragg,22/12/2019,Walmart,I Will Never In My Life Deal With Walmart Online Ever Again!My Son Birthday Was Dec 5 & I ordered him some items Nov 28 & Here it is Dec 21 & I still haven't gotten what I ordered.I Ask for a refund they say it takes up to 5 business days to go back into my account but it took them seconds to take my money off my card.So why does it takes this long to give me a dam refund.I'm so over this bsâ€¼Highly upset & customer service is no better but like I said Never In Life Again.
1513,43874,Lizbet Basulto,22/12/2020,Walmart,Horrible experience never buying from Walmart again!!
1514,43875,Mom Baer,22/12/2020,Walmart,This is by far the worst experience I have had to deal with any company. I ordered photo ornaments online as Christmas gifts. I placed the order December 7 and 10. I was told they would be here by Christmas. I figured there wouldnâ€™t be a problem with them arriving by Christmas since I ordered them pretty early. To my surprise they are all delayed and not expected to arrive until after Christmas. I work for Amazon. I expect my orders when they are promised. Walmart is a joke on their promise for delivery.
1515,43876,erika skarlet,22/12/2020,Walmart,I went to the Walmart store Saturday to buy a formula for my baby and the cashier act racist and told me I can't buy the formula because is no the right formula and I told her what are you talking about ?I buy the same formula every single day and NEVER has this problem before and the cashier was so disrespectful with me if I need to go and talk to someone about the lady who do that to me I recognize her if see her because I don't think its right this people treat the customers like that I think the cashier treat me like that because I am Hispanic this is call racism that's why you guys are losing the customer because the employees that you guys hired .
1516,43878,Gabriela Castellanos,22/12/2020,Walmart,So the Walmart.com didnâ€™t send me items on time. When they finally arrive so late I have to make a return so unpleasant. I hate shopping at Walmart. Then the customer service help was at Canton Walmart and the representative was Cesar. He was very helpful to the fullest! Is people like him that keep me coming to Walmart aside for items that I canâ€™t find anywhere else. He thrived in helping me out and during Christmas busy time. Thank you for your help Cesar
1517,43879,Matthew Fillion,22/12/2020,Walmart,"Good day, I ordered a bike for our grandson on December 5th. Ten days after placing the order I called customer service to see why it hadn't shipped. I was informed that it was scheduled to ship on the 22nd and would arrive by the 24th of December. Today is the 22nd of December and I called customer service to see why it still hadn't shipped. I was now informed that it was out of stock. Is Walmart that incompetent that they don't know if they can fulfill an order for 17 days? Now we have 1 day to find a replacement. Thank you, Walmart (sarcasm)."
1518,43880,Robert Fox,22/12/2020,Walmart,"There is no accountability for the sellers. Items no show, are junk or no updates what so ever. No buyer protection offered, no way to communicate. When ordered items show date that you will receive it, then after purchase item email disappears, with no updates or expected ship date. Don't use this sight for gift items."
1519,43881,Hanan Mike,22/12/2020,Walmart,"on a 36-minute call, Javier, from the call center customer service stayed with me helping me find something, the guy was so decent, patient, knowledgeable & cooperative, not only that, but by his assistance, he saved me lot of time by searching for me the very particular store I can go pick my needs directly instead of driving & searching in many stores with no benefit, that was so valuable to me because in such a time (Christmas Holidays) the one's time is usually so very tight and I wouldn't make it without this Walmart representative assistance. ."
1520,43882,Misty Muscott,22/12/2020,Walmart,Terrible!!!! Got the exact opposite of my items and the store close 2 me is out so they want mt 2 drive an hour away 4 an exchange...
1521,46902,Tracey j,23/12/2018,Walmart,I ordered Xmas gifts 10days before Xmas 5 of them. Dec 22 I picked up 2 it was supposed to be all ...2 more will come the 27th the rest are in the wind how do they stay in business?? They're pathetic I'll never shop there again what a pita!!!
1522,45818,Amanda Taylor,23/12/2019,Walmart,They mess up orders and there's no way to contact them for a replacement. They give you the run around on their website forever. I was missing multiple items in my order and there was no way to report the issue. Use Amazon. I'll never use Walmart again.
1523,45819,CAROL REYNOLDS,23/12/2019,Walmart,I SPENDS ALOT OF MONEY AT WALMART JUST TO GET SCREWED BY THEM.WORST BUSINESS EVER.LOW PRISES ARE NOT EVERYTHING.GOOD BUSINESS IS.YOU NEED TO LEARN ABOUT GOOD BUSINESS.WAKE UP WALMART BEFORE YOU GO BROKE FROM BEING SUCH A JERK & SCREWING SO MANY PEOPLE.
1524,45820,Thea Board,23/12/2019,Walmart,"I wouldn't give you one star Walmart you suck you you've messed up everything for my Christmas, I will never again shop online, never again Walmart you suck you should be ashamed yourself worst store in America"
1525,45821,Ashanti Franklin,23/12/2019,Walmart,"I ordered an item on their website earlier this month and never received it. They have refused to refund me anything because they say it was purchased on their marketplace from a third party seller. I reached out to the seller who assured me I would receive a refund it's been close to a month and nothing. I have called walmart on numerous occasions and received different explanations that don't add up. They even closed my account and sent an email advising that I violated their policy so they won't be able to issue any refunds to me, all in an effort to keep my money. I have been on the receiving end of a lot of their bad business practices including receiving expired items which I didn't follow up on due to the hassle and time it requires. I am no longer gonna support them and will not stop posting reviews like this until I receive my refund."
1526,45822,Koren De La Sierra,23/12/2019,Walmart,Save yourself the hassle and just order from target. Walmart can't stand by their 2 day delivery and will bs you around. Not helpful and the refunds take forever and a day but they take the money from you automatically. Walmart sucks!
1527,45823,Seantele,23/12/2019,Walmart,"Ordered a camera that was in stock at my local Walmart at 10pm (it would be ready for pickup the next day after 12pm- which it was since again it was an in stock item). Went online at 7am- 9 hours after placing my order to find that the camera was priced $50.00 lower. Called the store and explained the situation and asked about how I could get a price adjustment, since I just placed the order and it wasnâ€™t even ready for pickup. I was told that once itâ€™s ready for pickup, come to the store, pick it up, and go to customer service for the adjustment. I do exactly what I was instructed, to have customer service tell me that they couldnâ€™t give me the adjustment since I ordered online. What? It was an item that was in the store- but whatever. She told me to call 800-Walmart and they would be able to give me the adjustment. I went to my car, called 800-Walmart, got through the prompts to talk to someone to have my call picked up with no one on the other end- just lots of talking in the background. Okay, fine, I hang up and call again and got someone on the other end of the line. I explain my situation and asked for the adjustment. She asked me â€œSo, why do you think Walmart should give you a price adjustment?â€. I explained that before the camera was even ready for pickup, it was $50.00 less. She put me on hold for a few minutes, then came back to tell me that Walmart would not give me the adjustment since I purchased it at the higher price, and I had picked it up. Really??? I then asked if I was able to return it to the store, and then re-purchase it (Iâ€™m still in the parking lot, and the camera is still in the bag). She puts me on hold, comes back and reiterated that Walmart would not give me the price adjustment, but she would send a promo code for $10.00 off of my next purchase of $15.00 or more. I asked again about returning and re-purchasing the camera. She said I could- okay, fine. I go back in the store, back to customer service, and explain what I was told. The customer service representative immediately got a supervisor over to help- then returned the camera, and then tells me that I canâ€™t re-purchase the same one because I ordered it online and it had to go through online returns- whatever that means. She sends me back to electronics to buy the exact type of camera that I just returned. The customer service in electronics was way more customer service oriented, and did the price match for Walmart.com with no problem. Walmart does not seem to care about providing a very customer friendly environment to its customers. I shop Kohlâ€™s.com, Amazon, Target, and Sears.com on a regular basis, and I really believe that this is the absolute worst customer service I have received. Amazon is top notch, Kohlâ€™s and Target is right up there, Sears not quite as good, but reasonable nonetheless. Walmart.com is horrible. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be using them again."
1528,43863,Chris Murray,23/12/2020,Walmart,I ordered online 2 items that were the last in stock I could find anywhere. A day later I saw there were 2 different delivery dates on this order so I sent a question asking about this discrepancy. Instead of any communication my order was canceled. When I asked about why it was canceled and that I needed these items they refused to take any responsibility and even tried to deny me talking to a supervisor or management which was illegal. They still have not tried to correct the issue or even acknowledge they made a mistake.
1529,43864,Customer Kathy,23/12/2020,Walmart,"Walmart.com says that they will price match, but when you contact them they say that if what you're ordering is shipped by a third party it doesn't count. Well most of their items are shipped by a third party. That way they don't have to actually price match anything. It's a scam!!!"
1530,43865,Jaden Offroad,23/12/2020,Walmart,Terrible customer service. Terrible item location. They seem to overcharge me for at least one item almost every time I go in. I think it's their strategy to make more money and I hope I don't notice. So maddening
1531,43866,jfk,23/12/2020,Walmart,"Be very wary of Walmart online ordering. Their delivery estimates are always wrong, expect to add weeks of to delivery  Also you can not cancel orders and get a refund after a very short window of time (30min). They will hold onto your money until the item is delivered then you can return it. They hope you either forget about the order or are to tired to go through the effort to return it.  Ordered a snowblower in December, to be delivered in 2 days, only to have delivery date be moved to January, and they are still holding onto my money.  Amazon, and almost everyone else does order cancellations better."
1532,43867,Carrie Kittles,23/12/2020,Walmart,I swear I am NEVER EVER purchasing from Walmart ever again!!!! I ordered a gift for my daughter and sadly the delivery driver stole it along the way. The woman kept my daughters Christmas gift and all Walmart could do was issue a refund which can take up to 7 days! I talked to 11 ppl and no one cared to even try to help or compensate me for my inconvenience. All they cared about was issuing a refund and the item is totally out of stock in the 12 locations closest to me. It is disgusting how they treat their customers. I was bounced around for 3 hours and nothing was resolved. I will never ever ever on my mama order or buy anything from Walmart again!!!!!!!!! They didnâ€™t even say hereâ€™s a Walmart gift card for your inconvenience or we can have it sent to a store closest to you nothing. I swear never again. To target I go!!!
1533,43868,Gerry Stinson,23/12/2020,Walmart,"Normally, I never had a problem with ordering from Walmart until I encountered a third party delivery service called Estes worldwide forwarding. This was the worst company Iâ€™ve ever had to deal with for delivery. The 70â€ flatscreen set in their warehouse for a week before they setup the delivery, then they sent out a email saying no stairs I told them there is 15 steps to my door, so the delivery was canceled So I called for a refund, the next day I received a unknown caller, I decided to call it back and it was the delivery guy that said he was in front of my house to deliver. But now he is 45 min away and I must reschedule. I told him That I was home did he knock on the door. He said no, smh! If the order was canceled why is he at the door without letting me know that they was going to deliver anyway. Walmart should definitely use a different delivery service. I will not spend money with Walmart.com until they use a dependable delivery service..I have no Christmas gift and the money is in limbo."
1534,43869,Lisa Peppers,23/12/2020,Walmart,I went there to get some Bailey's Irish Cream I was left standing in the liquor aisle 20 minutes no one ever came. I kept pushing the button to no avail as I finally have to leave I hear a page saying help needed in the liquor department I'm sure that would have took another 10 minutes this is ridiculous you shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes to half an hour to get what you need
1535,43870,M WILSON,23/12/2020,Walmart,"They do not help with bad third party online merchants. Also when you write a bad review (per their guidelines) they do not post those reviews! This has really turned me off from buying anything from Walmart. The store itself has problems with bad employees that are rude, unhelpful and lazy!"
1536,43871,Karolin Pujols,23/12/2020,Walmart,"I went to Walmart to get a couple of things, one of those things was a pregnancy test which I couldnâ€™t get. The glass where the pregnancy test does not have a help bottom so there was no way to get someone, we looked around and found a worker we respectfully asked â€œhey maâ€™am can you please help us hereâ€ she was in the other end of the Aisle, she did not even bother to come close to us to see in what we needed help with. Instead, she yelled, â€œwhat you need,â€ I told her I need a pregnancy test she didnâ€™t hear me and yelled again â€œA WHATâ€. She wasnâ€™t much help she just told us to find a manager with a yellow jacket and walked away."
1537,43872,Pat,23/12/2020,Walmart,Zero is right. Ordered a pressure washer as a Christmas gift. Got the email stating it was delivered and it's not here. Turns out Walmart sells for third party and they could care less about it. Told me to contact my bank or credit card company. I would have Never placed the order if I knew I wasn't dealing with Walmart! I will not make that mistake again. I'm done with them.
1538,43873,Olga Korzhavina,23/12/2020,Walmart,"If could give zero stars i'd give three zeros! I ordered online a lot of supplies for the household, EVERYTHING was packed horribly!!! walmart staff just threw everything in the humangous but thin box. EVERYTHING came damaged! not to mention the box was all ripped. I will never order from walmart ever again. Would not recommend to anyone to order from them."
1539,36241,Annette H.,23/12/2018,Amazon Go,"Had to stop by and check out this concept!  Thanks to Yelpers who advised us to download the app first.  On our way out, we saw a bunch of people standing outside on their phones, supposedly trying to download the app first.  :)  So we were able to skip the waiting because we had already downloaded the app.    For some reason I imagined the place to be bigger.  But after taking a loop around the store, I realized it's pretty limited.  Just some snacks, to-go foods, desserts, sodas/drinks, and some knickknacks like mugs.  Prices were pretty high, in our opinion.  But I figured you're paying for the experience or the convenience.  At first, we weren't sure how everything worked.  Like, is it okay if my husband carries stuff, if we're using the app on my phone?  (They said it was okay if he carried stuff too).  Do I have to keep my phone out?  (I don't think we do, because nobody else seemed to).    Fascinating to see all the cameras in the ceiling.  One of these days I'll have to read more about how it all works.  Such a unique experience and I just kept giggling after we left because it was so different.  Felt so strange not going through a checkout counter!  After a few minutes, an email with our receipt arrived in my inbox.  Fun times!"
1540,36225,Alisha B.,23/12/2019,Amazon Go,"It's a convince store with extra cameras and hype. Download the Amazon go app before your head in. Then scan it as you walk in. You can hand your phone to as many people as you want, to add their charges to your account.  You receive the receipt on the app. We changed our minds and put a couple things back, and they charged us correctly. They don't offer many fruits and vegetables. We enjoyed cubed pineapple, though."
1541,47238,OG ModdingTeam,24/12/2016,Walmart,"I ordered a present for a person off the website. I was guaranteed a delivery date. The gift sat in the warehouse for 2 days before they told me they were just shipping it out. He also said he would have the warehouse expedite it. The dude on the phone also told me he would send a gift card to my email for the inconvenience, nothing at all called back and they said he was not in the right to do either thing. Thanks Walmart for ruining my week not being able to give someone who came 350 miles to visit a gift that was supposed to be here the day they left. but was gone 2 days later when the package finally came. You lost a loyal customer, Dont ever order from this site. IT WILL BE A MISTAKE"
1542,47133,Tori Lively,24/12/2017,Walmart,I did all of my Christmas shopping. They didnâ€™t deliver all of my gifts in time but I like their prices.
1543,47134,P,24/12/2017,Walmart,"Scam artists. Found a sink for $430. The product was being sold by Walmart.com via Wayfair. Ordered on Dec 9, 2017, Promised ship date was Dec 19. The sink did not arrive. I inquired to Walmart who contacted Wayfair on my behalf. The reason given to me is that the Walmart site had incorrect information and they apologized for the error. The new estimated ship date was Dec 28. I canceled my contractor and re-scheduled. On Dec 22, I received an email from both Walmart and Wayfair that due to being unable to make the shipment date, they are refunding my purchase price. I went on the Walmart and Wayfair sites and the new price is $504. 2 are in stock at Wayfair. They just didn't want to honor my price that I thought was a binding contract and used some excuse that that couldn't deliver to get out of the obligation of selling it to me at that price. Not my problem. Internet shopping is supposed to offer some sort of confidence. If I am in a real store. If the price tag on the item comes up different on the register, they have to honor what it was tagged with. I have now found the $504 price also on Amazon. They GUARANTEE it will be there on Dec 28th. NEVER AGAIN with Walmart. They should have made things right at the original price!"
1544,46901,Dave Pietricola,24/12/2018,Walmart,"Ordered items promised for Christmas, now scheduled to arrive on the 29th. Was offered a $25 credit for the ""inconvenience."" Is that what our holiday is worth to Walmart? They'll certainly lose much more than $25 from us, as I will absolutely never order from walmart.com ever again."
1545,45813,Angelica munoz,24/12/2019,Walmart,"I went to Walmart auto center to just change my tires before I brought in my car it was totally fine, working perfectly. When they gave me back my car after changing â€œonlyâ€ the tires. it had no power whatsoever, it didnâ€™t go past 20miles per hr. Every time I put it in drive they car would jump. No one could explain why my car was like that, their excuse is that supposedly My car was already like that. If that was the case why didnâ€™t they just stop and brought to my attention what was â€œhappeningâ€ to my car before the service."
1546,45814,James Howieson,24/12/2019,Walmart,I ordered 6 items on the same day and UPS delivered 5 of the items in 3-5 days. 10 days later still waiting for the USPS to come with 1 item from Walmart.... STOP using the worthless USPS.
1547,45815,Lorraine Moore,24/12/2019,Walmart,"Worst experience of my life, ordered my package on the 14th of December, sat in a facility near me for 7 days instead of going to the designated store. 11th day no update as to where my package is had to cancel, then they told me I wouldn't get my refund for 5 days, I'm livid! The whole time I got the run around and told how sorry they were, bunch of scripted bs! They lost a loyal customer, my business will be going to Target's and Kohls from now on and Big lots. They ruined my Christmas completely, not to mention I had back surgery and to put up with all their stress!!!"
1548,45816,doug thomas,24/12/2019,Walmart,"For a MULTI-BILLION dollar company it astounds me that ""Walmart"" used questionable ""third party"" agents to make deliveries. Ordered an item... and found that ""Unique's Shop"" was supposed to make my delivery. My item went to Port St. lucie, Fl... which is a nice place--but I LIVE IN SARASOTA! NEVER GOT MY ITEM!!! You mean Walmart can't get UPS or FEDEX or even the USPS to make their deliveries??? WHAT A FRIGGIN JOKE !!! Can't trust Walmart.com and DEFINITELY can't trust ""Unique's Shop.... STICK WITH AMAZON ðŸ˜¡ DT Sarasota"
1549,45817,Ginger Rogers,24/12/2019,Walmart,"I would never order from walmart.com again..Ordered gifts a few weeks ago, and still the gift isn't here..I call them because it hasn't arrived, even though they tracking info said it was to be delivered today..Low and behold the gift has been damaged and sent back..No one email or phone call to let me know. I asked for a store credit to go pick one up, nope they won't do that. They will refund my money which will not apply to my account for 5-7 business days...It took you 20 seconds to take it out of my bank account, now DAYS...They said we can ship you a new one, but it won't be here until the 28th...What kind of crap is that...Then the female(Anna) that was speaking to me. I said how would you like to explain to your loved ones or children on Christmas morning why they don't have Thier gift..She said and I quote well I never got any Christmas gifts or bought any, So I wouldn't know...Who says that to a upset customer....NEVER EVER AGAIN..I WILL BE TELLING ALL MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO USE AMAZON FROM NOW ON..."

1551,43852,DeeVon Doerksen,24/12/2020,Walmart,"Ordered my husband a Christmas present 2 weeks before Christmas. Ordered online and paid an extra $10 for expedited shipping, according to Walmart website, would arrive no later than Dec. 23. On Dec 23 had ""chat"" with Walmart. Said I had to wait until Dec 24 to make sure it didn't come in. Dec. 24 - still no product. Took 2 days and several people just to have them tell me they used a 3rd party seller and i needed to wait 48 hours or more for seller to contact me and let me know where the product was. I already KNEW it was in North Caroline (I'm in California). Told Walmart to cancel the order and give me a refund. Walmart said it would take 5 business days. In other words they get to keep the product and my money for at least another week and a half - holidays you know. More than angry. No Christmas gift for my husband."
1552,43853,Lisa Golan,24/12/2020,Walmart,Really OMG! Wallmart should not be charging people for their delivery services! I received a gift certificate for wallmart bout a month ago. I'am currently still waiting for 5 products. Misleading info. Date comes n goes no product. Always giving you different dates of Arrival comes n goes no products. I check my emails there are cancelled products I did not cancell. Orders for delivery put in for pick up! Really ! I litteraly want to VOMIT! Wallmart delivery get it together. Once I receive the rest of my products I will NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN!!! ðŸ˜£
1553,43854,Eva Simpson,24/12/2020,Walmart,Iâ€™m am tired of having a cart full of items and having to ring the up and bag myself! This is ridiculous! I am now no longer shopping Walmart or Samâ€™s. I got my Costco membership yesterday! Walmart we donâ€™t work for you! We should get a discount for doing so! Thatâ€™s why Aldi is so cheap!
1554,43855,Holly Tait,24/12/2020,Walmart,"For most of my shopping I shop at Walmart store's, however this year was a horrible experience! Due to the spread of Covid-19 this Christmas I decided to do all my Christmas shopping online. BIG MISTAKE!!! WALMART online shopping was a horrible experience. Items we're out of stock or cancelled. Some items I never received, but got charged on my Visa debit card. I submitted refunds for those items, however after multiple times of calling customer service I still haven't received satisfaction or my refund. I will NEVER use Walmart online shopping ever again!!! ðŸ˜ "
1555,43856,Danny Work,24/12/2020,Walmart,"Went to I-65 service rd supercenter early this morning. Got there and there were no power chairs to shop with. They had one and said it didnâ€™t work. Why was it by the entrance? Tried to by postage stamps at service desk (cashier didnâ€™t have any), they knocked on csmâ€™ s door and was told I would have to wait till they were thru. Can they not hand out a book of stamps? I hate that store. It is very racial oriented!!! Rating should be 00000 stars!"
1556,43857,Mohammad Bedwan,24/12/2020,Walmart,attention Walmart shoppers Walmart will share your credit card information and you will get ripped off like I did I had a charge from walmart.com for $421 and they keep telling me I was charged by mistake and your money will be back on the card in 24 hours and never got it back I have to contact my bank to open up a dispute thay will share your credit card information if you're not paying with PayPal do not shop from Wal-Mart.
1557,43858,Sabina,24/12/2020,Walmart,"It really blows my mind that the largest corporation in the world would has such awful customer service. No one can think for themselves all they can do is read from a script. I received a defected item and they will not replace it. They use shady 3rd parties and do not care if something is wrong, they will not help you AT ALL (that is the shortened version). I'm not even trying to get a refund I'm trying to do an exchange! I literally am trying to buy the same exact item from them. They are not losing a single penny over this! This is not the first time something like this has happened, so I will be boycotting them. Even tiny new businesses have better customer service, business practices, and morals compared to Walmart. Downright unprofessional and incompetent. Shop local and if you can't at least go to Target where the employees are decent people and can think for themselves."
1558,43859,R & M,24/12/2020,Walmart,"Walmart Customer Service for Pick Up & Returns should have the same hours as the Stores, just like every other store. By doing so, Walmart will show that they care for their loyal customers since it will avoid the long lines. Furthermore, Walmart customers will not be misled by all websites showing Walmart stores hours as if customer service hours were the same, causing the customers unnecessary trips to the stores."
1559,43860,Sabrina Simpson,24/12/2020,Walmart,I ordered 2 items online to be picked up at the store...get a message 2 days after it's been processing saying they dont have item in store it will be delayed...fast forward I go to Walmart tell them to cancel it cause I was needing it by christmas n I'd just go back and buy something different off the shelf....and I'll be daggone if they hadn't lied through their teeth...they had the products I ordered but was to lazy to go pull it from the shelf...i got what i needed but still that's a shame that they just declined doing their job it showed pure laziness on their part...if yall are a multi billion dollar company yall need to step it up better with employees and having them get their jobs done..its crazy always messing items up and when you go to correct it they are rude and act like it's your problem and your fault it was messed up so disrespectful.
1560,43861,karen,24/12/2020,Walmart,"I have contacted walmart.com customer service 3 times today with the same problem, and all 3 times my issue was not solved, and all 3 times I got a different answer how to solve the problem from each of the 3 customer service agents. the problem is still not solved. last time I will ever order from walmart.com they are completely inept"
1561,43862,Orlando Martinez,24/12/2020,Walmart,"Warning warning stay away from Walmart online, I ordered a part for my cooktop that was delivered to the wrong address by mistake, the post office confirmed that, I contacted Walmart to get a refund and they never gave me the money back, called Walmart more than 10 times just to be told money is on the way, the never refunded my money, they are a bunch of thieves, stay away from this people, I hope they go out of business soon, I will never shop at Walmart ever again."

The 6 pieces it was in, they fell out of the bad and my heart just sank. How can Walmart continue to promote these kind of ""sub stores"" that sell total junk. Shame Shame on you Walmart. Maybe it's time for you to change your name to Wish or Dollar tree. Just disgraceful."
1566,47237,Cemetra,26/12/2016,Walmart,"I ordered on Dec 9th and the arrival date was to be Dec 22nd and it never showed. How can you lose a 48' goal in transition? After multiple calls and no gift for Christmas, I was offered for my card to be charged again, wait 3-5 days for a refund and replace my order. Let's not forget the $15 gift card that they would send to my email. (Insult to injury) The initial credit was 10%.So you are wanting to take away the 10% and give me less of a credit. Way to go Walmart! Very disappointed. Final resolution was reorder and 30%. Not happy with that but tired of the issue. Order #6152654-796900. Christy the ""manager"" didn't care. She lack empathy and customer service skills. She sounded so uninterested. I understand she may have gotten complaints all day but her lack of care was my reason for the level of escalating. LAST BUT NOT LEAST.. I was told by the final woman that my item arrived on the 22nd as stated. Funny NO ONE else saw it."

1571,45807,Kim Whitely,26/12/2019,Walmart,"The web site is not updated properly and calling customer support is no help. I am looking at an item on walmart.com, it is not available and has not been for months according to the local store. After calling customer service they did confirm the item is out of stock and when it comes back the price is not correct. I drove 30 minutes to get an item the website shows as available"

1573,45809,Janice,26/12/2019,Walmart,"I bought my son a game for his Xbox One from Wal-Mart. This was a Christmas gift so it was not opened right away. My son tries to play the game today and there is no bonus material or booklets inside. Not only that but when he puts the game into his Xbox it says cannot read DVD...... a DVD?! This was supposed to be a new game and the game console is telling me it is a DVD, format not compatible, that cannot be read as in FAKE DISC! The game was loosely wrapped with taped plastic when I bought it but the point is- it was wrapped like a new game. Had it been unwrapped or said used I would have never purchased the game, because I would have known it was returned, and I wanted a new product. I contact Walmart and they tell me there's nothing they can do. No refund or exchange will be given. The customer service representative goes on to say that it sounds like a manufacturer problem and I have to contact the Xbox Corporation. All I want is an exchange or my money back. Evidently this is a big problem for them, and they're tired of refunding or exchanging, so now they're going to stick the customer with paying for something that was stolen. My son was very disappointed and so am I. I will never buy from Wal-Mart again."
1574,45810,Karen Flanagan,26/12/2019,Walmart,"I tried to cancel my order within minutes of ordering realizing it had the wrong address! It still went through! So, I tried changing the address with both fedex and Walmart, no apparently Walmartâ€™s policy is you can not change the address, and fedex states Walmart prevent them from changing the address! I will shop with amazon from now on, gets to me fast and no problem cancelling and changing delivery instructions! Wow Walmart way to go with customer service. I did not even go into the tire fiasco on this review!"
1575,45811,Justin Johansen,26/12/2019,Walmart,"I ordered 2 blu Ray players, same models. Iâ€™ve received 1. I ordered 4 sets of pajamas. Iâ€™ve received 2. There is no way to talk to them about â€œmissing itemsâ€ on their system. Because I paid for 2 blu rays, they only shipped 1, yet I have to RETURN 2 blu rays to get my money back. Same as the pajamas. WAL MART CAN GET REKT!!!!!"

1577,43877,Dawg,26/12/2020,Walmart,"Why do we use Walmart.com website? So, if the item is available, we can head to the store to purchase it or if not available, we can order online. No, it does not work this way. I got online to purchase the Arris Surfboard modem SB8200. Walmart online showed that it was available only online and ""not available for pickup"". This told me that it was useless for me to go to the store since it was not there. Because of this, I ordered it and now must wait 9 days for it to delivered. An hour later, I headed to Walmart to pick up meds at the pharmacy. Since I was there, I drop by electronics. Guess what, there were 4 Arris SB8200 modems. Of course, I bought it. When I got home, I attempted to cancel my online order. I was not able to do it since it was processed. Now tell me this, it still shows that it will be delivered in 9 days, so why was I not able to cancel this order. I did a chat and tried to cancel but they could not. So I asked why did it make me order this online when it should have simple told me that it was available in store for pickup. I kept asking why did your website say, ""not available for pickup"". I could not get an answer. I was told that when the item arrives take it to Walmart for a refund. It now comes to this, whenever you go to walmart online and you see something you want and it says ""not available for pickup"", get on the phone and call Walmart to check, more likely it is there in the store."
1578,36323,Jingchao G.,26/12/2018,Amazon Go,"Very experiential. I downloaded the app before coming in (thanks for my friends tipping) so no hassle getting in. My friend also used my app to get in. Then we took some water and a bag of chips. When we tried to walk out, I was actually looking for a counter but there's none (well silly me, and not read before how this all works). Later in a couple minutes, I received a msg saying we got the receipt. Amazing! They knew exactly what I had taken. Also considering that we changed stuff in the middle, very impressed! I wonder how it works, and will read into that. My guess now is that it has a lot to do with the cameras on roof."
1579,36328,Chantel H.,26/12/2018,Amazon Go,"Amazon Go is such a nice, new experience that I would not skip on your trip to Seattle! Be prepared by downloading and familiarizing yourself with the app before arrival, and then all you do is scan and walk in. Pick up a bag and begin browsing. It was actually as easy as Amazon online shopping to just throw a bunch of stuff in your bag and leave. Bonus: they have nice little 'Amazon Go' mugs and chocolate bars. Perfect for an unconventional souvenir or gift for an Amazon addict."
1580,41818,Phoebe Nigussie,26/12/2021,Walmart,There are too many fraudulent activities and the people that are supposed to help in the chat only try to waste your time and take 5 minutes to answer simple questions. I cannot shop here anymore because it is not safe. I have had my account broken into many times and no one cares to assist with these issues. I give you as much information as you need but they still choose to side with hackers. This is bad reflection on the company.
1581,46895,Bill Carew,27/12/2018,Walmart,I enjoy shopping Walmart.com and the retail stores. Rarely a problem and when there is Walmart takes care of the issue. We shop 3-4 of the retail stores very routinely and employees are generally very helpful and there are always enough checkout lines open so the wait is comparable or better than other stores.
1582,46896,JuJu,27/12/2018,Walmart,Only had one online problem with them returning my gift cards to my account.I did get them back with a nice bonus after a couple weeks.The offline store is a joke.Employees think their crap dont stink and are useless to get help from.I try to avoid them and order online now.
1583,45802,Renee Warner,27/12/2019,Walmart,Standing here in the long customer â€œserviceâ€ line again for a return. Why is there only 1 person for returns when a long line of employees just walked through?
1584,45803,China Doll,27/12/2019,Walmart,"The ONLY reason why this one star exists is because I had to rate in the order leave a review. I would NEVER EVER patronize or purchase ANYTHING else, I don't give a damn if they are the last store on Gods green earth! I ordered mens cologne for a Christmas gift and got womens perfume instead! When the gift was opened, I was so embarrassed and disappointed I could have ridden a horse to slap the snot out of whomever was responsible! Never again..........never again!"
1585,45804,Jessica Candelaria,27/12/2019,Walmart,MY family and I had been standing here at the deli for five minutes and no one has come to help us.

He lied. My Visa was charged for 2. 2 arrived. I was told on 11/30 that Walmart would schedule a freight pickup, and that a credit to my Visa was being ordered. Item picked up 12/2. I then was told a whole bunch of lies about return policy, shipping, etc...On 11/30 I was told it was my problem, and I had to prove the return, and only then would they consider a credit. On 12/27 I tracked the item down as delivered on 12/4. Lies, misinformation, stalling. I still don't have my $225. refund. Buy online from ANYONE ELSE!"
1587,43844,Luna Luna,27/12/2020,Walmart,If I could give it no stars I would. They do not respond to their emails at all. They are rude and It took a really long time for me to get my order from them that I placed online.

1590,43847,Jackie Ponce Griffiths,27/12/2020,Walmart,I had the best experience at Walmart today. This is rare to say. VERY RARE. I also am not the one to leave reviews unless I received horrible service. I was returning a Hot Wheels set and waited in the customer service line. The employee Drew at Walmart in Sacramento (Natomas) off of Truxel Rd he was so excited to be at work. He made my family laugh in line and when we were at his register. It was definitely appreciated especially the day after Xmas. Thank you Drew!  I hope this review gets back to him!
1591,43848,TG,27/12/2020,Walmart,watch your online account with walmart they have been hacked people order under your name and your account if you have a credit card on file they use it and pick up else where with covid 19 they do not ask for ID it happened to me i live in ca but i was the pickup person in florida that morning then when you dispute with credit card company walmart say that you are a partipant in the schem im still fighting i have proof i was home in ca and never was in florida that morning
1592,41817,LAQUESHA WILSON,27/12/2021,Walmart,This company is declining rapidly and it is no longer worth the Hassel. Go to Amazon pay the few extra dollars for the peace of mind.
1593,46894,Brian T. (BJ),28/12/2018,Walmart,"I have been using the online order and pick up in store from many stores and they are good except Walmart. It was a worst experience that I never use it again. 1) I ordered an Lego toy for birthday on Saturday. The order said it should be ready by 8PM on Friday so I thought it would good because I could pick up after 8PM on Friday or early Saturday morning. On Friday, I drove by that Walmart and decided to come in. I found 2 boxes of that Lego toy left but the price was more than online so I did not buy it. Around 7PM, I received email from Walmart saying the order would be delayed 'til Monday. I called the store pick up and they said they ran out of that Lego toy. This meant they never bothered to reserve the item when you submitted the online order. I decided to order Amazon because it was ready to pick up on Saturday morning at Amazon locker. As soon as I ordered from Amazon, another email came after 8PM on Friday saying the order was ready to pick up. I was upset so I decided to cancel the order. 2) Few weeks later, I had two orders. One order with 3 toys and another order with one toy. I received the notification email saying the first order was ready to pick up. I came to the store around 9AM hoping to beat the terrible traffic but I still had to wait patiently in line for 10-15 minutes. There was 3 people behind me. One man came and asked where to pick up online and an associate pointed to the same line so he was the last one. When another associate came to help out, she pulled out the last person in line to help the pick up when she ignored me the first person in line. When I complained to the supervisor who stood nearby, the answer I got was ""She did not know"". What!! What did she mean ""She did not know"". That should be common sense and basic customer service to help first person in line. They definitely needs to provide the basic training to their employees. 3) The second order I mentioned above came and I got the notification while I was at work so I decided to pick up after work. At 4:51PM, while I was still at work, I received an email saying my order was picked. What!!!! I came to the store next day at 9AM, the supervisor said I already picked the order at 11AM yesterday (not sure why I received email at 4:51PM). I told her that I was at work. She told me that she needed to check the camera to find out who picked my order and asked me to come back at 1PM. I came back at 1PM waiting in line for 5 minutes and she said she did not have the time to review the camera. She told me to come back at 8:30AM the next day so I did. When I saw her, she said the video person would not come until 8:45AM so I told her to call me because I spent so much time on this and had to go to work. At 1PM, she called and told me that she found my order. Phew!!I almost got package thief at Walmart pick up."
1594,45796,Monique Samuel,28/12/2019,Walmart,"I watched walmart in lake park Riviera beach, had several semi trucks towed away today. I was really disappointed because those guys work long and hard hours, and the cost to get the truck out of towing facilities are costly. Walmart! Where those trucks were parked was not bothering anybody . In stead of wasting money having hard working people trucks towed, spend that money on teaching your employees proper customer service. .have a heart its Christmas hoilday!"
1595,45797,Mike Dorio,28/12/2019,Walmart,I ordered a bike on line came quickly. The front rim is bent called the customer service and they did not send me a new rim to help nor could I go to the store to get a new rim.
1596,45798,Ryan Little,28/12/2019,Walmart,"Was double charged after I was reimbursed and given no explanation as to why I was reimbursed . I then ordered again, just to have both orders show up on the same day, and noticed they charged me twice for the second transaction. Dealing with customer service was a nightmare. I will never order anything from this place again. If I had payments coming out, I would have had some NSFâ€™s in my bank account. When the item showed up, one of the toy pots was broken. So disappointed."
1597,45799,jackinnaboxx,28/12/2019,Walmart,"I ordered a T.V. on Dec 6th, on the 19th i call customer service and they tell me the order was lost, so i said o.k. reorder. The new delivery date was the 27th, but on the 27th it changed to the 30th. Are you kidding me? 24 days waiting on a t.v.? NEVER, NEVER AGAIN!"
1598,45800,Earl Beachy,28/12/2019,Walmart,"The tire shop in mattoon illinois is pathetic. The staff has no care for customers time, but ever so slowly they slouch around their work area. . They spent nearly two hours rotating and balancing tires on my mini van, and no, they were not busy."
1599,45801,Elita Lewis,28/12/2019,Walmart,"When you order anything from Walmart.com, all you can do is pray that it'll actually make it to your house or the local store. Forget about it coming on time or being given updates or a courtesy email saying it's shipped. Reps can't give you detailed updates about where it is and usually just say it's been lost, order again. It's truly a gamble and the odds are not in your favor."
1600,43834,Rolando Cossio,28/12/2020,Walmart,The worst place in the world to buy the worst deal for the people I've ever seen
1601,43835,Cynthia Vereen,28/12/2020,Walmart,If I could rate a 0 I would. The service is horrible and never order from Walmart.com you will 9 times out of 10 receive your items
1602,43836,David D Irby,28/12/2020,Walmart,"Walmart.com is infamous for saying an item is in stock then telling you it isn't after you place an order. It is also infamous for its very poor shipping practices.  I ordered several items which the site said would arrive before Christmas. It's 12/28, and the items have yet to arrive. One of the items I ordered I had to cancel because it wouldn't be back in stock any time soon, and it was supposed to be a Christmas gift.  Past orders have often arrived damaged or clearly broken.  I will not order online from Walmart again."
1603,43837,Angela Eaton,28/12/2020,Walmart,"I purchased an item online through Walmart from a second hand provider, for my son that was $130. There had been a label made for shipping. And was to be delivered by the 14th of December. On the 14th I got a hold of Walmart who got a hold of the company that provides the item to Walmart. The secondary company responded stating it was damaged before sending and would I like a refund. Since then Walmart has informed me that they themselves (Walmart) cannot give me a refund. That the provider of the item has to give me a refund. Even though I bought the item from Walmart.ca. When I buy an item whether it be at the Walmart store or on walmart.ca I would expect a refund from them not from their provider of items. I understand Walmart gets items from many different companies but it is Walmart who is selling the item to me not a secondary company. Walmart does not provide the refund that I would expect. They're waiting on the other company who for some reason is not responding to Walmart or me. Be wary of purchasing items that are not from Walmart themselves."
1604,43838,Charlie Vo,28/12/2020,Walmart,"I ordered item way back from August till now nothing delivered, I kept calling back,and waiting, wasting time and they didn't give me specific details what gonna be, Terrible system , can't cancel either."
1605,43839,Jenn Wester,28/12/2020,Walmart,"Online order worthless, customer"
1606,43840,Brad DeLong,28/12/2020,Walmart,"The order was""shipped"" on December 10th but there is still no information on the 28th. Calling Walmart.com they say they can send an email. Using the tracking link does it was never delivered to the post office. The best they will do is refund the money, sort of.  They do not guarantee anything. They add on their mark up and want to have you track down your own package from the 3rd party. They had the information that the packages were late and did nothing until I contacted them. Use Amazon instead."
1607,43841,*Well Advised*,28/12/2020,Walmart,"I placed a $119.00 grocery online order and I clicked to try the 15 day FREE trial of delivery for $98.00/year or $12.00+/month... I go to take care of another matter and my card was declined!!!! Walmart took out the $98.00!!! Right then and there!!! Then, I had to wait over 20 minutes to â€œget approval to refund the $98.00! It takes 3-5 business days to get that money back in my account, meanwhile, Walmart wiped out my bank account by just taking my money!!! I canceled my $119.00 order, of course and have to wait 3-5 business days for that, too! Before COVID-19, I ordered and had many items delivered for FREE from Walmart! I canâ€™t always carry groceries, so I have heavier items delivered; FOR YEARS!!! Now, COVID-19, is a get rich quick scheme for many people and companies. Horrible! Still, what is worse, is, it is not empathetically clear, that if you want to try the unlimited delivery for Free; Walmart is going to charge you for a years membership, immediately!!!!! Amazon doesnâ€™t do this, nor does other grocery/merchandise stores. No one has to be victimized by Walmartâ€™s sneaky scheme to rip off customers. It was convenient to order from Walmart, it was 10 minutes by car from me... now, I will go anywhere and everywhere else, except Walmart. I had to cancel a Veterinarian appointment because Walmart wiped out my bank account w/o having CLEAR CONSENT to remove $98.00 immediately from my account! Buyers Beware!!!!"
1608,43842,Becky Ben,28/12/2020,Walmart,"If I could give negative stars I would. I will never order online again. They shipped my daughters Christmas present not in a box put the packing label right on it and it was left in the snow on our porch. Customer service was no help at all and offered me a $25 giftcard as compensation even though that doesn't even cover the cost of the toy. They told me I could also go online and reorder it when it's back in stock which who knows when that would be then call back and they could credit my card. Who wants to jump through all those hoops when this wasnt even my fault in the 1st place!!!!! Terrible customer service. When I told them that doesnt work because I would have to rebuy and be out more money she said I could call the billing department tomorrow and see what they can do. Again, now I'm the one sitting on the phone and doing all this when your company delivered me a toy that is now soggy and damaged!!!!!!!"
1609,41812,Lesa Johnson,28/12/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a iPhone xr over a week ago, still haven't got it, I talk to walmart.com it was support to come through fedex but fedex never received my package now they saying I got to wait another 48 hours before I can make a claim and they can do something about it, I have never had this much trouble with an order in my life and I don't think I will ever order anything online again from them at this point."
1610,41813,Tom,28/12/2021,Walmart,"Went to the Davenport Iowa store to shop. Went to checkout and there was 1 full service checker available. We waited in line for 20 minutes to get checked out. A gal that was restocking the gum was very rude when we made a comment about this. She said help was hard to get. True, but maybe she could have stopped restocking him and ran a cash register. Also there were numerous employees doing the personal shopping. Iâ€™ve been against Walmart for awhile with their crappy service, but you finally convinced my wife. Kiss us goodbye Walmart. We wonâ€™t becoming back."

1612,41815,Jami M,28/12/2021,Walmart,I was paying $12.99 for Walmart + and I found something I wanted to get my grandson with a huge discount online. When I got to the store and found the item and was checking out it came up full price. I summoned the manager and told her about it and she declined to give me the discounted price. I was very upset and didn't get the item. So online and when I scanned it at the store with my app it was discounted but the manager refused to honor that price. Seems to happen alot with the new updated walmart app which I don't like.
1613,41816,Damien Hartley,28/12/2021,Walmart,Walmart is amazing! I prefer and recommend Walmart over any other store. It's not that I have never had issues but Walmart makes up for it via there generous prices and friendly customer service.
1614,46893,Lisa,29/12/2018,Walmart,"I will start calling you Sears,,, Toys r us .. Kodak ,,, Smith Carona Youâ€™re going down Horrible service. Do not order from them They donâ€™t care They canâ€™t get it right Their vendors donâ€™t care  You will never be Amazon ,, EVER Iâ€™m going to just start calling you Sears or Kodak or Smith Carona. 1) ordered tv from Walmart.com Took days to hear I will get it in a week 2) got email saying â€œ must be home for signature for Delivery on 12/28 1-5 I waited 12/29 too giving you benefit of the doubt. 3) never arrived.

Her reply â€œ yesâ€ I respond, oh it doesnâ€™t seem like a professional way to answer a call , she responds. I didnâ€™t expect a customer to be on the phone 9) I explain to her I just wasted 2 days of my life waiting for this delivery. She said , I will get them to deliver it another time - 10) what ?? That is your response after me and my son waited for 2 days in the house over the holidays for a delivery that was promised for a 4 hour time frame in 12/28."

Was supposed to be delivered Dec 20 Customer service representative at customer service cancelled the order cause ""didn't take"". Please reorder. Wouldn't give me a supervisor. I stupidly reordered. Didn't take again. Next morning called again. this time got a supervisor and got gift cards and apologies and i stupidly again reordered.

Never going to use photo center again. Walmart S*CKS"
1616,45788,Abby Cyr,29/12/2019,Walmart,I ordered a candle before Christmas and it finally got sent to the store for pick up today. Well I go pick it up (30min) from my house and I open the box and it is all smashed up broken glass everywhere to the point all the little pieces cut my hand!!! I reached out to Walmart and all they did was say sorry oh we will place a new one! No rushed shipping and could not even be sent to my house now I have to wait another week to get it and have to go out of my way to pick this up! The two people I talked too could care less just wanted me to stop talking and go! Never again will I order from here
1617,45789,JoAnn Buck,29/12/2019,Walmart,"They sent one of my Christmas gifts to a store I don't even go to(Suppose to be delieved to my house). Showed pictures of items but, did electronical delivery. Acted like I was the problem when I reached out to the for assitance. No empathy, No making things right. They just mess everything up and expect you to fix it. No compensation, nothing."
1618,45790,Jamie,29/12/2019,Walmart,Walmarts return policy has gotten ridiculous! I bought my son an expensive game from there and tried to return it a couple days later cause he couldn't play it cause u needed WiFi for the game and they wouldn't let me return it they said cause it was open...all the stuff I've seen returned that was OPEN this was a joke!
1619,45791,M,29/12/2019,Walmart,"I went to your store located in dalton,GA & I did not feel very welcomed by an employee named Carol. They gave me attitude for just asking a question & continued on to talk about me to another employee. I do not appreciate this behavior & expected more."
1620,45792,Ki,29/12/2019,Walmart,"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I made 4 purchases and none of them were delivered or ready for pickup on time. My grandsonâ€™s bike had a peeling seat and filthy handlebars, needless to say that was a trip to return it(pointless to have it delivered). One item never made it to me, but the claim they had a signature. After investigation no signature. Pairing with Fed Ex was another horrible mistake. The deliveries are left outside without so much as a knock on the door. The service just sucks period. I will stick with Amazon"
1621,45793,AMW,29/12/2019,Walmart,"For the third time in 11 months I have observed the security guard(s) at the Perkins Road location in Stillwater, Oklahoma harass their customers. In each of these encounters, I have witnessed textbook examples of a proud and glib individual (i.e. Wal-Mart security) wield the thinnest of power and influence over normal, every day â€˜â€™Joes.â€™â€™ Or, stated another way, the security team at the Stillwater, Oklahoma Wal-Mart should be embarrassed, ashamed, and apologetic of their behavior. Or yet another way to put it is that a very small, insecure, pathetic twentysomething male got his rocks off by outright bothering people whoâ€”guessing by the of their car-full of itemsâ€”had just spent about two hundred bucks at the Stillwater Wal-Mart.  Itâ€™s weird, 25 years agoâ€”when I worked in the frozen food section at this very same locationâ€”I felt sorry for the storeâ€™s security guards because they had to thanklessly toil through their days as they tried to stop tricky, shifty shoplifters from stealing. Over the years itâ€™s been obvious to me that Wal-Mart security guards are less respectful and, more importantly, less impactful. Seriously, Wal-Mart should reassess the fiscal value their security teams bring to any respective store. Iâ€™m quite sure that, on occasion, a random theft has been thwarted and eve brought to justice. However, my recent experiences leave me no choice but to write this and to implore any one that might care to, please, please, reconsider your shopping at the Stillwater, Oklahoma Wal-Marts.  To be more specific, the first instance of harassment that I saw occurred about 11 months ago. A close friend of mine purchased an item in electronics at about 1:00 am. When we walked to the storeâ€™s main entrance/exit three people stopped my friend because he didnâ€™t have a receipt. The reason he didnâ€™t have a receipt is that the original sales associate in electronics had not provided my friend with a receipt. To make matters worse, after my friendâ€™s purchase the sales associate from electronics had gone on his lunch break so he couldnâ€™t vouch for us either. My friend was quite polite the entire time, despite me telling him we should go. After all, he HAD paid so the item was his. At that juncture, Wal-Mart had no business nor did they have a right to ask for a receipt. The item belonged to him. Is Wal-Mart also allowed to ask for receipts for the clothes in your back or for the things in your pockets? I was irate but my friend patiently endured the 40-minute detainment until the matter could be cleared. The second time I witnessed problems with Wal-Mart security was back in August 2019. I was in the self-checkout lines and, again, three different guards and/or managers had accused a customer of stealing. The customer, a sandy-haired blonde woman in her 20s, had made multiple purchases at the self checkout counter. Apparently Wal-Martâ€™s staff had no interest in ensuring whether or not a crime had been committed before theyâ€™d accused the woman of a crime. The lady kept saying, â€˜â€™I bought it. I paid. Iâ€™ve paid for everything.â€™â€™ But, nonetheless, the intrusive and invasive Wal-Mart employees dug through the womanâ€™s bags. They removed all her items and counted them as they referenced her receipts along the way. After about seven or eight minutes one of the managers muttered a half-hearted â€˜â€™sorry for the inconvenience, maâ€™am,â€™â€™ and then beckoned her to leave.  Finally, just yesterday I saw a security guard harassing three or four junior high girls (they were loosely chaperoned by one of the girlsâ€™ parents). The girls were in tears and clearly had done nothing wrong because, after all, if they had done something wrong then the local police would have been on their way. The Wal-Mart security guard said heâ€™d followed the girls around and that they had carried some item around the store and, GASP, had put the item back on a rack? When I walked by this particular conversation by the exit doors, it was obvious that the guard had nothing â€˜â€™onâ€™â€™ these young women. Otherwise the conversation wouldn't even be happening. If he had evidence against them then SPD would be on the way. Instead, the ridiculous (small) man stopped these teenagers just to beat his chest and try to make the girls feel scared and small. One girl just kept crying ''I just came for starbursts.'' It was disgusting. Anyone with an IQ over 75 would have recognize the manâ€™s wrong doing. Anyone with a bit of sympathy and empathy would have recognized the man just wanted to feel big for three minutes. He should be ashamed and fired. The event occurred about 11:30 pm on Saturday, December 28th. At the end of the interrogation the so-called â€˜â€™security guardâ€™â€™ just said, ''Okay. If I hear you did something this lady [pointing at the mother] shops here all the time.'' The ladies shuffled away and I told him he was â€˜â€™a piece of sh**â€™â€™ then he replied that I should move along or heâ€™d call the police. I told him what he did was wrong and that I was going to formally complain to corporate. His response was to call the local police on meâ€”or at least to pretend he was. I walked away assuring him of my intention to file a grievance against him. I do hope Wal-Mart recognizes that the security guard at their Stillwater, Oklahoma location gives the company a bad name. He makes them weak. He frightens, intimidates, and humiliates paying customers. Um, in what business model is this a viable behavior? On what planet is this a legitimate practice? Grow up dude. Do better Wal-Mart. In the meantime, I do hope those in Stillwater will reconsider spending their money at such an unstable, unsafe establishment."
1622,45794,Monica,29/12/2019,Walmart,"Very poor costumer service! They delayed my order three times and didn't even have the courtesy to advise me of the delays. Then I call to see where my order is and the guy simply says, ""oh yeah it's late. Sorry"". Never again will I order from walmart.com and I advise against anyone doing so."
1623,45795,Tehmina Khan,29/12/2019,Walmart,Walmart online shopping is the worst and I recommend that never ever use it. I ordered some beauty products online on Nov4 and now itâ€™s end of December I didnâ€™t receive my stuff. I called them 5 times. Every time I was told that higher management will resolve the issue within a week and now this is two months. At one point I was told to directly call the seller. Since I ordered from Walmart itâ€™s not my job to contact the seller. I am seriously thinking about contacting my lawyer. They are not even giving me my money. I am frustrated and very upset. Walmart sucks especially their online shopping service .
1624,43827,dawn fradera,29/12/2020,Walmart,If there was a zero star Iâ€™d give it a zero. They are trying to knock Amazon out the box. Not going to happen. I am canceling my service with them and their delivery arrive that that canâ€™t get right. Wish Amazon had a wholesale close to me. Lebanon pa Walmart has a bunch of kids working with no supervision and mess orders up all the time. Next day delivery my ass. Donâ€™t believe them. They deliver to you next day while your free trial is going on but just like cell phone service they offer you all the best as a new customer and screw you after because you are in a year subscription. Donâ€™t do it
1625,43828,Lynn Bryant,29/12/2020,Walmart,"Walmart needs to have a contact point for how well it is doing on Covid 19. I went to your Walmart in Lake Jackson, Texas Dec. 28, 2020 between 8:00 and 9:00 am. I planned to purchase 2 lbs of Deli ham. The staff that came up to help me had her mask hanging on her chin. I told her she could not help me. I went to the service desk and told them I want a person wearing a mask to help. The Lead over the area did meet me at the deli. She was wearing a mask. I asked her if it was protocol for the staff to wear their mask correctly. She said it was. I pointed out that the other staff was still not wearing her mask correctly. the lead said she had talked to the staff. The staff person was standing by the slicing machine moving her mask up and down with her hands to pantomime her mask would not stay up. The lead person said she was going to get the staff another mask. At that point I left. I have worn a mask since March, and have always been able to keep it up. Walmart apparently does not have appropriate mask readily available to its staff, and not trained their staff in pandemic hygiene. That a person would be allowed to wear a mask incorrectly, and display to a customer moving it up and down with the same hands that will get your order ready is not acceptable. I understand you cannot be responsible for all your customers, but you are responsible for your staff. I intend to spread this experience as far, and as often as possible."
1626,43829,Eric,29/12/2020,Walmart,"Terrible customer service - if you ever have an issue with an order, they will NOT resolve it for you. Ordered an item for pre-order 4 months ago, they delayed my shipment and are now selling it in stores. The expected shipment date remains 1.5 months ago (Nov 2020 vs Jan 2021) and is not updated remains ""in process"". Item is mostly sold out in retail already now with a few stores still in stock. Walmart can't even have a store ship the in stock item to fulfill my order because it's ""different fulfillment centers"".  Never shop here if you can shop at Amazon instead, Amazon always takes care of its customers. That is far from true for Walmart. Never again."
1627,43830,Neil Allen,29/12/2020,Walmart,Ordered photo paper 30 days ago and haven't received it. Contacted WalMart help and they replied with a generic excuse. Won't refund amount I paid so have to contact credit card company. Will never order from WalMart.com again!
1628,43831,Elizabeth Holden,29/12/2020,Walmart,Stop using FedEx to send packages. Every time I order they deliver a week later than they are supposed to and their tracking is a joke. I actually paid more for something just to order it from somewhere else because you ship everything with FedEx and I canâ€™t run a business never sure when my stuff will show up! Get it together!
1629,43832,Jessica Colella,29/12/2020,Walmart,"Ordered 4 bluetooth dongles for PS4 for my whole family for Christmas on November 18. Received items November 23. Opened on December 25 & tried them out December 28. They did not work with any of the 3 brands earbuds used. Return policy for Christmas was 90 days, so contacted them for return. Will not take return or give refund because was not actually Walmart selling item but one of their third party vendors. Was not aware was 3rd party or never would have purchased. TOTAL SCAM. Walmart should use same policy for 3rd party & should make it clear you are ordering from one of those scammers to avoid this issue. Bad business Walmart... But you got your money, so why care."

1632,41810,Gary Brown,29/12/2021,Walmart,I bought a pair of eyeglasses from your optical department you guys are the biggest thieves I think I've known in the times that I bought glasses which is most of my life you guys take the cake for rip off you ruined one of my lenses and had to replace it when you replaced it you replaced it with inferior crap I can see why you have such bad reviews your service is terrible and you could care less about your reviews I can see that because you probably won't let me submit this one LOL
1633,41811,Justin,29/12/2021,Walmart,Small items work well. If you are in the market for a larger item so not buy from Walmart. I purchased a TV for Christmas on Black Friday which was supposed to deliver by Dec 10th. After 8 calls with customer services and 4 more with the delivery company I was promised it would be there before the 25th. Well itâ€™s not the 28th and they lost the order. They did order a replacement and itâ€™s another month out. Worst experience I have ever had buying an item. More than 12 hrs on the phone trying to resolve for kids Christmas.
1634,47236,Mike Giuliano,30/12/2016,Walmart,"My first large purchase to Walmart, and my last. I bought some Bose 35 Headphones from them, and ON THE AD on line, it clearly states ""30 day money back guarantee."" There are no exceptions listed of any kind. Then once the product was MAILED, it get a notice explaining me that this was a third party seller (which was listed on the original ad), but that this seller's return policy is 14 days PLUS a restocking fee. There is NO WAY to know that until you actually have your order shipped, and then it is too late. Wow, just wow. Why would you put ""30 day money back guarantee"" right under the product if it wasn't true. Serves me right for leaving the class of on line ordering- Amazon. I will never give another cent to walmart.com."

1637,46891,Jennifer Rabon,30/12/2018,Walmart,"Customer service is just lowsy. The cashiers are disengaged... the floor clerks are not helpful and just rude... the management has excuses for everything and are defensive and unwilling to solve an issue, but instead want to argue with the customer. It's not worth the savings you see. I'd rather spend a little more and get the customer service I deserve by patronizing your store."
1638,46892,Natalie Welch,30/12/2018,Walmart,I absolutely think that walmart should completely redo their hiring standards
1639,45785,Klaus Shitzspritzer,30/12/2019,Walmart,"Horrible experience all together. I have tried various Walmarts in different areas. I had a terrible time with the photo department, I ended up getting the store manager to retrieve my photos after about 30 minutes, another store was trashed filthy and smelly. There are lots of videos on Youtube of people playing fart pranks in the store and being obscene over the paging system. The Waltons keep a very low profile, I can see why."

1641,43822,KK,30/12/2020,Walmart,"Never again will I order from Walmart.com! I ordered a tricycle as a surprise for my granddaughterâ€™s birthday. My first order was cancelled by Walmart stating that the fraud department found unusual activity on the order! Are you serious? I contacted, through live chat, a representative who told me to reorder the item after an hour of my call to them but within 24 hours using the same device I used for my original order. I didnâ€™t do that. Instead, my husband placed the order on his computer. Since it was a gift, it was stated that the tricycle would be shipped in a Walmart box so the recipient wouldnâ€™t see what was inside. The tricycle arrived in record fast time but the tricycle was not in a boxðŸ˜¡ It was left outside the house with no box, paperwork or instructions allowing anyone to see it (including my Granddaughter). Anyone could have picked it up and walked away with it. My husband checked the delivery email which was supposed to have a delivery snapshot of the purchase...there was no such thing in the email. How does this company stay in business with this kind of service? I wish I had read the reviews before I placed this first time order. Lesson learned! Beware if you order this type item from Walmart.com!"
1642,43823,Monica,30/12/2020,Walmart,"Walmart you just lost about 75 million customers and you can thank your own Twitter account for this. You lost a long time shopper, I will be giving my Business to HEB now. I know of many more people who are no longer supporting Walmart."
1643,43824,Mary King,30/12/2020,Walmart,"I purchased an iPad from Walmart, which was expected to arrive December 16, never did. The Walmart representatives kept on telling me it will arrive soon. On December 23rd I was finally told I can cancel the order and reorder, I did. I was told I would receive my new order December 29th, I didnâ€™t. This was a gift to my daughter for Christmas, and though I felt bad having to tell her she would get her gift until after Christmas, I had to let her know. Well today I called Walmart to find out what the delay was in me receiving the second iPad I ordered and they told me, to my surprise, â€œthe warehouse did not confirm the order, I will have to cancel the second order and order a third time.â€ Iâ€™m hurt because, from my first purchase to now, Walmart did not take any time to give me as much as a courtesy call, to let me know what had transpired with my order, I had to reach out to them throughout."
1644,43825,Michelle Johnson,30/12/2020,Walmart,"I had a bad experience at the Walmart on Columbus blvd.Vision center. Upon arriving was told paper work needed to be filled out. As I retrieved new gloves to be sure of no cross contamination from my purse. Due to Covid 19. Was immediately told by the lady that there stuff was clean and I could not wear gloves in the back when seeing doctor. As I was seated in the front waiting area. Then was given a ""dirty look"". (Unprofessional) She was very rude. Then gave paper work to next patient and skipped over me. After sitting in area a lil longer was denied care/visit canceled. Stating the doctor would not be seeing me. No signs were posted that gloves were not allowed. And furthermore does this grant access to not be seen by doctor based on wearing gloves in the waiting area during these crucial times. Poor customer service."

You pick what you want and out you go with no queues, credit card etc. I wish there were more items (particularly warm and cooked recently) but otherwise - a wonderful experience.

1648,41806,Susan Manson Dixson,30/12/2021,Walmart,"First I would like to say that Laura and Mercy saved the day during my horrible Walmart online experience during Christmas season 2021. I made a mistake by putting the wrong address on my delivery when I updated my new home address. I contacted Walmart and provided everything they asked from me to verify who I was and they pretty much called me a liar a thief a con-artist and with the supervisor hanging up on me. I called and I was told that I need to contact the police. I was furious then because my husband is the police and I worked for the court system dealing with fraud cases and knew that they were able to handle my situation but because of what I believe racial discrimination they did not want to redirect my shipment because they instantly believed I was a fraud. I professionally educated the supervisor and informed him that all black people are not frauds. I told him I was educated I told him I was a business owner and I told him that if he did not handle the situation that I did have the proper connections to sue Walmart for discrimination because previously I spoke with a representative who said that they would not redirect my futons because I lived in the metropolitan Detroit area. That statement right there is pure discrimination. I was able and willing to provide the credit card that I used, my current driver's license that had the correct address, the order number and whatever else they needed to prove that I was indeed the customer who purchased the futons. I have never been more insulted and treated so badly by Walmart customer service. The two weeks that I contacted Walmart I remain professional because I myself have had over 20 years experience in customer service and I know how difficult it can be to deal with an irate customer. But it took me to step out of my professionalism and educate them on my rights as a customer and my community. I eventually did get to speak with Laura and then later I spoke with Mercy these two ladies at Walmart were the only ones that believed me and was willing to accept the proof that I had to provide. They also were the only ones that was willing to go on a three-way call with FedEx. FedEx had told me numerous times that all they needed was Walmart to call them to have the futons redirected but because Walmart refused to believe me and at one point Laura had given me a number so they would be able to pull up my case and the guy that I spoke with tried to tell me that I was lying and that they didn't not have case numbers. At this point I was completely upset and told him that he was the one that was lying that is when he put the supervisor on the phone and after an unsuccessful conversation with the supervisor the supervisor hung up on me. Later that day I spoke with Mercy and she completed my request and within two to three hours what the supervisor said was impossible to do I had my three futons on my front porch. Again a big shout out to Laura and Mercy at Walmart for saving my Christmas event."
1649,41808,Lyle Bialk,30/12/2021,Walmart,"Walmart has lost an online customer with these ludicrous return policies and their refusal to allow exchanges. I ordered Wrangler jeans for my brother in law for Christmas. They donâ€™t fit. He wants to exchange them at a store so he can try them on. Walmart doesnâ€™t allow that. I have to return the jeans to the store, then wait 10 days or more for the refund to be processed. This is NOT acceptable, and I will never shop for anything at Walmart.com again."

And Walmart responds to our loyalty by calling us losers.  Well maybe the 75 million Conservative shoppers need to shop at other stores who appreciate their dollars and loyalty.  Remember Walmart it is the Democrats like Hillary and Barack who make fun of your Brand and would rather die than set foot in a Walmart store.
1663,43818,Alice C.,31/12/2020,Walmart,Really bad online and offline shopping experience. Incompetent CSRs don't have the knowledge to assist through the phone or in the store. Slow ship times. Just terrible experiences. Never giving Walmart anymore business.
1664,43819,Anthony B.,31/12/2020,Walmart,"The stuff they sell at Walmart is okay, sometimes aisles are empty. You have to pay shipping if you buy stuff less than $35. I don't go to Walmart a lot, causes their locations are terrible. They don't have a Walmart in Rural areas like San Francisco and Seattle, you have to go outside the city. Not like Target, there is stores inside big cities like L.A. and NYC. Walmart is like a neighborhood and suburb store, not fully everywhere. I like it that it's international, they have it in China."

1667,36224,Suor K.,31/12/2018,Amazon Go,"The original Amazon Go store, located next to the Spheres, is as much a tourist attraction as it is a grocery store. On one of my recent visits to Seattle, I remembered that it was open to the public so I had to take a look inside. Assuming that you already have an Amazon account, all you have to do is download the app and setup a payment method.  I brought my own tote bag, but if you don't have one, they are complimentary tote bags available. I took one as a souvenir. I made a quick loop around the store and was surprised at how small it is. The food options consist of prepared foods, packaged foods (e.g. chocolate), and drinks. I guess that makes sense because it's supposed to be a grab and go store.  I ended up buying something just because I wanted to see if it would charge me for the right item (it did). I picked up an Amazon Go branded Theo chocolate bar, 70% dark chocolate, with sea salt. I didn't like it."

Either things are on the shelves that they cant sell because they are reserved for sales and werent supposed to be on the shelves, to WalMart.com not having accurate inventory as to what is in the store and tells you to pick up by 4pm, then at 355 its postponed, then the next day its cancelled. Cant call OGP because I guess they arent trained on phones yet, tried 11 times over two days. Called management 4 times, the phone picked up and was hung up immediately. Electronics said they only have one of the type of item I am trying to purchase and nothing in stock as to the item I am trying to buy. I walked in the store, there was nine, NINE, right there on top shelf. I will continue going to Target as WalMart has forced me to do since November 22nd. First you leave your prices where they are and have me do the job you used to pay employees to do, nice passing on the savings vs keeping the profits, now I have to do OGP and electronics jobs too? Thanks for making the final decision for me, I wont be back."

1671,41801,Holy Moly,31/12/2021,Walmart,"You may end up with broken product and good luck getting any kind of refund. I've spent over a month and close to 20 hours on phone support and emails trying to get a refund for a mini clothes washer that stopped working. The warranty is for one year and the manufacturer said contact seller. I contacted the seller and we did troubleshooting and determined the item is defective. The seller didn't want me to return the item and agreed to send a refund. The seller can't send the refund because Walmart won't allow refund on purchase post 6 months and says contact Walmart to have them initiate the refund. Walmart 800 number/support said contact the seller. This back and forth loop went on for a couple of weeks. Finally Walmart agreed to refund the purchase price and said wait 48 hours. I've waited 48 hours and no refund so I call back and told to wait another 48 hours! This happens over and over and over and over, for over a month!!!!!!! This item isn't cheap and now I'm out the $ purchase price. I had already replaced this washer(and not from Walmart!!!! Never again!!!!) having expected the refund, which never came, and so my Christmas budget was robbed and some friends never got a Christmas gifts from me, I tell them about Walmart's terrible conduct and and warm them about buying stuff from Walmarts website. I tell everyone that will listen about the risk of buying from Walmart. Thank you Walmart for the crap service and for ruining Christmas!!! In the future I'll be shopping anyplace but Walmart and I will be changing my FSA account from Walmart to CVS . Walmart will not get one more cent from me!!!!!!! I hope Walmart thinks that raping their customer during the holidays was worth the investment."
1672,41802,Ready to fire someone,31/12/2021,Walmart,I am absolutely sick of problems from this company. It's like they have no common sense and decided to open a business last week but they have been around for a long time. I am not leaving anything significant here simply because Kroger will now be my official food source and if they are lucky they won't here from me again because they pissed me off at least 6 times alone last night. Good riddance you incompetent fools!
1673,41804,Mikki Drew Barrett,31/12/2021,Walmart,"I have been a customer of Walmart for more than 30 years but after my last three experiences with their online grocery delivery, I will no longer purchase anything from this company no matter how good their pricing may be. I held a Walmart+ membership where I pay about $14 a month to have my groceries delivered for free (obviously not free if I'm paying a fee but this is how they market it) Unfortunately, they require you spend at least $35 each shopping trip in addition to the monthly fee or you are charged $5 for the delivery. I don't like this requirement but accepted it for the convenience of not having to shop. What I did not know until recently is the orders are sent to what they deem is the closest store to you even if you have specifically requested delivery from another store. The store my groceries are delivered from is not the store that is clearly listed as my chosen store on the website. Recently, after planning meals, I placed an order for the needed ingredients. The order included six items from the meat department. Of those six only two were in stock and both of them were prepackaged deli type foods. Unfortunately, I was not notified of this until my delivery was on the way! What grocery store does not keep cubed beef for stew on hand?? This left me with items I could not use timely because I needed the meat. As it turned out when I questioned why such a large store did not have the meat they always have when I physically go into the store I was told my order was routed to another store which I never shop at. The order I placed a week or so before the above order was never delivered because a Door Dash Driver never arrived to pick up the groceries. I had to reorder the next day. at that time, I requested a member of management contact me. To this day, I have yet to hear from a store manager or a regional manager. Today was the last straw. I placed an order early am and was unable to schedule delivery until between 3-4 pm because slots were full (my order was placed at 10 am). I get a phone call at 3 pm from a door dash driver insisting that I put in the wrong address because his GPS system took him to 111 Doctors Way instead of 111 Sam's Drive. I have received multiple deliveries to this new address both from Walmart and pretty much all the mail carriers. He basically kept insisting I did not know my own address. The situation kept escalating until he told me he was not going to deliver my groceries and was taking it back to the store. I immediately called Walmart and before I could get to a CS representative he had dumped my groceries at someones door, snapped a photo and entered it as delivered (probably his own front door). The CS I was talking to placed my groceries back in the cart and was going to have them delivered properly only to be told in the system that there were no time slots available and I would have to wait another day. She then placed me on hold to contact the store to see that my food would be delivered promptly. After waiting, and waiting, I suddenly heard someone say hello can I help you. She had transferred me to the store and had hung up! The poor clerk was clueless and when I requested to speak to a manager he told me there was no manager but a team lead. I asked to speak to them. He left the phone and a minute or so later they disconnected me. I called Walmarts 800 number again and it was finally arranged to refund me the charges for the groceries I did not get. This whole process took well over an hour out of my workday and I never got my groceries! I then went online to cancel my plus membership only to find I could not do so. I had to call them again and then spent another 15 minutes answering questions as to why I wanted to cancel. I was also told at this point that they could not guarantee that a member of management would reach out to me. What in the world has happened to customer service? It's pretty obvious we are not valued anymore!"
1674,47346,Michael Deterding,13/02/2014,Walmart,"Six p$eudo-american$ have more wealth than sixty percent of Real Americans, yet they continue to exploit the entire nation by compelling their grunt employees to subsist on minimum compensation that does not even afford them the opportunity to shop in the store the work within. These are the six heirs of the Walmart Empire. Your tax dollars continue to enable them to own much of what you see as you look out the window. That is because these employees are emergency room visitiors, (Walmart has no health care for 38 hour per week employees) . and their wages are so low that they qualify for food stamps, and other taxpayer funded assistance. The Congress (GOP controlled house) is not voting on anything relevant, I voted with my feet, and wal ked out of Wal mart,, and Sam's ( same six despots ) , and into Costco, where employees are likely to be more fairly compensated , and therefore not such a burden upon us taxpayers."

Only because they never did anything was why the promotion expired. I tried over and over and over again. Worst customer service ever.

The smug supervisor (Macey) that I had them call after 30 minutes of a electronics specialist having no clue how to verify the price of a laptop was the worst customer care I have ever seen. They had 2 laptops mounted to a display with 2 prices one was $199 and the other $549 after spending about another half hour wating for him and two others to sort out whats what I was very irritated. So I told him I felt they should honor the price they CLEARLY had on display for one of those two laptops. No apologies and a solid ""im im not gonna do that"" is all I got from him. At that point I told him thats not right that I have wasted a hour of my time for your stores mistake and you wont honor the price displayed. That is false advertisement. I asked isnt there something you can do. His reply was "" I can fix the take but I'm not giving you a $500 laptop for $200. His attitude was clearly meant to make me feel stupid and I left the store in a walk of shame because I couldn't afford $500. It was humiliating and I will be calling corperate. Their is no such thing as customer service even more now because almost all the registers are self checkout too. Like what happened to walmart EARNING the money we work hard for? Sad world we live in."
1708,43586,Evelyn,14/02/2021,Walmart,"I'm disappointed with walmart membership program. I decided to do the month to month payment to give it a try. I CANCELLED! I received a delivery with items just in bags in the rain left at my door. No text or notice just an email. Another order delivered to the wrong house! Photo sent (10 pm ) in an email of my item in a bag at someone else's door. Email of another delivery coming early! When I call C service, told isn't coming for another three days! Pick up at my area walmart store 1091 Mill Creek Rd Allentown PA (wow!) Regular shoppers park in Pick Up Zone Area not a care. It takes long (freezing cold) waiting in car just to get my groceries. And it's not even busy! I call the phone number provide in parking spot to find out if they know I'm there. It goes straight to automatic voicemail! I'm looking at my phone with the options app has given me 1.Color of car. 2. Parking Spot number or other (spot with higher number not as a selection) My SUV is silver. In spot (Other)14. A male associate comes out takes my name runs back inside. Wait some more and I get my stuff. Get home and the thing walmart texted me they didn't have I find in bag. Plus the substituted item. So walmart you gave me the ""free item"" I paid for the substitute. At least I didn't pay for something I didn't get, right? Walmart I'm telling you this because this ( online grocery pick up) has happened twice. To many errors and inconveniences have been done from your part. You should take accountablity and make some corrections. Check out the reviews from my local walmart store. It surprised me that I had an online grocery pick up experience so similar to other community shoppers."
1709,40863,Ange Jones,14/02/2022,Walmart,"Honestly they don't even deserve one star. How ridiculous. I bought a new computer and since I didn't have problems with it until after the 30-day ""window"" I can't return it. I bought a brand new computer and it's like they sold me some refurbished crap. The computer is not even 6 months old and I can't use it without keeping it plugged in because the battery goes in about an hour, the screen freezes it's extremely slow.. I have to boot it up 30 minutes before I actually want to use it. Had these problems happened right away I would have turned around and returned it but everything was fine at first. Of course Walmart's hands are tied?! Give me a break I just wanted to turn it back in and exchange it for a computer that actually worked!!!! Screw you Walmart."
1710,40864,Jaclyn,14/02/2022,Walmart,"On 2/13/2022 I put in an order from Walmart for pick up. The pick-up got redirected to a different Walmart without anyone notifying me (this is the second time that has happened) I was running late to the second store because it was so far away. I tried calling over 5 times before 8:00 and no one answered the phone. I called the front and the pickup. When I got to the second store at 1800 NE 12th Ave #3877 I was told they could not get my groceries so I asked to talk to the manager. Wanda, the manager said to me that no one could get them for me tonight. I preseeded to ask if she had a key or if anyone else was able to go back there and get it since I had already paid for it. She said no again at that point I got upset and she told me that she was thinking of someone who could possibly help me but no longer would help me because I was upset I couldn't get it. She said even if she could help me she wouldn't. I then asked for her name and she ignored me and would not look at me. I read her name tag and left. I had to call to get a full refund and I canceled my membership. If this is how Walmart runs their stores with no one answering the phones, changing pick-up stores with no notice, and such rude management then I no longer want to step foot in a Walmart again. And if nothing gets done to solve this then it is even worse than I thought."

1734,40859,Arthur Alan Shugars,15/02/2022,Walmart,"I purchased a Cooler Master NotePal X3 - Laptop Cooling Pad with 200mm Blue LED Fan $67.72/EA Qty: 1  on 1/24/2022 with Order 2952262-769067 sold to and shipped by a 3rd-Party seller ""The Caidan Shop"" (out of China. I got a 4-day delay in the tracking in Houston, and when my supposed package finally came with the corresponding tracking # I only receieved a ""Thank You"" Card and no Laptop Cooling Pad. I then had a heck of a time navigating the Wal-Mart.com site to report this and finally got a hold of a customer rep named Miles, whom assured me that I would get a refund. This refund has never been credited to my account as of yet, and I will give it another day for the outside possability that my item actually does get delivered, but I'm not holding my breathe, as I did some research on the entity that is supposed to deliver this item, aka DropAir. Based on a large majority of reviews of their service, I can pretty much expect that my item will never come, or if it does get delivered, it will be delivered somewhere else.

1778,36317,Jennifer N.,16/02/2018,Amazon Go,"Definitely a cool experience compared to your average grocery store. I stopped by on a Friday afternoon and there was a small line gathered outside. Luckily, the line moved pretty quickly, so we were able to get inside and escape the cold. The employees outside hand out reusable grocery bags to place your purchases in, and you have to download the Amazon Go app and log into your Amazon account in order to enter. The store was the size of a convenience store, and it sold snacks, drinks, alcohol, ready made meals, meat, bread, and pastries. My sister and I made a full circle around the store within 3 minutes, and left with a bag of chips, a case of Bundaberg peach flavored fruit drink, an aloe vera drink, a bar of chocolate, and a souvenir bottle. All in all, our trip only took 5 minutes since we didn't have to wait to check out!"
1779,36318,Brendan c.,16/02/2018,Amazon Go,"The novelty is high here. Fun way to shop, a Seattle only experience and/or yeah another sign Amazon is taking over your last life. Pick your reason to go. It's a small convenience store but one with a lot of fresh meals to go. Coming from Philly I will argue the Italian Sandwich is just wrong but the selection is wide.  It's a great place to grab breakfast or lunch if you work in the area. Even better is the meal boxes you can take home to cook if your out of meal ideas (cheaper than some box food services.)"

1781,40858,Kevin,16/02/2022,Walmart,"I purchased a car battery and some tires from Walmart less than 6 months ago. I took my car to a reputable mechanic a few weeks ago. He told me that ""the garbage Walmart battery was dead"" and that it had taken the starter with it ($350). He jumped my car and I was able to get it to Sam's club to get gas (10 mins away). It was dead when I tried to start my car and had to get it jumped again to get it to Walmart which theoretically has a 1 year warranty on batteries.  They told me that it would be several hours before they could charge the battery to which I replied that I had to pick up my kids. They recommended that I purchase a battery and that they would refund it out when the battery report came back good. I had them swap it and was only 10 minutes late to pick up my kids (1.5 hrs total).  They called me that night and told me that the battery tested good so I told them I'd be up in the morning to have them swap it back out. I arrived in the morning and when it was my turn in queue (90 mins or so) they told me that I now owned 2 Walmart batteries and that they wouldn't honor the warranty. I refused this, have no contract with them, and simply disputed the charge with my credit card company.  This testimony is being written on the day after the event."

Things to note before your visit:  Make sure you've downloaded the amazon go app and log in.  If you're going with someone, make sure that they download the app too, or you'll have to scan them in with your app and then scan yourself in.  It was a great experience and I can't wait until they bring these stores out to Texas"

Well I did that and the store would not honor the refund even thought I had a receipt and was told to call customer service back. Called customer service back and they told me that the would speak to the store manager. I show up and the store manager says that she didn't know what was going on but they cannot accept the return. I will never deal with this company again!
1791,46847,GRETA HOLLIWAY,18/02/2019,Walmart,"Honestly This company have lack of heart since Sam Walton passed away, its like nobody cares, cash registers are lacking people to assist customers, especially if they have 13 available and only 2 are open for about 30 people per line to check out. The laywaway program should never been fully eliminated, plus all the charity programs Walmart once over seen no longer exist. How can this be, when it used to be a place where everybody once had a since of pride when shopping there. Walmart needs to bring the heart back and show Sam Walton that together his retail can gain respect from people who truly love shopping at this retail store."

I started using my coupons. 4 worked and the other coupons needed assistance. The manager came and said that self-checkout cannot take these coupons. She told me to go to the regular stand. She canceled all of my products. I went to the different cash register, stood in line for the second time for about 10 minutes. After the products were scanned, I gave the coupons to the cashier. She looked at them, started scanning them. Coupons that are more than $5 need to be inputted as full assisted manufacturer coupons. I tried explaining this to her. Then the manager from earlier came and said that the politics of our Walmart does not accept coupons more than $5 that doesn't scan. I have been using these coupons with no problems in Walmart of Roseville, Sacramento, Marysville. These are regular manufacturer coupons. They are not printed or downloaded. They are ordinary coupons.  After this, the coupons were not scanned, they did not use full assist as I was suggesting as other Walmarts do, they just canceled everything that I wanted to buy. After I said that I will call Walmart Corporations, they started laughing at me. This is discrimination to laugh at an individual who has broken English. If you don't like my English, please give me a Translator. After this I got really sad, my husband's blood pressure went up. We went to a different grocery store Winco and were able to use our coupons with no problem.

Pickup employee said his shows FEB 18 and there is nothing they can do even though they have tons of PS4 controllers...had I just walked into the store I would have been in and out in a few minutes. Everything said order now and pickup today. Had I received any update or notification of 18th I would have just bought elsewhere. Never again! Convenience and customer service is bad."

1803,40855,Sanjoy Ghosh,18/02/2022,Walmart,"The most horrible experience in online shopping ever I have had. I placed an order for a TV online on Boxing day (ORDER #5312132001197). I tried cancelling it next day by calling customer service. They said they would put a request to cancel the order. But it did not happened. I called 3 more times. However, the TV was shipped out in the 1st week of January. I called customer service and they advised to refuse deliver. I did that (attached picture). I was charged 75 dollars for delivery. I have called 4 more times and the money has not been refunded. I know the whole TEAM of Walmart customer Service in India (I am an Indian and I know the accent)..they have no power and no one on the Canadian side listens to them. They will say that your case has been escalated but NOTHING WILL HAPPEN. I have 6 escalation numbers so far (220208-003486, 220218-003802 etc.)...Those are meaningless. You will be told that someone from Walmart will call you but NO calls will come. Please pray that I get my money back. WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN. Will pay a little extra to buy the stuff somewhere else."

As per social media the decision was made by corporate office. It is now a requirement you must be able to lift up to 25 lbs and be able to write reports. Unfortunately he is not able to do these tasks due to his medical history. How is this fare? Shame on you wal-mart! I'm moving on to Target. How can these people sleep at night!"

Is there anyway I can pay FedEx to deliver they at least leave it at the door which is what I need.even Amazon now takes picture of the door delivery I get a choice with Amazon where I want my pkg delivered this free delivery really stinks the p.o. is lazy.but with Amazon asking where to deliver it. It actually goes to my door.I wish walmart would do what Amazon did for customers
1808,45650,Christina B.,19/02/2020,Walmart,Good service. My order was delivered on time. Can't complain

1810,45652,ilovepuffins,19/02/2020,Walmart,"I have had a compelling desire to share my feelings and thoughts on my shopping experiences with a particular Walmart employee whom has provided exemplary service unfailing time and time again. Lijilijanana who works in the Prince George Walmart produce department has always answered all questions with obvious knowledge of her products giving much appreciated advice. She is warm, friendly and obviously works hard to keep the shelves stocked with the best products. When she is on shift you can see the cleanliness and organization. I could say much more but what I have expressed should suffice in the expression of my gratitude for her service. I would recommend her to anyone anywhere as a great employee. Thank you kindly and sincerely for your time and consideration . Yours truly Lynda Huble."
1811,45653,Not Leviathan,19/02/2020,Walmart,"Working at Wal-Mart was the worst job I've ever had. The store managers (at least at the store I worked at) didn't do anything other than threaten to fire me multiple times for doing my job. I should clarify, when I started I was told by a manager that unloading the truck, and doing break packs was done specific way, I followed directions and was praised by that specific manager for getting my work not only DONE, but done correctly and before schedule, however about a month into working there another Manager told me I was doing everything wrong, and that I would be fired if I didn't do it correctly. When I informed them that ""so and so"" said that the way I was doing it was correct, and that ""so and so"" was the one who trained me on how to do it, they flipped out and basically threatened me yet again that if I talked back to them i'd lose my job.  About a month later someone joined the team and was doing fine, but then the pressure that the managers gave was too much and they quick not even 2 weeks into the job.  On my third month I was honestly starting to give up as well, I was enjoying the job, but the managers ALWAYS threatened me and other co-workers out of our jobs if the truck (even if it was a two truck night) wasn't done by 5pm we'd get fired, or that there would be consequences.  About 4 months in I put in my two week notice, in which on my last day I had about 5-7 other co-workers tell me that they're going to try and find another job because the way they've been treated isn't right, and that because I was leaving I gave them that push to leave. People that have been working there for years, left because of the stuff their managers did finally got to them.  So unless you want to work at a place that pays you 11.00 USD an hour, but slowly takes away your mental health, and your co-workers mental health I'd advice you to please go look somewhere else. Because a Toxic work environment for a company that punishes it's workers for taking time off for family deaths, or personal health related issues, is NOT a company to look forward to."
1812,45654,Carl S,19/02/2020,Walmart,"Walmart.com would not price match an item because ""Only 5 in stock"". The item was $379.99 , I found the same item locally for $249.99. I'll bet they will still have ""Only 5 in stock"" next week."
1813,36343,Mia C.,19/02/2018,Amazon Go,"Was pretty excited about this experience - more for the touristy ""I have never tried this before"" aspect, than the ""I need to pick up a few things"" experience.  You download the special app, scan your personalized code code (you can even scan for a few other people if you're all on one bill) and head into the store. You pick up the things you desire - from grab-and-go lunch options like salads and sandwiches to regular convenience store fare like chips and snacks, to ready-to-cook meal kits and pretty decent bottles of wine.  Felt a bit like shoplifting, putting things in my shopping bag and just walking out. 5(ish) minutes later, I had a receipt on my phone (and they do give you options to ask for a refund just in case, since it is technology after all and even cyborgs make mistakes).  Don't know if I would stop in for groceries per se, but would definitely take out-of-towners as a tourist experience!"
1814,36347,Cynthia P.,19/02/2018,Amazon Go,Very cool experience to shop and just walk out. Looking forward to more stores moving towards this directions.
1815,36367,Amita J.,19/02/2018,Amazon Go,"Such a convenience especially when you're on the go. Awesome to see how well this was executed. They have employees preparing the meals which you can see from the outside. Also, their freshly made burrata sandwich is delicious!"
1816,36391,Aileen P.,19/02/2018,Amazon Go,"Awesome awesome awesome! Such a great experience, went today for a quick stop to check it out and was pleasantly surprised. There was a bit of a line out the door, but it moved fairly reasonably. Once we were inside, it's pretty small, but it's a great place to grab a quick meal for those on the go. My favorite purchase at the store was a meal kit. Can't wait to go back!"
1817,43575,Donalisa Santos,19/02/2021,Walmart,"If you plan on returning on Walmart.com. Don't bother purchasing from Walmart.com. Customer service didn't even order the pickup when she said she did, cause Fed Ex never came to pick it up called Fed Ex they said they never had a pick order for my item. Then the next day they scheduled another pick up with USPS and they never arrived. Wasted my 2 days time in a row. This has been nothing but a BIG HASSEL!!! And HEADACHE!!!! I am never going to order with them again!!! INCOMPETENT WORKERS AT WAL MART.COM CUSTOMER SERVICE."
1818,43576,Jerl Pippins,19/02/2021,Walmart,"Walmart in Temple Texas has got to be the worst Walmart anywhere. they have lettuce down through covid with their stupid policies only routing people through one door so everybody is together getting sick. And now everybody's been snowed in for a week but the snow is melting the ice is gone the roads are clear, and Walmart's the only one not open. HEB is open Aldi's grocery stores open corner stores are open but not Walmart. Walmart has led the people of Texas down specifically Temple Texas too many times I'm tired of Walmart. I wish Sam Walton had never died because his kids are ignorant!!!"
1819,43577,Dj Kim,19/02/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a hair care product through Walmart online store. When it was delivered, the box said there were 4 units, but only 1 was inside. Had to make MANY phone calls to get the partial refund (everytime I called, they said someone will get back to me, but they never did). Later, I received another invoice from FedEx, asking me to pay over $100 for customs fee. That was based on the assumption that I received all 4 units. I had to call Walmart again to ask for an amended receipt for 1 unit only, so I can prove to the Customs that I should only pay the customs fee for 1 unit. Walmart made me call many times again. Every time I called, they promised that they would resolve it in a few days and will get back to me. Never happened. Everytime I called, they greeted ""what is the issue sir?"". Every phone call was very long and, to obtain a receipt, I am doing it over and over again, getting nowhere. I seriously don't know how a company like this still survives. I always shop through Amazon, but first time through Walmart. I never will again. And I am telling other shoppers to be aware. If you want at least basic customer service, avoid Walmart online store. I am going to file a complaint to Better Business Bureau."
1820,43578,Caltek USA,19/02/2021,Walmart,"I purchased electric bike from Walmart. The bike broke after month and a half. Since it is sold by ""third party"" which practically not exist I paid to Walmart. The ""third party"" never respond to my calls either to Walmart calls. I stuck with the bike and Walmart is doing NOTHING!!!! Do not buy any product from walmart unless they carry it in their stores."

1822,43580,negar shaghadami,19/02/2021,Walmart,I had the worst experience ever in my life when i ordered an indoor cycling items with the brand of sunny health with 15 days delayed and totaly poor quality after i received it in to compare the description on the website.Each time i called the customer service and transfered to the supervisor they were unknowledgable about the exact date of delivery and even they changed the tracking system information on the system which is quite a shame when they realized i am following up that particular case.I lost my trust to order any items onlie through walmart website and to all customer services they served you me with wrong and inaccurate responses.
1823,43581,Holly Van Buskirk,19/02/2021,Walmart,Very bad experience. Credit card was hacked from 3 party seller but makes it look like you are ordering from Walmart. Inferior product so tried return items at store and told for a monthly on a weekly basis to come back as paper work on their end had not arrived-whatever that means.. Finally called them and they were no help saying I had to mail back product to some place in US and pay for shipping myself which would cost more than product. Closing my account and will never order from them again and will not go to the store. Stick with Costco. Way better policy.
1824,40854,stan Holmes da maN,19/02/2022,Walmart,The flickering on the website causes migraines for certain people. I thought it was fixed by now but I guess not. I'm done with trying to ordering anything from the site.

1826,45646,Roman's Reviews,20/02/2020,Walmart,"Walmart,... Huge corporation with such a minimal point classification,.. Perhaps this is one of the key factors behind their lack of interest in customer service.. I assume given their magnitude in terms of their economical status they don't bother with consumer reviews, whether positive or negative.. Which is unfortunate given the importance of customer satisfaction in every aspect. It's not just about providing the consumer with affordable pricing, it's also about providing good customer service in every aspect,.. Such as customer relations, technical, etc. As a consumer I am aware that there's no such thing as perfect service, there might be situations were the sales associate is not fully aware of certain items, or store policies,.. However if the associates manifest that they're forthcoming in providing the best service, by inquiring, researching, possessing good communication skills, etc.. With this it would make a world of difference, improving the quality of service tremendously. Despite the lack of product quality by manufacturer,.. In addition, the associates in the customer service area with their return policy issues, Perhaps most of us would appreciate for the policy to be Modified a bit, but once again this could be bypassed without any inconvenience if and when The customer service Rep would simply be courteous, professional, positive demeanor, etc... etc.... As a result the consumer would then convert into a client. I've shopped at the calexico store several times, honestly the quality of service is sort of divided... Some associates were very courteous and other's Left a lot to be desired for! But if I had to rate the overall experience my rating at this particular store would be poor!  Thanks"

1828,43567,Terri Rough,20/02/2021,Walmart,I had a delivery to day. So not happy. They left it by the road not on my porch. If I hadn't looked out my door and saw it. I wouldn't have it. So careless.
1829,43568,Chad,20/02/2021,Walmart,"I don't see why Walmart.com gets a bad rap. I've ordered lots of things (mattress included) from them and they have NEVER failed me.

1830,43569,Sade Jones,20/02/2021,Walmart,"I ordered two winter jackets for my boyfriend to wear when we go to Colorado. I made this order in January, the jackets was suppose to arrive February 4. GUESS WHAT?? Still no jackets. So I called customer service 4x and spoke with 3 agent and 1 supervisor. I was informed several times that my order was pushed through I should receive a email with a update shipping date. No email was sent no update on my shipping. So I called an request to speak with their supervisor cause at this point Iâ€™m tired of the false information. So upon me speaking to a supervisor I was told all the other agents lied to me and she was going to straighten my order out and I should receive my package by Friday 2/12 no later then 2/15. So both dates came still no order! So I checked the Walmart app only to find my order was canceled. How funny is that when a supervisor told me everything was find. So I had to reorder my jackets, I have yet to receive my money back for the 1st order! And now Iâ€™m waiting on my 2nd order. I donâ€™t use Walmart that often, and I see why?? Amazon never has these problems. I order my stuff and if there is any problems with my order they send a email right way. If the order is going to be delayed, guess what they send an email. Whatâ€™s going on Walmart???"
1831,43570,Lana Walker,20/02/2021,Walmart,"Reference#: 210204-001676  On Nov. 27, 2020, I purchased the Everyday Essentials RS 90XLS home gym from Walmart. Four boxes were delivered early December and the 5th arrived Dec. 20. We notified Walmart immediately that several pieces were missing and all boxes were returned early January. After several e-mails and phone calls, we are yet to be refunded $724.99. I've rcvd emails from Pallavi, George, Haris, Harshitha, but to date no refund. This smacks of inefficiency, incompetence and FRAUD!!!"
1832,43571,Gene Baker,20/02/2021,Walmart,We ordered new Firestone tires for my wife's 2008 Prius. We just received tiny 10 inch tires for a moving dolly or such. This is the third order in a row from Walmart online that was completely wrong. I would expect Walmart to replace the order with the correct tires but each time the send the wrong item they only offer to go through the refund process. This means we have to take the wrong item to Fed ex and start all over looking for and ordering the correct item what a colossal waste of time that Walmart throws on the customer for their lack of responsibility and accuracy. Do no out your confidence in Walmart.
1833,43572,Marisa,20/02/2021,Walmart,"I shop in Walmart stores from time to time, but it's not really my first go-to. In 2020 with plenty of extra time to do online research, I noticed Walmart had equally or more competitive online prices than Amazon, so I decided to give them a try. I have made a total of four online purchases that included in-store pick up and delivery. Overall I had a positive experience with each order. I received items in a timely manner and as described. I didn't make one single return/exchange. I can't speak to customer service because I didn't encounter any issues. I would shop online with Walmart again."
1834,43573,Roger Dodson,20/02/2021,Walmart,"Walmart's prices are decent and shipping is fast, but the prices charged by their third-party sellers are outrageous! Had a problem with one of their third-party sellers not honoring an incorrect price displayed. Went around in circles with the reseller, even after telling them I would take the matter to court. When I contacted Walmart, they were not helpful in the matter. Bought the item somewhere else. Sine then I have switched to Amazon."
1835,43574,Abdullah Fathi,20/02/2021,Walmart,Walmart.com is a joke. Like 90% of the items is for pickup or in store purchase only. I hope Amazon buries them
1836,40851,Kina,20/02/2022,Walmart,Walmart needs to have larger bags for things like paper towels and toilet paper. Years ago stores used different colors of tape that the cashier put on large items. I am tired of feeling like a criminal at the door. I will no longer shop at the super center. I will buy large items and clothes somewhere else. I havenâ€™t bought dog food from Walmart for over 2 years for this same reason. You are losing business - word of mouth is a great thing.
1837,40852,Carole Durfee,20/02/2022,Walmart,I have never had so many problems with online orders at Walmart in my life two times I ordered just recently and two times they said they had the items and then it took them hours later to find out they didnâ€™t have one and then they substituted something that I didnâ€™t even want this is getting ridiculous
1838,40853,Alfred Maraman,20/02/2022,Walmart,I hate checking out at Walmart. They have 30 cash registers and only 1 open rest self service then get checked before you leave. Makes you fell like your a thief. Do people under stand self service check out are doing away with jobs? What happen to making sure your customer has good experience in store. Much rather shop Amazon no hassle
1839,45645,Glenn,21/02/2020,Walmart,"I've been shopping Walmart for years, but I grow wearing of seeing my favorite brands being replaced with a brand called ""Great Value"". I have indeed tried this Great Value brand and found it not equal to the brand it replaced. I now make two shopping lists. One for Walmart and one for local market. the problem is I have to take one list home first and then go back to fill the other list. I suspect that I soon will have stop going to Walmart completely."

1842,40850,Eduardo Jose Torcello,21/02/2022,Walmart,"Bought a ""Herbo"" Battery and it was damaged, six months later it died, Apart from washing their hands over a compensation they didn't even ask for further information over the incident. I've done a little research and several people complain about that maker (they also say the battery lasts just 6 months). But Walmart won't take action at all and will keep on selling faulty batteries to their customers. A responsible company would inquire their customer about the facts and audit their stock to corroborate the fraud on part of their provider. They have an experience section but they won't accept a ticket that is six months old. A battery lasts at least 2 years. So how would they know if their customers are not being scammed?"
1843,45642,Patrick Osborne,22/02/2020,Walmart,"Deceptive advertising. I have a screenshot of Walmart site showing me getting a promo. A chat with Walmart support right after order confirming promo and now Walmart refusing to honor promo. The only option that isnâ€™t an option was to return phone in 3 days but the phone installment plan had already been charged and AppleCare added to phone which Walmart refused to deal with. Iâ€™m glad that this company thinks it doesnâ€™t need my business as I used to spend $100/week there and my wife spent $100/ month on online clothes for our foster baby. So Walmart has walked away from $6,000/yr to refuse a promo that they said I was getting. Iâ€™m glad that I live in an area that has competition so I have a choice to use a company that is ethical and lawful in there dealings"

After getting home i realized i had forgotten to fill the gift card, so i drove back to walmart to get it filled. As i walked in the store i had the gift card in hand and asked the self service attendee to please fill my card. She looked perterbed at me and questioned why i was bringing a gift card in the store. I playfully explained i usually grab thousands of empty gift cards and fill em later. Well apparently she wasnt pleased with my type humor. So she filled my card for ne and i told my daugbter i would pick up a couple grocery items i had forgotten. Well as i was walking through the grocery aisles the lady store manager along with 4 ither people approached me and began questioning me as to why i had brought empty gift card and told the cashier i had brought in thousands before. I explained i was being goofy. She said im not allowed to do that and that she was gonna call the police on me. She argued with me right then and there and again threatened to call the police. After great embarrassment i walked out. Harassment, walmart style."

1869,47225,Angel Is-Here,23/02/2017,Walmart,"""I have nothing but problems when I shop at Walmart.com! I have only purchased a handful of things from them and the shopping experience is far from simple and easy. First of all, I have a long-standing Walmart.com account. I also have a Walmart credit card, yet no matter what major credit card I use or even a bank debit card, my purchases are always canceled by Walmart and no reason is ever given with the notification (it's never due to insufficient funds/credit). Then I have to search & search on the site before I can locate a phone number for customer service. Then Iâ€™m always told that the reason my order was canceled is because I never used that particular card on their site before. This is crazy! I can go to any website that I have never ordered from before and never had had any orders canceled by the company. And then the only thing the rep will tell me is that they will contact their billing department and tell them to I was supposed to be able to pickup the item yesterday. I checked yesterday and my order was somewhere in Atlanta. Today it is in Tennessee! So far this is the 4th day and my order is nowhere near where I live in Florida. This is not the first time my orders have arrived several days late after the due date. I should have left Walmart.com alone after my very first order when the mini refrigerator arrived at my home with a big dent in it. I had purchased a protection plan but they wanted me to lug the fridge all the way to Walmart, and then I would have to re-order it online because they did not keep that model in stores and if I wanted the online price I would have to re-order it online all over again. They always tell me how sorry they are, but never resolve issues caused by them! Itâ€™s just one hassle after another with Walmart.com. If you shop Walmart.com you are truly taking your chances."""
1870,45641,Tammie Randolph,23/02/2020,Walmart,"Wal-Mart has gotten to big to monitor their own inventory and prices. While shopping online I found some totes the price was marked down and were available at one of my local Walmartâ€™s. When I found them in the store, I made sure the model numbers matched. When I went to purchase them the barcode would not scan at the price they were listed for online, so they would not honor them. This is false advertisement, Walmart prides themselves on price matching. Yet they did not price match their own product. Be careful when using their online feature. I myself will no longer be shopping at Walmart."
1871,36421,Sergio T.,23/02/2018,Amazon Go,This place is awesome. The future of grocery shopping! I can't wait for them to open stores here in Los Angeles!
1872,43613,Cool Kharel,23/02/2021,Walmart,"Please please please Donâ€™t buy anything online at Walmart. Walmart is worst website to go . 0 customers service. Customer have to pay for return items shipping cost , this is first time and first company said have paid for return level . Dam stop buying. Customer service told me to go return at Walmart but store donâ€™t want to return, store said 3rd party purchase and have do online. Walmart let used it website to purchase but not accepting return. 0 0 0 0 0"
1873,40846,Sam Dearing,23/02/2022,Walmart,The employees are worthless and refuse to help or even stop their conversations. Their online pick up is a joke - you have to go to an unmarked place and call a number which no one answers and it sends you to voicemail. I would rather pay amazon more money than deal with the morons at walmart
1874,40847,Jaime Mendoza,23/02/2022,Walmart,I am so happy with my service I was provided yesterday from Daisy in the auto service area. Daisy was slammed from customer after customer and when it was my husbands and my turn she greeted us with a smile and was so very helpful when it can to my tires that were worn down. She had to special order these tires because they were not at the store. When they came in my husband and I showed up and Daisy and her team serviced my vehicle right away. I honestly couldnâ€™t have been more happy with the professionalism and how polite Daisy and her team were and are. Thank you so much Daisy and team fro all you did for my husband and I yesterday!  Aurora Walmart off chambers and Parker road.
1875,40848,DJ,23/02/2022,Walmart,"Order online today (2/22/22) and was told that my package was to be shipped by Wed 2/23/22 through Friday 2/24/22. This evening I get an email stating that my packages were delivered to my front door with a photo of a house. Well it was not my house and I have no idea whose it may be. I called Walmart and was told that once it leaves the store via Door Dash there was nothing, they could do about it. I had no idea it was to be shipped via Door dash assumed it was to be shipped via UPS or Fedex. I had to call corporate and get an entire refund. Now I have to watch my credit card to make sure it was cancelled. What a waste of time."

1900,45636,Paula Queen,24/02/2020,Walmart,"today's experience was the worst by far, 5th time in 2 weeks we came in to purchase Great value 150 ct Styrofoam plate still NOT STOCKED, 2nd complaint, my husband waited at the cashier in sports register where you purchase fishing license ask 4 GSR's for assistance again no help, 3rd complaint we were purchasing a microwave needed help getting off shelf and into cart, me and my husband are disabled seniors with mobility issues, still got no assistance for any GSR that were just standing around cover-sating among themselves, was so upset I called and spoke the store manager by the name of Andy, who i go the interpretation he'd care less about my issues, I WILL THINK TWICE ABOUT DOING BUSINESS WITH THIS WALMART AGAIN, CALLED AND COMPLAINED TO CORPORATE OFFICE AND THE NICE YOUNG LADY Madison, took my complaint and advised me it take up to 3 day to get a response to the action"
1901,45637,Sunny,24/02/2020,Walmart,"My husband is ninety years old and I am eighty. We do have health problems.Last Friday a door greeter stopped us at Walmart and demanded our receipt.I gave it to her.She moved our bags and looked inside .I should never have done that.it took her a long time to finish, and I was standing there waiting until she finished, and my back was killing me. I felt like a criminal. I felt harrassed and insulted. What a disgrace I will never put another foot in that Walmart at Front Royal Virginia"
1902,45638,Emily Possemato,24/02/2020,Walmart,"I have had several issues ordering things through walmart.com where any time I needed customer service to get involved it was an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE. If one more associate said ""i am sorry for the wrong information the previous associate gave you""...NO YOURE NOT. That is not an excuse for poor customer service and if I get a different story every time I call...its YOU not ME.  I have never worked with a company that simply doesn't care about their customers whatsoever. Even Amazon's customer service is better. No longer ordering anything from walmart.com EVER AGAIN."
1903,45639,Deborah Smith,24/02/2020,Walmart,"I ordered several clothing items from Walmart.com and although a few were okay, the majority of the items were not, so I returned them. It has been over a week and I still have not received the credits to the credit card used to make the purchase. I contacted walmart.com and was told they would contact me in 48 hours. When I use Amazon.com, they credit very quickly as soon as I return an item. I am not happy with walmart.com's return process, so may not order from them again."
1904,45640,Michael Williams,24/02/2020,Walmart,"Ordered a $549 laptop from Walmart.com and received a ($10?) quilt pattern. No joke. I contacted Walmart.com and I was told my CU would be here in the next two days just go to my email they sent,print off the return label, and send it back via fedex. After CU DID NOT show up I called them back AGAIN to be told they cannot sent my item until they get thereâ€™s back which I was gonna trade the fedex driver. Theyâ€™re policy is regardless dollar value they cannot ship the item they were SUPPOSED to send until they get the wrong item back. I also added the protection plan which started when I ordered the CU, not received it. It was due to me six days ago and still waiting.... never again will I use their site"
1905,45648,Ani,24/02/2020,Walmart,"Worst place ever, went with mom and in one aisle there was a customer having a seizure on floor. Everyone walked past her while we rushed to her. I told an employee what was happening and to quickly call for help while we make sure she wouldnt choke or bite her tongue while seizing. The 2 employees followed me into the aisle and just stared down at the woman. So I repeated again ""call 911"". Girl pulls out walkie talkie telling someone to check camera for that aisle. Instead of doing the one thing I asked which was the whole reason I went to grab the two employees. When the woman started coming back she was at first, of course, confused but it was when she started realizing where she was that the one female employee said loudly. ""Did she pee herself?"". The poor lady just hearing this and realizing shes in the middle of Walmart started panicking and was humiliated and embarrassed. They acted unprofessional and instead of helping looked down on her with judgemental stares. The employees are stupid they never called for help and didnt follow the lady when she was trying to leave. Mom and I tried to stop her but she wouldnt listen and we couldnt really force her to stay but the employees stood there judging the girl cause she peed herself why seizing. Which is why she left. They didnt even tell her to stay down in case she concussed herself. They cared too much about the fact she peed and watched her like she was a damn freak show.  Walmart employees are the worst and the store overall is absolute crap.  I give it zero stars."
1906,40843,Cathy Adams,24/02/2022,Walmart,"This review is about Walmart Supercenter on Lockwood Rd in Sarasota. This store is terrible to shop at. For the last year they have out of so many of the regular items. From groceries, housewares and paint is a joke. ""I recently went to a Walmart store in Lakewood Ranch. That store is fully stocked. Therefore, I think the Sarasota store needs better management. Please review this store, it needs help."

1908,40845,Rob Brink,24/02/2022,Walmart,"I was at Walmart in St. Cloud MN today. I found two items I was buying the rang up more than what the pricing on the shelf said. After checking out I needed to go to the customer service area and get my refund. It wasn't that much but I felt bad because the woman at the counter was arguing with me even after I showed her the pictures of the product on the shelf. No apology, and I am the jerk."
1909,45631,Delores hoffert,25/02/2020,Walmart,"I bought a roko tv on Black Friday , I didnâ€™t open it right away , my husband has serious health problems , we had to wait until some could help us put it up !!

I got 5 different answers from 5 different people , tried another store , called first the manger said no problem bring the receipt, if itâ€™s under 90 days we will exchange it !! Drove 120 miles and they would not take it back !! Talk to another higher up manger and his reply was u have until Christmas Eve to return Black Friday purchases !! I asked how as a customer am I suppose to know the rules ?? Everyone I talk to has a different story !! I believe they make them up as they go !! I didnâ€™t do anything wrong and ended up losing my money !! Buyer beware when u shop at Walmart !! U might be donating your money to a multimillion company !!"

1912,36263,Ana G.,25/02/2018,Amazon Go,"New and weird experience. It definitely feels like the ""wave of the future"" at least for convenience-style stores. I think there is more need of employees in large stores.  You download the ""Amazon Go"" app which you scan at the entrance (like the airport) and the gates open. Reminded me of a train turnstyle (like the Tube)  What I read on the app was that anything you pick up goes on your bill, and if you set it down its taken off of your bill. I didn't want to be mistakenly charged--so I was too afraid to pick anything up! Normally, I would've picked up some of the packaged sandwiches, etc, to look at the ingredients. The tags showing the price I felt were a little small, so I really had to look at them.  They did have staff at the door giving directions, re-stocking shelves, and carding people in the back by the alcohol. I picked up my chosen item, and exited the store, and received an email showing me my bill! In general, if I went in there often, and knew what they carried, it would be super useful. I'd love to see them everywhere."
1913,36380,Vivian W.,25/02/2018,Amazon Go,"Fun adventure! My parents are visiting in town and since Amazon Go is on the news all around the world, they were eager to go check it out. We came at around 7pm on a Friday night. No line at all. Staffs were giving out free reusable shopping bags at door which was nice. My parents are visiting and don't have amazon go app not Amazon go accounts so I was a bit worried they'd be denied entry without the app. Thankfully, I was told I can scan them in with my app, and each person can scan 20 people in. The store is fairy small, a lot smaller than I expected. But for this to be the first ""grab and go experiment"" store, I  understand the need to keep it simple. I would say a large percentage of the store is dedicated to grab and go lunch. They have a bunch of sandwiches, bagels, pre-packed salads, small meals, wraps, burritos. An entire shelf of them right when you walk in. Most of them are made by quite famous bakerys. We grabbed a few items to test it out. It definitely did not show up on my cart in my app right when I grab it (as I saw on the commercial). Rather, it gave me a receipt of everything I walked out of the store with me about 5 minutes after I left the store. We also tried to have my m carry 2 items and I carried 2 items out and they did all counted in my receipt since I scanned her in. What really amazes me is how they keep track of whom I scan in and count their purchase toward me without any tags or anything at all!! I even asked the staff, we don't have to leave at the same time for it to work! Mind blowing technology!! I can't begin to imagine the world we will be living in 10 years from now.. Overall, store doesn't have much to shop unless you're in need of a quick bite to eat,  for but fun experience!"
1914,36435,Mary P.,25/02/2018,Amazon Go,"So cool and a Must-Experience while in downtown Seattle. As I anxiously planned my trip to Amazon Go, I did some research and made sure to have the app readily installed and good to go. I was also able to view the items that this trendy on the go shop had so that I was even more prepared. I have to admit that I didn't think the shop would be as small as it is but it's space is efficient in that it carries the right amount of stuff so that people can shop here with purpose and not spend a whole of of time pondering over what to get. I did, however. :) I had to! I didn't know when the next time would be for me to be able to indulge in this cool shopping experience. My guess is that the average time spent is about 5-7 minutes per person. Upon entry you may pick up a cool bright orange reusable bag for your shopping convenience. I like that there are a lot of items from local purveyors, from Blazing Bagels and Alki Bakery to Seattle Chocolates and hey, I moonstruck - love, love, LOVE them chocolates. It's easy to go overboard here. I just piled everything into my bright orange Amazon Go bag and walked out without knowing the exact damage to my vacay budget...like I had a sugar daddy that would be picking up the bill. Man, oh man, it's a good thing these places aren't in every corner like Starbucks. My wallet can't take another addiction like that.  Late post for experience on 02.08.18"
1915,36460,Warren T.,25/02/2018,Amazon Go,In and out without a line.  Just wish the selection was larger. This would be perfect if Whole Foods used just walk out technology.
1916,36162,MissL219,25/02/2019,Amazon Go,Its the future! We had heard that this was the first Amazon Go so we had to give it a try. You need to have the app already downloaded as this is what you use to open the barriers to get into the store. Once your inside you can pick your groceries and then walk out when you've finished shopping. Payment for your items is charged to the app. We went a couple of times as we stayed not far away. It was really strange the first time as it just felt so strange to literally pick items and then leave the store. I got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich there and it was fantastic. One of my favourite foods of our trip.
1917,43563,Marie Leibas,25/02/2021,Walmart,"SO ANGRY, I would like to know WHY it is necessary to lock up a $6. Facial Hair Remover item?? Had to wait 7 min. for staff to unlock the glass door. Then that staff had to take it to register 9 where I was allowed to pick it up when I checked out. Register 9 was full of people w/ large orders. My clerk had to walk over to #9 and get my remover. Really stupid."
1918,43564,Tom Jones,25/02/2021,Walmart,Walmart delivery. The date they say your going to receive the merchandise and the date you actually receive it differs greatly. Can not rely on the delivery date they give you so if you are depending on the date they give you when you place the order you better not have a trip planned.

1922,45627,Julia RO,26/02/2020,Walmart,Walmart should claim their business on Trustpilot. I do not like being stopped by the greeter on the way out with my purchase to see if I've paid for my cart full of paid bagged merchandise. It's very insulting and insinuates that I'm a thief. Too bad people that steal give the rest of us a bad name. Target does not treat me like a shoplifter.
1923,45628,Terra O'Zoe Griffith,26/02/2020,Walmart,"Horrible, zero response in any way!  Copy of correspondence to Walmart:   I am awaiting your response as regards this transaction before pursuing any other recourse.  You should also be aware that on the day I purchased the printer online, that your website indicated that there were four in stock at our local Walmart, yet when my husband went to buy one immediately,  there were none in stock at the store and when he spoke with the store employees,  they indicated that they had not had any.  My husband called and informed me of this, at which time I put the order in online.    In reflecting on what I now know, I feel this could possibly fall under the category of false advertising (not actually having said item), bait-and-switch (we can sell you this other item) and out and out theft (you took money for an item and, though you continue to advertise that item on your web site, you have not produced the item you sold me).  I am hoping that you will correct this impression,  otherwise, I feel a complaint, at the minimum, to the Better Business Bureau would be  Date: 2/25/20 8:56 AM (GMT-05:00)  To: Doug Mcmillon CEO Janey Whiteside Customer Service VP John Furner President  Subject: Customer Service at its finest?   Order Number: 3212075-418501  Tracking Number:  144040595801   On February 21st I purchased a laser printer from Walmart online.  I received confirmation of the purchase and the shipping information which stated the printer had been shipped and would arrive on Friday, February 23rd.  The amount paid for the printer was subtracted from my bank account that day.  A copy of the confirmation is shown at the bottom of this email.   The printer did not arrive on Friday as stated.  When by Monday evening, February 26th, the printer had still not arrived, I followed up on Walmart's tracking, which stated it had shipped, and FedEx tracking, which stated they had not received the shipment.   I called Walmart Customer Service, that is an hour of my life I will never recover, and was told that the printer was never shipped, that the item was now ""out of stock"" but it is in stock at the price of $249.95.  After speaking to several supervisors and then being transferred to Customer Resolutions, the only resolution being offered was to refund my purchase price so I could now purchase the exact same printer for $150 more.   I am simply requesting that Walmart honor my purchase and ship the printer to me as soon as possible.  I look forward to hearing from you with a positive resolution.

She was slamming my items down when i got home i got to unpacking my groceries my 3 loaves of bread were squished , i had a few cracked eggs . While still checking out i noticed a hole in the dog food she snapped and pointed to my daughter to go get one . I thought thats what they had runners for .

I am retired and living on Social security which is not nearly enough! I needed some things delivered well Mondays promised delivery time came and went and a couple of hours went by and I received a call from the Driver who told me that my order was delayed but the computer was down but I should still receive it well a few hours later I called her back and she said that all morning deliveries were being cancelled still no notifications from Walmart themselves but I wasn't too concerned I had enough money on hand to take care of reordering. I chose to go ahead and reorder which was a mistake the computer deleted just enough from my order to disguise the delivery fee which I as a Walmart+ member should not have to pay so I went ahead and placed my order and it was Delivered a few minutes late on Tuesday well I immediately noticed my Items were missing so I looked at my bill which showed those Items weren't on the bill and I called Walmart and asked for a refund of my delivery charge(Big Mistake) instead of processing the refund of my delivery Fee the accounts department charged everything but the delivery charge again and didn't cancel the original charge well my checking account was now in the red only $0.97 but I was now Owed double the amount of money From Walmart and I call again well I tried to explain the problem but nobody took it seriously and it was Not bad trying to get that money back it only took till Saturday although I am a little miffed with my bank since they are no longer showing the bad transactions which Walmart made to bounce my account fortunately I have bounce protection but what business does Walmart have double charging anyone for an order because they asked for a delivery fee return? Thursday I got my $4.95Then on Saturday I get the money back that they erroneously held on my account Since Wednesday Yeah but it is now 4 Days into the recovery from the computer glitch my Order From Sunday is still not cancelled for it is still listed as preparing in the App, on my phone and I call again this Time I am trying very hard to hold my temper but I did get to talk to a supervisor and I got an email stating that my refund would be in my account in 1 to 2 business days I had not noticed this promise but I was relieved that some progress or so I thought was happening Every day one of the 1st things I do is check my checking account to see if my money has been returned and every day I have been disappointed. Today February 24th I get out my E-mail to find my order number and I noticed the words that I had missed before 1 to 2 billing cycles well that means 1 to 2 business days it has been 4 billing cycles I call and once again I talk to another mealy mouthed individual and I am once again put off with the explanation that they are having a hard time getting the refunds processed and that he has escalated this issue I await my refund with baited breath but I will not hold my breath Sunday it will have been 2 weeks since they took my money and I am extremely tired of the BS I have put up with from the customer service people.

But I don't know her personally.but I also worked at Sam's Club but they closed down and she see a guy I use to work with brother. I only go in there with my debt card. And my list.. It makes me really uncomfortable with her watching me ..so I started to go to wagmens and tops and hardware and mall stores...i use to buy on line but I had to go to the store to pick items up.. So I go through Amazon now...sorry but I have worked in retail over 30 years 15 as a manager and never felt the way I do when I go into that walmart we even go to 2 other Wal-Mart's when we drive 50 min away to go to a local Sam's Club ...or 30 to another one.

Next day got â€œSorry, the item was not priced correctly.â€ It doubled from the $280 as advertised. Waited several days for the money to be put back into my account.  I have made a BBB complaint. Still waiting a week later.  Update: Was contacted by Walmart. They could only offer a compromise that increased my cost to an acceptable level. While I could not purchase the original item that allowed different degrees of adjustment, they did offer a similar item that had set adjustment levels. I have ordered and if not satisfied, will return as it is not the item initially desired."

This walmart used to be a friendly well stocked store."
1934,45625,TONYA,27/02/2020,Walmart,Stood in line for almost 30 minutes with 4 other women and a small child. Did it ever occur to anyone to stop for a few minutes and then resume after we used the facilities? I typed this review while still waiting for the man to be done. I finally walked to where he had his cleaning and I found him using the bathroom instead of using the men's. Even though he knew he had a line of women waiting. It is the opinion of me and at least 2 of the other ladies that he did this intentionally. Extremely unacceptable. Just one more reason I am growing to hate shopping at Walmart.
1935,45626,Kamini Jaswal,27/02/2020,Walmart,"Worst site for online shopping and placing an order. I placed an order with 3 items and I received only one out of them and for 2nd, even without raising a return request, I got refund instead of that item and its been whole month that i still have no clue about third item. I have called several times to Walmart as well as shipping partner but every time i am being fooled. This was my first and definitely last order from Walmart. I will never recommend it for online shopping to anybody. This is the worst experience with walmart as it was a sheer wastage of money, time and patience."

The ad stated it was in stock for in-store pickup only. I was told by the Electronics Supervisor and the Customer Service Supervisor that there was a website glitch and there was nothing they could do. I even called headquarters and filed a complaint, but have not had a response from anyone. While I assumed the price was too good to be true, I never thought for a moment that Walmart would just leave me hanging. Beware of their website ads that lure you into the store where most of us already spend the majority of our paychecks."

1941,40841,Miss Nikki,27/02/2022,Walmart,"Good prices, they have everything you may need all at one store."
1942,46842,Deb A.,28/02/2019,Walmart,"Most cashiers are okay in general, but many are straight up rude. I have been in more of Walmart stores than I care to admit. Sometimes they are the only game in town. Quality, choice and service poor at best. The lack of English language is horrible."

1944,45620,Adam Goldin,28/02/2020,Walmart,"I ordered something, a TV that i wanted fast so i picked out one that i could have in 2 days. I have a picture with my confirmation number. The TV never showed up and they cant find it in the system. All they offer is to excalate the problem and have someone get back to me and then noone calls!! Won't get me to a manger!! It means you would need to call and verify via phone every order you submit online!! I never review companies but this is insane!! I now got to a manager and was told that they could do nothing for me, either expediting or reatking order. GAIL simply told me to reorder and check with my credit card company to start a didspute over any charges!!"
1945,45621,Mukhtar Mohamad,28/02/2020,Walmart,The things on the website aren't in the store so its kind of confusing.
1946,45622,Tammie Wooten Camden,28/02/2020,Walmart,1 star because I can not give zero. I ordered a computer that showed in stock last night. Tonight I get an email saying it will be delayed delivery for an indefinite timeframe. Ask about just changing the color I am informed that they can not do that but they can cancel my order and I can just reorder it and my money will ge returns no later t bf an march 9th. Now I do not understand that time line but their explanation is 48 hrs for the cancellation to take place than after that is processed it will take another 3-5 days for them to initiate the return then that could take another 3-5 days that will be up to my bank. No other compensation offered only a generic apology sorry for the inconvenience of us not having the product you ordered and a price match guarantee if the price goes up before we finally return your money that we took in 5 min but will only give bank in almost 2 weeks. Very disappointed upset customer.
1947,45623,Jason Rezabala,28/02/2020,Walmart,"I loved Walmart at one point! I used to shop at Secaucus m, they were always out of stock on most of my shopping needs always crowded, no one that works there speaks English! Hate that place! Then I was happy when the one on north Bergen opened! After a couple years, itâ€™s now going in the same direction as Secaucus!!! Shelves always empty no one speaks English! Itâ€™s so horrible now!!! LEARN HOW TO KEEP SHELVES FULL,if itâ€™s always selling out keep it back stocked so u donâ€™t run out!! I get it, sometimes things are out of stock but come on!! I stopped my delivery service cuz there was issues with delivery, can never get next day service, and always out of STOCK!! so I have to go out elsewhere to shop anyway, do I canceled it!!! Iâ€™ma manager in a supermarket and every time I see the empty shelves it makes me want to get a job there to help them out!!! Who ever does the ordering they suck! U guys make great money, but could definitely be much more if u know how to keep shelves full!!!!"
1948,36242,Alexa T.,28/02/2018,Amazon Go,"So hyped to come here, but then confused once we were done...because it was just so fast. It kind of feels like you're stealing because it's so odd to just walk out! Here's how it works:  1. Download Amazon Go app 2. Scan app to enter store 3. Put whatever you want to purchase in your bag 4. Head out, then within minutes you'll receive you're itemized receipt  I probably wouldn't do all my groceries here, but they have a lot of meal ready options, and part of the building includes microwaves and an eating area so you can have a quick meal or snack right after. There's also beer, wine and an employee to check your ID and assist you. The ceiling is covered with cameras that pretty much scans and watches you. You can come with a friend, but how the store works to confirm that person is part of your purchase and leaving at separate times is over my head. I don't know specifics, but it works, and it's really cool! Technology is crazy."
1949,43550,Kristy Dyer,28/02/2021,Walmart,I purchased a 3x5 rug for 35.97. when I checked my receipt they charged me for a 4x6 rug which was 54.97. I told the store and was told the tag was wrong and it was my problem and they don't even sell 4x6 rugs. I called corporate and they said we will document what happened.
1950,43551,Randy Ashley,28/02/2021,Walmart,Store in Richland MS is the worst in all aspects. Rudest employees always under stocked and they guard the front door like a prison and don't try to call them to complain. I held on for 15 minutes and was cut off. (typical). There online service with FED-EX is a joke. Will never set foot in another Walmart.
1951,43552,paulo jorge anselmo,28/02/2021,Walmart,"Placed grocery order at 12:14pm, even paid the $10 up charge for delivery within 2 hours...and here it is, 10:41pm and my groceries still havenâ€™t been delivered. Two chats with Walmartâ€™s customer service didnâ€™t move things along. They only able to tell me that (1) the store isnâ€™t responding to them, and (2) they see that a driver canceled at 1:00pm....and they want me to believe that for 7, 8, 9 hours after that the store couldnâ€™t find a driver to make the 1.2 mile delivery. Incompetent clowns!"
1952,43553,Mykiell Beard,28/02/2021,Walmart,Worst customer service ever if you are buying a item and have a problem and i have the past 2 items that dont claim responsibility and you are orherwise screwed with your purches and they wont make it right stick to amazon
1953,40840,Alexandro Montijo,28/02/2022,Walmart,no explanation No help Employees escalated situation Employee said the customer was wrong
1954,45614,James Catlett,29/02/2020,Walmart,Ordered many times from Walmart website and shipping is never in timeframe promised. Most recent was last Wednesday and I made sure everything I ordered was next day delivery eligible. Placed the order and next day the order is updated to a Saturday delivery. Hardly next day. Today is Saturday and after tracking the order for the past couple days it finally moved from processing to shipped. Thatâ€™s right. The order just ships the date of delivery 3 days after placing an order for next day delivery. Some law firm needs to get something going with a class action lawsuit and finally hold Walmart accountable for their breach of contracts and false advertisement. I hate when corporate giants like this just donâ€™t care about their customers because they are so big and gross revenue is so large they find it insignificant when customers wise up and finally stop shopping with them. Maybe if enough people started dropping them and shopping amazon or target then they might get their heads out of their asses and stop believing they are above consumer laws. I myself am fed up and will take my business elsewhere.
1955,45615,Lea,29/02/2020,Walmart,"Last 2 times I ordered online will be my absolute LAST time. Their shipping is awful and to make it worse, there is no accountability. Walmart you lost an online shoppers to Amazon. Their shipments have never been late, Walmart may want to find out what they're doing right."

1957,45617,Guy Noble,29/02/2020,Walmart,"To make a long story short, I think you guys should send in someone from home office into this store in Hollywood #3163. I shop there 4 times per week and I always witnessed verbal abuse and job threatening to the associates from a co manager named Jackie. I even addressed him regarding the way he threatened a young lady and he told me to mind my f word business or shop elsewhere. I even reported this to store manager Alan and he told me thatâ€™s not his problem. I think co manager Jackie should be under close watch!"
1958,45618,Sharon Jones,29/02/2020,Walmart,"I used the order pick-up... figured Walmart was competing with Amazon. It worked great. Picked up my product by scanning the bar code from the email and received it right in the chute near checkout around midnight - NOTHING BETTER, OR MORE CONVENIENT working 2nd shift... Reordered the product and found out they've got a NEW RULE: pick up only between 8am and 8pm now. Working 2nd shift this defeated the whole purpose for me - especially at 24 hr store. Went in next 2 days on my lunch break at 7pm, line of people waiting at the chute for packages. About 6 people 'checked in' status, with 1 'retrieving' status on the leader board. Most had been waiting at LEAST 15 MINUTES!! THIS SUCKS. ANOTHER LINE AT WALMART. You might as well run advertisements for AMAZON if you're not going to staff this feature. Stop biting off more than you can chew. STICK TO WHAT YOU DO. Enough problems in your core business to tweak without trying to compete with Amazon. You want to be the be-all, do-all store, and you're just herding people from one lined up mess to the next. NO MORE WALMART PICK UP ORDERS FOR ME."
1959,45619,Ashley,29/02/2020,Walmart,"I tried the grocery delivery for the 2nd time as my first experience went really well. However, this time was not the same. I received items that were already opened. I also did not receive a reimbursement for the items that I did not receive. When I used the customer service chat the customer service representative stated that I was never charged for the items. I informed the representative that Walmart charged me before I received the money. She then informs me that I have to wait for my bank to issue the funds to my account. However, they did not refund the money after a week. I then had to have someone call to work on the same problem again. I will no longer use this service nor waste my time with Walmart anymore after this incident. As I don't understand how and why they are selling opened food items. This company is a scam!!"

1961,45557,David Klotter,13/03/2020,Walmart,"Like most people being on a budget and being busy all the time ... I look for the best deals least amount of travel or shopping time I will normally spend on average 30$ -75 $ every 3-5 days .. thatâ€™s a lot of money I put into this company . When I have a return I have to wait till I have a few returns and try to do them all at once .. reason is walkmart only allows you to return items with out a receipt over $25 or totaling over $25 ( 3 ) times a year!!!! This is ridiculous ! I spend so much money there and will only takke the store credit ( which is all I ask for I lost my receipt so thereâ€™s an expected penalty) but to only allow 3no receipt returns a year ... thatâ€™s just wrong! I feel that I am retuning an item, especially if itâ€™s a great value product .. or items .. then I should be given a store credit as many times as I bring my items in m... not being greedy because Iâ€™m just going to come back at ankther time to purchase other items I need .. using said store credit! The customer service people and managers are so conditioned by the company that they feel if they were to question ir challenge the rule they will be fired... thereâ€™s something wrong with this picture! Cooperate Walmart stop being greedy and contribute to kindness and fairness!!"
1962,45558,Shirley Thompson,13/03/2020,Walmart,The pickup groceries is horrible. I waited over an hour. The 2 employees working refused to tell anyone anything.
1963,45559,Beth Anne Goodsell,13/03/2020,Walmart,"I ordered grocery delivery and they brought expired milk, The delivery cost $9.95. I let them know and they said they would only refund the money for the milk only - not delivery - if I brought the milk back to the store. I ordered delivery because I cannot walk or drive now. I usually use instacart and I will only be using them in the future."
1964,45560,Sarah Lee,13/03/2020,Walmart,I purchased an iPhone 6s. Exactly three weeks later the phone got hot and died. It would not come back on. I had taken the phone to an Apple store and was told it was defective. Walmart would not exchange phones. I have the receipt and package it came in. No one could help me. I guess I just donated money to Walmart.
1965,45561,Edie Thatch,13/03/2020,Walmart,"I have been going to Wal Mart in Port St. Lucie for 17 years and was treated horribly by Employee Christina today when she followed me to the other side of the store to pick a fight with me by calling me a ""Puta."" I objected to their employees having access to much needed paper products in the back of the store and hoarding it for themselves. While we waited for 20 minutes for them to bring more paper towels napkins and of course toilet paper, they held it in back while their employees got 24 packs for themselves while keeping it from paying customers. When I went to the other side of the store to get away from this obviously angry employee, she followed me, called me names in Spanish and used intimidating tactics to try and scare me. All while waiting for me to give up on waiting for what I needed and called me stupid because I didn't get it sooner. This employee needs to be fired! The manager is so scared of her she would not confront her even after Christina threatened to have me removed from the store for complaining. Other employees are well aware that she is a difficult employee because they were ""not surprised"" when I informed management of her name calling and stalking. If Wal Mart employees need items they should have to shop and wait for them like the rest of us, instead they hoard it all for themselves leaving none for us, shameful!"
1966,45562,Unsatisfied Customer,13/03/2020,Walmart,"I placed an order for a gift card using one of my credit cards they took the money then refunded and sent me an email saying my order was canceled because they could not verify my payment, the next day I did the same but with a different credit card, same thing happened they took the money then refunded it sending me another email saying the same thing. so why can I use them in the store but not online, also if the cards where no good how did they draw and return the money. I feel discriminated. GOODBYE WALMART.COM I WILL NOT SHOP ON YOUR BS WEBSITE"
1967,45563,Jeannie,13/03/2020,Walmart,"Like millions of others, I do most of my grocery shopping at Walmart. I'm rethinking where I do my spending. Today, just found toilet paper 12 roll pak $12.24!! SHAME on Walmart! Taking advantage of public in wake of coronavirus panic!! There r many other grocery stores I will be spending my money. Sam Walton would not approve of how his stores r run today!"

1969,45565,Zaki Dahdah,13/03/2020,Walmart,"Walmart with all the money they make from the daily customers are too poor to provide disinfectant stations at their stores, I only noticed one store that had a couple of spray bottles in Ottawa, poor attitude to say the least"
1970,36333,Jessica B.,13/03/2018,Amazon Go,"We were in the area and had to check this out to see just how it worked.  And now I have to look it up, because I still don't know.  Prior to visiting, I downloaded the Amazon Go App and linked it to my Amazon Prime account.  My husband and I both went in, but I was the only one with the app, so when we got there, I scanned my phone, let him in, and then scanned it again and went in myself.  There were employees there to help if help was needed  - though it doesn't seem like they actually offer help unless asked (as there were 5 people confused and blocking our entry into the store and not 1 of the 3 employees standing there chatting offered to help them). So as long as you know what to do when you get there, you are good to shop.  We picked up a sandwich and some fruit for lunch and placed it in our (free for now) Amazon reusable shopping bag.  We walked out, picked up some napkins, sriracha, and mayo packets and went on our way.  A little while later I received an email receipt for our purchases at the store.  Easy peasy."
1971,36256,Vivian L.,13/03/2019,Amazon Go,"Pros :  + Convenient + Doesn't double charge if you bring products from outside in + Healthy choices Meal Kits (food delivery without the delivery)  Cons :  - Doesn't seem very sustainable (environmentally). Each item is individually wrapped with lots of plastic wastes (worse than Trader Joe's). - Everything cold = the inconvenience of reheating - No hot plate option. ONLY quick grab and go.  I would LOVE to see ONE DAY SOON :  The ability to preorder online (via app) exactly what I want cooked from their kitchen for pick up, (using my own list of requested ingredients). I live 2 blocks away while my husband works nearby. Yo Amazon, can you make this!"
1972,43518,Judith,13/03/2021,Walmart,"I have been using home delivery since I hurt my back in October. Today's experience has me more than upset. I got a notice that my order had been delivered. Checked everywhere and did not see it anywhere. I called customer service and spoke to a very nice lady who helped me to place another order. The replacement order finally arrived at 6 PM. Guess what, it was still missing my ice cream and candy. I give up!! Not sure I will place anymore orders through this service."
1973,43519,Christym Bullb,13/03/2021,Walmart,"I placed an order on 3/9...then I realized I ordered wrong size and canceled immediately after the order on 3/9. Walmart customer service kept saying the order was pending cancelation and I would receive the email to confirm in 48 hours. 4 days later, after many conversations with customer service assuring it wouldn't be shipped, it was shipped. Now I have to go through the hassel of returning it when it should have been canceled like they said. They just tell you anything to get you off the phone."
1974,43520,Justin Cantrell,13/03/2021,Walmart,"Customer support is a joke. They are rude, I was lied to and after two days talking to several reps, I still never got my problem solved. Save yourself the hassle and order from anywhere but Walmart.com"
1975,40804,Deborah Aguirre,13/03/2022,Walmart,"I like many of the products but am very disappointed in the store. Mobility scooters for disabled are rarely available. No bagging clerks, slow cashiers, carts for stocking often block aisles, and too many things are locked up (men's underwear???). Will order online but will not shop in the store anymore (have shopped there for over 10 years)."

Since my last visit, the check out has been updated. I like the flow better for self check out. Self check out used to be a bottle neck. Items were out. I surprising only spent a little over $10 for my food items. I thought what I was seeking would be more."
1977,47120,Beautiful Butterfly,14/03/2018,Walmart,"Last Saturday around 6:30pm I went into Walmart to look for a flat screen tv, I saw the tv that I wanted but it was up on a high shelf & I couldn't reach it. I went up to an employee, the employee was helping another customer so I waited until he was done. When he was done I said ""Excuse me? Can you help me with something?"" He looked at me and then walked right passed me to help another customer. I then asked a woman who directed me to a sales clerk I asked the sales clerk ""There's a 40 inch flat screen tv that I want but I can't reach it will you help me?"" He looked at me & said ""We don't sell 40 inch tvs we only sell 55 inch tvs."" I told him that I saw several 40 inch tvs sitting on the shelf, he then turned his back and continued to work. When I walked away I saw the first employee that I asked for help he walk past me & didn't say a word. I ended up buying a tv but it wasn't the kind that I wanted. The way I was treated was unfair and cruel, no employee should have the right to treat customer like that."
1978,45547,Laura Melani,14/03/2020,Walmart,"If there was -10000 rating option, I would have chosen it! This documentary: 'UDITA' (Arise) [Documentary about female garment workers, Bangladesh] on YouTube from Rainbow Collective - Documentary Production is one of the worst thing I have ever seen: these poor workers from Bangladesh (as from many other poor countries) are struggling to live and get a minimum wage. Some of them also lost their lives working in factories with terrible working conditions! Walmart (Freestyle) is one of the brands (also Primark, Waikiki) named on the tags of the clothing showed in this doc. Just terrifying... These brands are just interested in making profits with NO RESPECT FOR LIFE. Hopefully, I have never bought anything from this clothing brands. If brands have no respect for human rights, then consumers should react by NOT buying anything from them & protesting. How could you, dear consumer, think of buying things for $5? Who pays all the workers of the whole supply chain? Awful quality and low price means EXPLOITATION OF HUMAN LIVES. Snap out of it!"
1979,45548,Red RamRoyal,14/03/2020,Walmart,With the Corona Virus in full swing and unable to get the necessities needed for my family I showed up at my local store in Greeley Colorado at 5am. 1 hour before the store opens up. At 5:10 I was in line waiting for the opening when one of the employees walked out the side door with a shopping cart full of paper towels and toilet paper. This was long before the store opened up. I was the first one in the door and the first one to the empty toilet paper isle. Apparently Walmart condones this as I reported it. I was asked for proof and told them that they could verify the time stamp on their video system as well as the vehicle license plate number and make/model that I gave them. walmart doesnâ€™t care

After finally finding a phone # and waiting for around 30 minutes(Walmart.com) on hold they told me to file a police report and basically accused me of lying ??? Are you kidding me ? Iâ€™m going through my credit card company ! NEVER buy anything from Walmart.com, they donâ€™t deliver the product ( stolen)then basically call the customer the liar. As they steal your money . So very wrong !!! BAD Bad Company Walmart!!!"

There were no instructions for returning the product and it took a very long time on the phone with customer service to reach an unsatisfactory resolution. I certainly will not be doing any on-line business with Walmart in the future.

Eight days (6 of which were business days) later still waiting for my money back. No big deal but Amazon would have had it back the same day.

This pickup service COULD BE a great thing if only they could get organized!!!!!! People were waiting over one hour in their cars. I got home and two items were missing. Drove back and difficult to get help. They said when they can't get something, they send you an email. I said, ""How about you TELL ME when you give me my groceries?! Or ""How about you hand me a pink slip and let me know I did not get an item, but I did not pay for it either!"""
1988,43516,C Daks,14/03/2021,Walmart,"The employees at the Walmart Store located at 41200 Murrieta Springs Rd, Murrieta, CA 92562 are not treating their customers FIRST and don't treat ASIANS well.  I went to this store this morning (March 24,m2021) around 8:00 to 8:30 and looking to buy a ROKU. The store was not busy. I found the ROKU ,but it was locked inside the cabinet. So, I looked around for help. There was nobody at the Entertainment Center. I was looking for a buzzer, a bell or a phone to call but none exist. Finally, there was an employee passed by and mentioned that I want to buy a. ROKU. She looked around and found the guy assigned to work at the Entertainment Center and she told me that he is coming. Few minutes later, I the guy come and told him that I want to by a ROKU. Then. another employee (a woman) came and talked to the guy. The guy opened one of the locked cabinets for her and started scanning prices for IPAD. I was there FIRST, should the guy entertain me FIRST, as a CUSTOMER? Then another employee ( a woman) came. She looked at me and ignored me. THREE Walmart employees and by myself (a customer). There was NO OTHER CUSTOMER but me. I was there standing and WAITING, WAITING and WAITING. The guy never had a courtesy to to me that it may take minutes (even I told him that I want a ROKU which should be quick as I know what I want).Much worse, the other two employees never bothered to ask me if I need help. Is it because I look different from them? Is it because I am an ASIAN? Avoid going to this store!!!"
1989,43517,JASdav05,14/03/2021,Walmart,I do not think the employees understand the line between customer relations. Cashiers are not needed when most people at one point worked as cashiers before. It does not take a whole lot of thought to run a bar code over or type a numeric code number on produce/vegetable into a computer at checkout.

They uploaded tracking information on the 11th and I was informed by Walmart.com that I would receive my item by the 15th. I called FEDEX on the 15th to find out item never shipped.  After not getting any clear answer from CS of Walmart, I try speaking to a manager who starts yelling at while I am the frustrated customer. First off, you have to be able to listen to the customer first. He never even let me speak and said my only option is to reorder or cancel for full refund.  So after waiting for 10 days for a product which I was anxiously waited for, I decided to cancel the order and buy it else where.  All i got in return was a manager yelling at me and them holding my money for 10 days. Now I was to wait for a $1000 refund.  What an awesome experience....."

1995,46827,Theresa Marino,15/03/2019,Walmart,"Now Walmart is taking away Savings Catcher. Last fall you had to use Walmart Pay in order to use it. I used to saves a lot of money when I brought the ads in. Walmart is a socialist company. Forgive this analogy: You fill a trough with slop and the wild pigs will start coming to eat. You build one side of the fence because the pigs are so happy they have free food. Every time they come to the cheap prices, you build another side of the fence until eventually you have the pigs all caged in. They never knew what was happening. This is what Walmart has done. Made it virtually impossible for other grocery stores to survive. For those people who agree with our laws about illegals, Walmart is one of large corporations, along with our federal government, that have made it so illegals do not have to learn to speak the language. I am offended that Walmart started putting Spanish on all of their food items just to make more money. Eventually Walmart will be the only place that you can purchase ANYTHING, if consumers donâ€™t do something about it."
1996,46828,Eileen M. Murphy,15/03/2019,Walmart,"I purchased a Ceramic Disc Heater from Walmart who used a 3rd party, ToolBoxSupply, to ship the product. I sent 2 messages within 2 hours to ToolBoxSupply to CANCEL my order because I found the exact heater for $30. less at Amazon They have never responded to me and shipped anyway. Walmart said the heater could be returned to any Walmart. Yea, and I was charged almost $19. for it to be returned to ToolBoxSupply. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER will I do business with Walmart again. Amazon doesn't charge u 22% return/restocking fee. Beware of shopping Walmart online, better yet, don't even spend your money with Walmart at all."
1997,45542,Matt Boucher,15/03/2020,Walmart,Please limit your water and toilet paper per customer during this pandemic. Itâ€™s very inconsiderate seeing customers walk out with 6 cases of water.
1998,45543,Carmen Garcia,15/03/2020,Walmart,"I placed an order several days ago and was told my order would be ready on Sunday. While waiting for my order and it being 3 hours late, I wasn't informed they are cancelling all online orders. According to their ""oh so helpful customer service"" I was told ""it is what it is and if I need to shop go to another store."" No indication from their corporate office they are cancelling orders Nationwide...No they aren't saying anything to their customers because they want to keep your business. People are waiting for orders and you place so many families without and all your customer service reps can say ""it is what it is"" try again, people keep your business afloat. You seem so disinterested in the people who shop in your store or online. Imagine if your customers stopped shopping in your stores. The people keep you in business, not your customer service reps with their sarcasm and lack of intellect.."

2000,45545,Catice Mosley,15/03/2020,Walmart,"I want to Put in a complaint. There is no reason why I Was not notified the same day that I put in my order. Yâ€™all took my money ,Let me place my order. Then call me one day later.At 2:00 minutes before I came to pick up my order to say my order was canceled.For one When you try to put in an item in your cart that you are sold out of or out of stock it does not allow you to put it in your cart.SO Why allow me to place an order waste my time shopping online. The way this was handled was unacceptable and absolutely no customer service at all. I am extremely disappointed with Walmart and will never order online again. The sad part is I am a big Walmart fan ,and order online all the time. Never again will I order anything."
2001,45546,Meriem Djalali,15/03/2020,Walmart,I placed an order and I lost my package and I chatted with Walmart customer service representative and it took 1 minute to resolve my issue Iâ€™m so grateful for the customer service you guyâ€™s really deserve more then 5 stars. Big thank you.
2002,43512,Arelis Duran,15/03/2021,Walmart,"I just recently started using walmartâ€™s delivery service. Everything was fine until today when I made an order and It was supposed to get here from 11am-12pm, 12pm came around it wasnâ€™t here It just showed as â€œpreparingâ€ I waited until around 2pm and decided to take action because It was still â€œpreparingâ€. I decided to first try the walmart chat support did not help at ALL, then decided to call support. They said they had a problem with the driver and could not be sent. They asked if I wanted a refund or the order sent again still waiting for it."
2003,43513,Taylor,15/03/2021,Walmart,"I wish I could give 0 stars. Walmart's customer service is atrocious. I ordered a scrub top back in December 2020 and I never received it. When I called to see why, the man I spoke to said it was out of stock. It would've been nice if they called and told me that. Since December until today, I have spoken with 5 different people and they cannot give me a reason why I have not received my refund yet. They all have different answers and when they tell me a supervisor is going to call me, I never hear from them. This is ridiculous and all I want is my freaking refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2004,43514,Gabriel,15/03/2021,Walmart,I bought two headphones here and they specifically told me i could go home and return one of the boxes as long as i did not open it.  i come back a week later and they tell me its non refundable. terrible service. i will never buy electronics from them ever again.
2005,43515,April,15/03/2021,Walmart,Had a terrible experience. Ordered a dining table which was delivered broken. Had a guy show up to put it together that we didnâ€™t ask for and got charged extra for that. They came and took broken table. Then Walmart said we never returned it. They charged me again in my credit card for the table. So I paid twice for sane horrible experience. I am currently disputing this charge.
2006,40798,Ramona Colmenero,15/03/2022,Walmart,"The Walmart in Selma,Ca. has some of the WORST Customer Service Department Ever!! Went there to return a item I purchased at another Walmart Store some 30 miles away. They said I had to return the item to that particular store. I was all Walmart is Walmart I should be able to take care of my return there. We argued and all the â€œghettoâ€ came out of their staff! I had about 5 employees arguing there with me. I think what they need to do is totally get their crew some retraining in Professional customer service classes!! Needless to say I almost got arrested! Yes, good luck shopping there!!"
2007,40799,ariella moor,15/03/2022,Walmart,I went here to buy garden supplies and they had quite a limited selection.. the staff were also avoiding me when I needed help but luckily one of the older staff members helped me. It's pretty busy there and self checkout is usually packed.
2008,45535,Chozen Kendrick,16/03/2020,Walmart,just came back from the eye doctor place (not where they do the eye exams) her name was Celest. she was amazing she went above and beyond and exceeded my expectations. this was the walmart in perris CA
2009,45536,Peggy,16/03/2020,Walmart,Went to order toilet paper. Price is not over charged but they want $30 to ship one case. This should be illegal as well. They have lost me as a customer and everyone else should not shop with them as well. This is so wrong during a crisis
2010,45537,holyrd fariha,16/03/2020,Walmart,Walmart remained always reasonable for me. But for now the situation is not good for people because of Coronavirus. So if Walmart makes a limit like 3 or 2 tissue or other cleaning stuff per person. It would be very helpful for all the aged customers. Otherwise people are making line and crowding on those areas.Which is not a good action for preventing this pandemic situation.
2011,45538,Julie,16/03/2020,Walmart,"I placed an order online on Friday. The items showed available at a specific store in Anaheim, CA. But it stated the earliest pick up would be on Monday. Monday morning I get a call stating that the items that I ordered were no longer available. They sold my items that I ordered over the weekend. They have not caught up to the proper processes of selling items online. When an item says it's in stock, they need to put the item aside when sold. Don't trust their online purchasing. Horrible!"
2012,45539,Brionahhjbj Cannon,16/03/2020,Walmart,"So today 3/16/2020 I was walking in Walmart in the Cedar Hill,TX and an employee was standing by door smoking weed without a care in the world I was highly upset I called the store over and over again to inform the manager and no response"
2013,45540,James Franklin,16/03/2020,Walmart,Cheap and very fast service. Thanks! :)

Orders after order they just kept allowing me to place this order.why
2015,36290,Jeff T.,16/03/2018,Amazon Go,"Suuuper cool concept and feels like I'm shopping in the year 2040...how does it know what I take off the shelf?!  They use a bunch of overhead cameras and somehow tie it to the app you have to download on your phone.  You'll also need this app to actually get through the entrance turnstiles of the store, where you'll also get some free Amazon Go reuseable grocery bags!  I was a little bummed at how small the store actually was and how ""normal"" the prices were.   I wasn't expecting super low prices but some of the products were actually a little more than other stores.  I think the goodness in this store lies with the smaller takeout items (i.e. sandwiches, ready-made pastas, etc) and the meal kits that their known for.  Another perk is the convenient parking just downstairs - it was free for at least 30 minutes!    Once they expand to a larger store, I can see Amazon Go being a huge hit that would add much convenience to everyones' lives."
2016,36348,Jade M.,16/03/2018,Amazon Go,"Cool experience! Make sure you download the Amazon Go App ahead of time so that you can scan in at the entrance. If you have a guest with you they will also scan in using your same device. The store itself isn't very big but they have a wide variety of snacks and ready to eat meals as well as a small commodity item section with toiletries and other items. I'm still amazed at the technology that this store uses. As advertised, you literally walk out when you are done shopping, and then you receive an email with your receipt. Check it out!"
2017,36375,Teri S.,16/03/2019,Amazon Go,"Love it! Walk in. Grab-n-Go. Walk out. No lines. Within a few minutes, I get an itemized receipt emailed to me and it had never been wrong! Before your first entry, you need to download the Amazon Go app. You use the app to scan in through the automated turnstiles each time you visit. You can scan in friends as well, however, keep in mind that you will be charged for any items people you scan in purchase. Amazon Go is a cross between a mini-mart and a grocery store. There are many pre-made sandwiches, snacks, and single serving drinks. There are also basic groceries like dairy, wine, beer, pantry staples, and some fresh produce. There are customer service people to help you and answer questions. However if you don't want human contact, it isn't necessary unless you purchase alcohol. You will be carded by a live person."
2018,36381,Marlon O.,16/03/2019,Amazon Go,This shit was crazy! Working in Seattle and had to stop in and see what was up. Never been to the one we have in San Francisco. Couldn't help but want to try and get away with what would probably stealing but not stealing! Well... I don't think it could be done. The got dam place accurately billed me for shit I had got and didn't for the shit I put back. I'm figure out how to steal from this fucking place when I'm back in Seattle in March. Can it be done? Hmmm...
2019,43509,mjc,16/03/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a set of king size sheets online, according to the site returns were easy just use the order number, I received the sheets but the color was not a match so I returned them unopened, only the shipping package was opened, I had paid with a debit cash card but was not refunded, I was told that it was a third party vendor I had gotten the sheets from and as soon as they received them I would be refunded, after two days or 48 hours,after 2 days, I contacted fedex because I could not track the return with the number Walmart provided, per fedex that number was no good, so I contacted Lanie a representative with Walmart, she did not reply when I told her the tracking number was no good, she just explained again about the third party vendor issue, she claimed she started an escalated ticket to them and I would be refunded by Monday, I was not refunded so I called back and got Sara, I later found out that was a lie,when I asked if her name was Sara because she said it so fast when she answered, I even spelled it, she said yes, come to find out her name is Susie so she even lied about that, she did not care at all or want to help me, she finally tried contacting the third party and they hung up on her, she told me I would just have to wait another 48 hours so now 6 days to be refunded, I still have not been refunded and can not contact the third party vendor and get no real help from Walmart, I would caution anyone from buying online from them unless you don't care if they take your money and give you the finger for it."
2020,43510,Sharon Langley,16/03/2021,Walmart,"Serious problems with shipping.My last two orders were both sent to some crazy place no where near here,lost ?How does this happen ? I didn't realize my orders were coming from overseas either,maybe the problem?"
2021,43511,Michael Brown,16/03/2021,Walmart,Why Walmart have changed employees with the personal checking that's not acceptable you are not just carrying your stuff around and they make you check your own stuff for them for free why is that okay???
2022,40793,RICHARD BACCARIE,16/03/2022,Walmart,I have been waiting for the people at Walmart to give my money back for a stupid $12 dollar workout band set. I've spoke with them by chat three times and by phone twice. They say it had been delivered on Friday 11 March at 11. When I called on the 14th they said call on the 15 and you'll get your money back. Then the 15th came and I called them again. Then they said we can't give you your money until tomorrow . I said do you need this money that bad that you can't give me my money. I said you guys can keep it. And I will never shop at Walmart again. Amazon and Ebay along with others will get my money. Policies like that make it very easy for people to leave your company.  Richard L Baccarie United States Marine Corps Retired
2023,40794,Mike Greene,16/03/2022,Walmart,Just 2 days ago I bought 2 Raspberry plants and 2 Blackberry plants in your Showlow store. Today I was planting them and when I opened the plants to rinse the roots and plant them....to my surprise there was only a couple old spindly roots at the bottom... The instructions said to spread the roots and make them lay in the hole!!!!! That's a joke! I live about 50 miles 1 way to my nearest Walmart. I guess at 6.95 each + tax it isn't worth what diesel fuel costs to return them! NEVER AGAIN!!! I won't buy plants from Walmart again and I recommend you don't get suckered by a nice picture on the label! Now I know some are thinking i am a dumb _ _ _ and so am I!
2024,40795,Nobody,16/03/2022,Walmart,"I ordered a bottle of lotion shown on Walmart.com for $9.47 and free shipping. It arrived a few days later with SIXTY DOLLARS in shipping charges! I confirmed free shipping on the Walmart site and then walked through the order process to find that the vendorscammer (SupreMed) tacked on the ripoff charge in small font on the very last page where the order is finalized. I called the vendor who played hardball and refused to refund shipping. I then appealed to Walmart who confirmed ""free shipping from Walmart"" but defended the last-minute shipping charge from the vendor. In the end I was screwed for $60 on a product sold for less than $10. NEVER AGAIN."
2025,40796,Christine Robinson,16/03/2022,Walmart,"I ordered a pair of size 10 shoes online from Walmart. They arrived in a box labeled size 10. The shoes are labeled size 9, and they look even smaller than size 9. Walmart is outsourcing orders they can't complete themselves, this is the second time the wrong size item arrived. Orders used to arrive with a return shipping label, that is no longer the case. Walmart accepts no responsibility."
2026,40797,Hannah,16/03/2022,Walmart,"This review is specifically regarding Walmart+ (Delivery From Store.) 9/10 times I have used Walmart+, that I pay $10 monthly for, there have been no substitutions available on extremely simple items - literal bread was cancelled from my order last time because they didn't have anything similar to ""italian white"". How about literally any other white bread? How about you offer a way for your oafish in-store shoppers to contact the customer, instead of being lazy and just cancelling the item? Walmart should be ashamed of their online ordering and home delivery processes, as a retailer that made headlines for offering grocery delivery at the beginning of the pandemic, they are the worst of the worst in 2022. I'm cancelling my final Walmart+ order that was scheduled for 6pm tonight (your shopper chose to substitute one item, with 4 packs of 2 similar items, instead of the 12 pack I ordered... for the same price... does 8 = 12?) and cancelled an alcohol purchase due to being out of stock. Why is alcohol not substituted when other items are? And why is something as simple as bread cancelled when there are literal hundreds of alternatives available? Shame on you.  I only use Walmart+ for home delivery and when I have to leave my home for something as simple as a loaf of bread that was cancelled from my order, something is very wrong with your inventory and employee management."
2027,46824,Marv,17/03/2019,Walmart,"Recently I received notification that Walmart was discontinuing the Savings Catcher program as it had, in effect, ""proven"" that Walmart has the lowest prices overall. This is just another way Walmart giveth and taketh away.  The Walmart store in Lake Delton, Wisconsin hasn't been giving, but has been taking. The national brands offered have shrunken significantly only to be replaced with the Great Value brand.  While GV does normally offer a lower price, my guess would be that Walmart gets a better profit margin from these items as well.  We have a small local grocery available and I am switching most of my shopping there. It does cost a bit more, but the service is heads and shoulders above that provided by Walmart. The local store actually helps you find items and takes your groceries to your car."
2028,46825,ST.v.D.,17/03/2019,Walmart,Thank god for a walmart. Itâ€™s the best quality for the best price.
2029,46826,Martin Juarez,17/03/2019,Walmart,I am thankful to live close to a Walmart Super Center. I make most of my home shopping there. Their prices are always low and help my money last longer. Thank you Walmart Super Center for existing in Laredo.
2030,45528,Really Real,17/03/2020,Walmart,"Absolutely terrible customer service. Tracking order states attempted delivery unable to deliver...no delivery attempt was made! No one responded to the chat and the call center customer service person hung up on me when she told me after being on hold 7 minutes,that she reached the carrier and it would be delivered tomorrow. So I told her to call them back and deliver it today..so she hung up ..."
2031,45529,Aya Portis,17/03/2020,Walmart,I ordered a tv on March 8 was supposed to receive it on March 13 did not get it because fedex never delivered. I even called them on the same day they say i got it and still no resolution. They've been giving me the run around asking for police reports like im the one who stole it and still have not got a refund from theses janky people never will i ever order online from walmart again....one of the supervisors janean even hung up on me. The customer service here is beyond horrible all i want is my 278.00 back i dont want anything from them. My advice to anyone looking to order anything online from them DO NOT you might just catch a case dealing with the foolery that they put you through.
2032,45530,Brayden Piper,17/03/2020,Walmart,The lines were very slow and they tell you a few minutes but it ends up being more like 30 minutes. Sometimes I just have a few things to get and it is worthless waiting in the line.

2034,45532,mistie howell,17/03/2020,Walmart,Ha ha all your review are bad ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜œ get your crap together walmart.com for real. It appears most are complaining about groceries well we was sold a locked phone that is completely useless ðŸ˜¡ we are out the cost of that phone which with everything that happened the apple id is messed up. Out the cost of the insurance policy. Out the cost of a 25 gift card . No refund or gaf just oh so in so team said I don't give a crap what they say I want to speak with a manager. Bunch of crap never using them again ever
2035,45533,Giovanna Carreon,17/03/2020,Walmart,Well first of all yâ€™all need to stock up on everything and donâ€™t let Anyone take so much stuff because of the coronavirus ok and make everyone limit themselves because they are taking so much and some of us need those things and they are taking them all so ya stop freaking out
2036,45534,Rebekah Jordan,17/03/2020,Walmart,"I spent over an hour this weekend setting up the online grocery ordering app, ordering, choosing a reservation pickup time and paying. I get home from work today and go in to check my staus for pickup only to see it say I cancelled my order - I didnt cancel the order. I called and the women said ""oh yea there was a glitch and your order was cancelled by us"" I ask a few questions about reordering only to find out there are no longer any reservations available. Her solution?! Log on at midnight to see if i can get one of the spots for next week (7 days from now). If I wanted groceries next week i would shop next week. I will NEVER use this app or walmart grocery again. Worst customer service ever. Oh and it will be 4-5 days before my money is returned."
2037,43507,Ebony White,17/03/2021,Walmart,"Terrible customer service! My problem with this store is that no one will help you look for items. They are either too busy, it's not their department, or they don't speak English and cant help me. They literally will walk away from you. It's crazy I can't get any help in the store but when it's time to leave you have employees ready to check my receipt. You won't help me while I'm shopping and then have the audacity to ask for my receipt. And even though their website says they are enforcing social distancing, they are not. Last night, Walmart associates watched as I asked this stupid man to please give me some space while standing in line. No one said anything and no one asked the customers in the line to stand 6 feet a part after the argument I had with the stupid male customer. I will be shopping again but I ain't showing my receipt at the door."
2038,43508,Lisa G,17/03/2021,Walmart,"Zero is the number of stars I would like to leave. I attempted to place an online grocery pickup order. So fast forward to checkout. Entered my payment info and pushed submit. Did nothing. Pushed submit again. Submit was still highlighted. At this point, I decide to restart my phone and finally submit my order. Attempted again...still nothing. Irritated, I decided to just go pick up my items myself. But first decided to check my card balance. Here this damn portal zapped my card each time I pushed submit. So damn near $400 AND NOT EVEN A DAMN JUG OF MILK TO SHOW FOR IT!!! I'm not sure what pissed me off more? The system fail or the ""sorry about your luck attitude I got from customer service""!!!! I did find out that they were aware of the issue and that I wasn't the first. It has happened to several. My question is...why the hell wouldn't they temporarily shut down the site until it was ok to use??? I was told the I~T department was working on it. Was suggested to call the number on the back of my card. Now I'm sure you know, most companies are prompting you to go on their website (chances of you talking to damn human is slim)! So after several calls to walmart as well as my cardholder...here it is Wednesday and still nothing!!! This happened on Sat. WAS a faithful customer!!!"

2040,40790,Angela Burns,17/03/2022,Walmart,"it is garbage customer service to have faulty equipment in their store, right next to the service desk. when atm kept my card and shut off completely, I was told to call number on the atm(cash depot) who was garbage too, because they said it wasn't their machine, it was Walmart's then the manager on duty passed the buck back to cash depot.. upon calling corporate, I was told to contact my bank and ""just get another card"". as a result of this fiasco, and all the buck passing between cash depot and Walmart corporate even,, I couldn't get an answer on who to call about my stuck atm card, I was late for work, and I cant access my bank account or money on a WEEKEND all because a manger couldn't take initiative to call DIEBOLD the brand of ATM and request service IMMEDIATELY. here's the number you jokers.. please call them and take some accountability. I almost ran out of gas and I will have to borrow gas money because of Walmarts lack of accountability Diebold, 8003432653"
2041,40791,Carl Young,17/03/2022,Walmart,Ordered pictures of landscape scenes and got a box of gloves instead for one of them. Been over two weeks and have not seen the other 3. Walmart has a terrible habit of endorsing scams to screw you over. As much money as walmart makes they would at least honor the order or give a refund. They have done nothing. Pretty lame walmart...I am done purchasing from you.
2042,40792,Charlene Catello,17/03/2022,Walmart,"Walmart.com+ is a joke . I used it once & they kept charging my credit card for monthly fees of $12.95 even though I had opted out of the membership immediately after that 1 order . I hated Walmart before the pandemic when Like so many had no other option but to shop online & from Walmart & a few other places that have very little of what I need in our house on a weekly & regular basis , was never intending on paying them $13/mo for legally monopolizing the online business , along with their profits ,that increased faster than covid did ,& am having the most difficult time getting anyone @their 1800# to give a shot abt their job to help get this matter resolved for 4 months & after $52 wasted ! They are nothjng but greedy thieves with no integrity or worth yet they are up there with Amazon who is also greedy & rotten to employees but are better than Walmart !  Anyone having delivery issues most ups & fed ex shipments are covered fof up to $100 automatically file a claim with any lost or mistakenly delivered to wrong address items . It takes 6 months but you must fule the claim directly with the shipper on these types of problems (shipping issues !) good luck"
2043,47219,Jim Yocum,18/03/2017,Walmart,"Walmart.com is not like dealing with Walmart they have selling partnership and neither Walmart or their partners will stand behind your order..They play the blame game on each other while the costumer gets the shaft..False advertising, cancelled orders, headache, waiting, emails,and fighting for refunds for stuff you didn't order or not receiving your order is what you get at Walmart.com .Don't expect any help from Walmart or the selling partnerships it's a scam on massive level..DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STAY AWAY from Walmart.Com the free shipping sounds good until you get what you didn't order,or they cancel your order while holding your money for no apparent reason or explanation of why"
2044,45524,R,18/03/2020,Walmart,"Extremely disappointed. Walmart has always been quick to ship and I have no complaints. However, after waiting a week for an item it finally arrived and it was the completely wrong item. I waited almost an hour to speak with someone and their solution? Send me another one and give me a $2 refund. $2? Seams like a joke.... The lady said she couldn't give me a promo code because the computer wasn't allowing her and it would ""take too long to try to fix it"". REALLY? Very disappointed to say the least."
2045,45525,C. Ordonez,18/03/2020,Walmart,"I live in Houston, Texas, and just used pickup at a local Walmart (South Rice location). The associate who handled our items did an excellent job. The website was clear and easy to navigate. I especially appreciated seeing the items notated that were out of stock. Overall, it was a very positive experience and I would not hesitate to recommend Walmart to my friends and neighbors."
2046,45526,gemstonemom,18/03/2020,Walmart,"DON'T SHOP HERE - WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!  I wish I could give them a negative rating. I placed an online grocery order with Walmart on 3/12/20, I was informed, the day I was to pick it up (3/16/20), it had been cancelled. I get the fact that the shelves were empty due to the doomsdayers, hoarders and ""the end is nigh"" panic-buying. I'm not angry about that at all......what has got me so upset is that I called to find out why the order was cancelled and to find out when my money would be refunded. Customer service was extremely unhelpful - almost as though they were reading from a script. I decided to follow up with an email, no response at all! Here it is, the 18th of March and the charge STILL hasn't been refunded to my credit card. Now, $95.00 isn't a lot of money, but as I am facing hours being cut at work due to the pandemic - $95.00 makes a huge difference in my budget! What is my next step? Small Claims Court? Instituting a Class Action suit with other people in the same boat? I'm at a loss and just want my money back for product I did not receive!!"
2047,45527,Santos Aloi,18/03/2020,Walmart,"I am given one star because I can not give them MINUS !!!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. I purchased a brand new freezer and not only it came with several dents but it WAS NOT WORKING. I wasted LOT OF FOOD because I was not aware about that defect. Lost more than $ 140 in food that went to waste. After being on the phone several times with different representatives describing this scenario I spoke with a Supervisor, Kevin, who promised to solve the issue. Instead another nightmare started. They promised me a refund that will take 5 days. Nothing happens. USPS that partners them to deliver and pick up their products did not came to pick up the defective device on time. I had to be on the phone with USPS MULTIPLE times to try to get the pick up right. However this did not ended: I was offer to be given another device ASAP. It took 12 DAYS!!! I call Walmart. They said that they cannot issue the refund based on the fact that according to their records and contacting USPS they don't have evidence that the product was return. The associated that was on the phone with me was so disrespectful that you cannot imagine. I asked to talk to supervisor and spoke with Daniela She said she was sorry!!! and give me a small discount.....The new freezer arrived with SEVERAL DENTS too. So NEVER EVER PURCHASE FROM WALMART. COM unless you want to be over stress with their poor quality products and worst customer service.They are the worst !"
2048,36311,Sania I.,18/03/2018,Amazon Go,"Amazon Go all I have to say is WOW. If you haven't gone you need to go because the technology is amazing the whole idea and concept behind walking into a grocery store and walking out is revolutionary concept and great that Amazon pulled it off. This is not a place you want to come and do your grocery shopping but it's a good convenient store. Amazon Go is a awesome place to check out maybe grab a drink, some food, or some snacks. Also they actually sell alcohol. I did ask the associate working on how the whole regulations work it and she said there has to be an employee working who checks ID and then you're able to grab your alcoholic beverage and walk out.  The whole idea behind Amazon go is amazing so if you haven't gone yet definitely go and check it out. Amazon Go is closed on the weekends and open until 9pm on weekdays. Also you do need to download the Amazon Go app and if you're planning to come with family they don't need to download the app, one is sufficient enough to get everyone inside."
2049,40784,Ronald Aguayo,18/03/2022,Walmart,"Although it may be difficult working with us customers, shopping can be good. Prices affordable, sometimes items can be lacking. Perhaps shipping concerns. Overall,I believe improvement is coming."
2050,40785,Jasmine Simplot,18/03/2022,Walmart,I had gotten and emain saying my pre order from a year ago was canceled.so concerned I was i called customer service and said it was out of stock even tho I had it on pre-order. I asked why I didn't get it when it was in shock and never got an answer and after arguing for over 10 minutes I had enough. I highly recommend never pre-ordering thru walmart and I myself will never again.
2051,40786,Barb Ingrey,18/03/2022,Walmart,"Argyle mall, London Ontario has terrible customer service in the pharmacy. I was treated rudely by the pharmacist and the associate because when no one was around at the cash register and the line was 6 people deep. I tried to get the attention of the only person behind the counter and was ignored, then was told I had no business talking to her. The associate rounded the counter and demanded to know what I wanted. The line up of 6 people wasn't enough of a clue. I reported this and I have never heard from anyone. I use a much friendlier pharmacy down the road called coulter pharmacy. Customer service is top priority there. Since the store was not interested in what transpired, I no longer go to the argyle Walmart as I have used other Walmart's in London first. Wish Zellers had lasted."
2052,40787,Haunani De Guzman,18/03/2022,Walmart,"Hi, I would like to COMMEND all your employees in the Pharmacy Department, pharmacists: Cameron, Wayne, Assistants and all associates. Janice, Adam, Eries, etc. They're the Greatest, Friendliest, Awesome, Amazing group of wonderful people. I have made my choice to stay at the Walmart store on Eastern and Serene. Please acknowledge your pharmacy. Aloha Annette and Van de Guzman. Thank you and GOD BLESS."
2053,40788,Anthony Stark,18/03/2022,Walmart,Walmart has the worst online and delivery service ever. Everything is either delayed or there are items missing. The chat people read off a script and apologize a lot. Save yourself a lot of grief and use Amazon instead. The only reason they get two stars is because the stores themselves are okay to shop at in person.

2055,45520,Ernie,19/03/2020,Walmart,"I've ordered two movie packs, American Graffiti 1 & 2 and X-Files season 11, over the past few weeks. Boths items were advertised as new, of course, but both arrived used and re-shrink-wrapped. They weren't in terrible shape, but there were light scratches and bruises enough to show that they were clearly used. This is the kind of poo you might expect from the crooks selling on eBay, but not from someone affiliated with Walmart. I kept the American Graffiti, but asked the associate to forward my concerns. Today, fighting through Corona Land for the pickup, I sent the X-Files season back. The on-site manager tried to tell me that Walmart is not responsible for Walmart.com. Well, I'm not buying it. And I'm not buying anymore supposed-to-be new but actually used and shrink-re-wrapped items from Walmart. I don't even accept this sort of crooked dealing from eBay, and sure won't from Walmart. If this is the best that you can do, you may as well shut it down. I'm done with it, anyway."

2060,40779,Brian Johnson,19/03/2022,Walmart,"DO NOT ORDER FROM Walmart.com!!!! They CANNOT BE TRUSTED!! Their online customer service is overseas. They delivered part of my order. I ordered perfume. I needed this for a special gift. I ordered far enough in advance. They changed the status from ""On The Way"" to ""Your Order Is Delayed, Keep checking back for updates"" This continued for three days past their date of delivery. I called customer service, I kept getting people with Arabic accents claiming American names, that they couldn't even pronounce. I was told to wait 24 hours, and then wait for three days before calling back for a refund. They now claim to have to get in touch with a third party vendor. I gave my money to Walmart. That was My First Mistake. I still have No Perfume and My Money Has Not Been Refunded. I finally decided to sue them for my refund. THIS IS REDICULOUS! SO IF YOU ARE READING THIS, DO NOT BY ANYTHING FROM WALMART.COM."
2061,40780,Marlene Smith,19/03/2022,Walmart,"I purchase a lot of pet supplies from this company. They have really messed up the delivery options lately. I want everything shipped just like they used to, not one thing from a store today and another thing from a store tomorrow. Go back to my request for shipping everything. You do not need to find ways to ways to save a FEW bucks."
2062,40781,James Evans,19/03/2022,Walmart,I ordered 3 marine batteries and was told to pick them up. Then 2 batteries were cancelled because they were out of stock at the local Walmart. I cancelled the third. Two days later I ordered 1 battery and was told to pick it up. When I got to the store I was told the order was cancelled again because it was out of stock. Of course the price went up between the orders too. I would have been happy if Walmart notified me when the first order could have been filled.
2063,40782,shawn miller,19/03/2022,Walmart,"online ordering works just fine most of the times, some items are always out of stock."
2064,40783,Glenda Pope,19/03/2022,Walmart,I'm giving Walmart 1 star because it won't let me give a 0. Be careful ordering online because alot of their online items are cheap as if they come from WISH. Clothing too! I've had to return the last 3 items I've purchased because it was wrong size and/or  not what they advertised. And make sure you check the shipping because alot of times the shipping is more than the product itself. I'll never again order online thru Walmart.
2065,47304,Dan Stark,20/03/2016,Walmart,"Ordered a TV with rush shipping. The order was confirmed and my debit card was charged, but my TV never arrived on the delivery date stated in the email. A call to customer service revealed the TV never shipped to begin with, so I cancelled the order. Days later the order is still listed as ""processing"", and my money is still in Walmart's hands. Calls to customer service got me nowhere. Usually I'd get a scripted response. One rep put me on a speaker phone and ridiculed me while other staff can be heard giggling in the background. Another told me that he went into the system, cancelled my order, and refunded my card, which turned out to be a bold-faced lie. This has been nothing short of a nightmare, with hundreds of dollars up in the air. Avoid buying from these people at all costs."
2066,46821,Grace Deen,20/03/2019,Walmart,"Order (2) TVs from Walmart.com and paid for both of them with debit card. I was notify on March 1st both TV's were ready for pickup at the Spring, TX - Aldine Westfield Location. With receipt in my possession I show up at the Pickup counter to retrieve the (2) TV. The representative assisting me with the transaction was login under another employee ID - C.J! When I handed her the receipt to retrieve the (2) TV's it took her longer than usual to complete the transaction. However, using another employee login - A. is her first initial refunded (1) of the TV's making it seems like I had taken both of them deliberately after receiving a refund for 1 and only paying for the other. I realize what A. did when I was retrieve my email and email linked to my Walmart account showed refund for (1) of the TV! I immediately contacted the Chat option and told the Walmart Representative I had both TV's in my possession and Representative had refunded 1 in error. But my main focus was on the refund transaction! Did A. refund to the original form of payment or back to gift card in which A. place in her possession. What a huge mess this has caused me - LOW LIFE B.B. CAUSED ME - A. After I realize what she did - A. - She works at the customer service counter - 24809 Aldine Westfield Road Spring TX! She needs to be FIRED! After I discovered the ordeal I decided to contact Walmart again and told the representative to refund the other TV as well and I would return both TVs! I did return both TV's today - 18th of March - using the return labels forward to my email after communicating with a Walmart representative. The Walmart chat representative was very apologetic and forward to my email Federal Express return labels. I decided I would drive to Federal Express to have both TVs shipped to Walmart warehouse as refund merchandize. I left Federal Express Location and then drove to the Walmart store location to figure out her real name and low and behold she is still working there within the customer service booth - Her first name begin with A. The purchase products were great - Five Stars - for the Sceptre TV's - but the customer service I receive from A.- representing Walmart - is the least to be desire - The person A.representing Walmart has wasted my time and now I will start over to purchase 2 more TV's but not from Walmart- Horrible Customer Service from representative - A.!"
2067,46822,Darwin Briceno,20/03/2019,Walmart,I ordered 2 cages for a total of 399.00 online and 48 hours later I received a text message from the vendor saying that they were out of the items that I ordered and that they were going to upgrade me to the next kennel that was a better quality. I looked at the upgrade and it did not have any of the features that I needed so I decided to get a refund and pass on the upgrade. It took Walmart 7 days to get my money back on my account. I ordered online again 2 other cages and after placing the order again the same thing happened for a second time....(horrible) I feel like its a bait and switch scheme. So after going thru the same experience a second time I finally got a representative that spoke English and could understand my issue and even with their help and them placing the order for a third time my order still did not go thru because the items were out of stock but I still got charged the 399.00 twice and have to wait 5 to 7 business days to get my money back so that I can find a vendor that will deliver.....very upset and disappointing that a simple item cant be changed to an other with the same company...I dont think I will be ordering online with Walmart any time soon.

2070,45519,Jan,20/03/2020,Walmart,"The shutdown at night for ""sanitation and restocking"" at Walmart is a joke. This morning we went at 7am for the ""special"" hour for seniors. There was NO wet wipes to wipe off the cart handles. The shelves were not stocked, employees were pushing huge ""stocking carts"" through the store being in everyone's way while the ""seniors"" were trying to shop because of the susceptibility of elderly people to the Coronavirus. I saw many young people that were definitely NOT seniors in the store making purchases. This was a perfect opportunity for Walmart to show their customers their commitment to them in times of trouble. In my opinion Walmart has NOT stepped up to the plate, although they certainly are taking advantage of the situation. I'll admit I dislike Walmart, but unfortunately, I also have admit they are a necessary evil."

On 12/9 I received an email saying my dvd was on back order, on 12/13 I received an email saying they canceled my order. I was counting on that dvd for a Christmas present, they shouldnâ€™t let you order it online if they donâ€™t even have enough copies in stock. This is my second time having a problem with ordering online from them. The first was I ordered a Funko pop online, and that arrived a week later than it was supposed to, and I had purchased that as a birthday present. Walmart online is 0/2 with me."

2073,43505,Thomas,20/03/2021,Walmart,"Theres As many scam sellers and fake goods here on walmart.com as on ebay only with NO *REAL* buyer protection on Wal-Mart.com Take usb flash drives for instance. 2 legitimate name brands then hundreds of listings for identical fakes that are a fraction of listed capacity.  Taking the risk would be fine if it was Amazon or ebay with returns of such items being covered and refunds guaranteed. Wal-Mart.com return policy however, only vaguely and deceptively says most return shipping fees are covered (they most certainly ARE NOT. no scam seller is going to offer covered return shipping and there's THOUSANDS of listings from them) but to check with each seller. ONLY there's NO way to contact a seller until AFTER you already buy the item.  So you get your terabyte flash drive delivered only to find out that its ACTUALLY a 32 gb drive with a false stamp or print saying ""2 TB"" and with the internal info set to show that capacity is 2 tb when you plug it in. It will let you add all those files as if it's working while in reality it's actually ""writing"" to space that isnt there so you end up with a drive full of 32 gigabytes of corrupted data. If you were cautious, you copied files onto it instead of cut and paste otherwise those files are permanently gone. Now that you bought an item you can finally contact the seller about return info only to learn that return shipping isn't covered and costs more than the item you want to return because they want you to ship the product to CHINA to be returned. In other words thanks for the money, enjoy your fake product, and have fun with your lost data.  This is the same type of Chinese counterfeit as the fake name brand sd cards that plague ebay and newegg that also read in your devices that they are correct capacity when in reality they are a fraction of that and the card is simply programmed to falsely list capacity to your device.  At least on ebay and Amazon you TRULY are protected if you come across this and get all purchase related costs including shipping refunded to you, while Walmart will just stick you with the cost and assume zero responsibility for allowing hundreds of scammer merchants and thousands of fake goods sold by third parties under the name of walmarts website. As far as I'm concerned Wal-Mart is just as complicit because they know it's happening, are also profitting from such sales, are vague about relevant policy details, and only allow you to check with sellers to try to get return policy details AFTER youve already been ripped off, and are doing NOTHING to stop it or protect the consumers.  It's funny and interesting that the disclaimer that ""walmart hasnt verified the product info"" ONLY appear on listings that contain these fake knockoffs. That disclaimer is nowhere to be found on the listings of reputable sellers. Keep telling yourself that Wal-Mart doesn't suspect or see red flags but let it continue anyway.  If its looks too good to be true it probably is one of these scams but you're better off not even doing business on Wal-Mart.com until they offer some legitimate form of protection for fake goods and begin actively screening for sales of fakes and create an environment that penalizes and makes it unprofitable to sell fake goods like many OTHER websites have done."
2074,43506,Tim Young,20/03/2021,Walmart,"So I was interested in a shotgun at my first Walmart but was told only one person in the store is legally allowed to sell it. Oh sorry did I say in the store I meant not working yet. He would be in at 1:00 it's now 10:00 in the morning. So I thought no big deal I'll just run to the next closest one about 20 minutes farther away. I get there walk back to the sporting goods department and see two sale associates working the counter and a line of people waiting patiently. So I get in line and wait my turn, all along reading a sign that says gun sale from 8 to 6 Monday thur Sunday. Not long of a wait and it's my turn. I tell the sale associate that I am interested in the shotgun behind him. Guess what neither associate can sell a firearm the only guy that can just went to lunch and won't be back for an hour and a half. So do I wait or just go home? Come on Walmart get your act together and get more people licensed to sell."

2078,46820,WLK,21/03/2019,Walmart,"This is for Walmart.com only, not their brick and mortar stores. Pricing on walmart.com is usually pretty good and even better than in store prices sometimes. They only get two stars however because of their awful search engine and website. Search results often are bizzare! You might do a very specific search for a single item like a tool and get underwear in the results. In addition, they show in store products that are supposedly available but usually aren't and in most cases items appear that are in store but they won't show prices! That's just pointless and frustrating. The pickup desk in stores is often unattended but the clerks do a good job. Also, with many products the selection of items on walmart.com is surprisingly limited when you specify only walmart as a seller. That seems crazy for a giant retailer like walmart. They are often overrun by other retailers selling items on their website similar to the way amazon has ""marketplace"" sellers giving the buyer more choices to buy from someone else than walmart. (I only buy from walmart as seller for safety and warranty reasons). I reluctantly use walmart.com sparingly as it's just not well organized and the offerings are slim in some cases startling so. They need to hire whoever setup amazons website ir use it as a model because it's far superior in every respect!"
2079,45513,Barry Pearson,21/03/2020,Walmart,"Walmart delivery drivers need to be wearing a shirt or vest showing that is who they are.

The problem is they charged me on my credit card. After 7 business days without receiving the refund, I called Walmart and waited for over 2 hours, no one answered the call. Then I called the store 9427 Culebra Rd in San Antonio, TX. A lady, self-claimed store manager, refused to refund the money unless I bring in a printed credit card statement. I told her I can bring in a digital statement because nowadays everything is digital. She said no without any further discussion. She also told me sheâ€™s the only one in store having the final saying. So either her way of doing things, or no way. Iâ€™m speechless. I donâ€™t know other people. But to me, no more Walmart shopping."

2085,43501,Dan Johnson,21/03/2021,Walmart,Itâ€™s all about customer service. Unclean conditions. Employee bum rushed her way through stepping on my sons foot. No apologies. No carts. 54th street is the worst Walmart ever.

2087,43503,Sarah Monroe,21/03/2021,Walmart,I used to work at Walmart store 3646 in Goose Creek SC and just checked my bank acct and noticed they took back my final paycheck. They STOLE my money.
2088,40776,Mark B.,21/03/2022,Walmart,"The online buying service, Walmart.com is broken. Ordered a GPS on Walmart.com with a warranty (over $200). It has been 2 weeks and the GPS has not been shipped. No response from seller. Trying to get my money back. Use Walmart.com at your own risk. I will try to get the money from my credit card."

2090,47303,Kent Bliss,22/03/2016,Walmart,"BUYER BEWARE! DON'T EVER WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A WALMART EXTENDED WARRANTY! I bought a 70"" Vizio TV on sale in November and spent an additional $96 for a warranty. 4 months into ownership, we were watching it one evening and the picture slowly faded out and turned to black over 30 seconds. Several calls and a service tech coming out to my house later, deemed the TV unrepairable?? Now the warranty company says its their option to replace the TV OR refund the purchase price. This model is still available for purchase, but they are refunding the sale price I paid. I can't repurchase the TV for that price. So now I have a 70"" non working TV AND I completely wasted $96... I plan to keep reposting this here and any other social media site to make sure other people donâ€™t get taken by a BS warranty. Spoke with a second supervisor today. I told her the same model TV is still listed on walmart.com for $100 more than I paid for it. She said ."
2091,47218,Susan Marschall,22/03/2017,Walmart,"I know a lot of people are just on the fence or downright dislike Walmart but I totally love them, especially the online ordering. I like that they are in competition with Amazon to the point that they started a program of 2 day shipping like Amazons ""Prime"". The completion keeps the prices down and Amazon actually has a feature on the site that allows me to check their prices against Walmart and truth be told there is at times a bit of a discrepancy so I am glad for that feature and will kind of be using it against Amazon . Also Walmart has the Roll back prices etc for you to take advantage of . WHICH I DO WAY TOO OFTEN!!! But its wonderful to shop both on line and in the store, I love their Mainstay line of items and will continue to shop there, I totally 100% Love to shop with them."

2095,45511,Alaina,22/03/2020,Walmart,"Currently wal mart sucks because of the nut jobs taking everything off the shelves. So I canâ€™t even shop. Other than that, I like the low prices on most of the things they sell. The off brand is pretty much exactly the name brand. And they offer more off brand things than our Wegmans in upstate NY does. Which helps when youâ€™re a single mom with 2 kids. The clearance isle is nice after the holidays! Everything is so cheap, like the price it should be sold at to begin with! It has its pros and cons. Overall I like it but I donâ€™t LOVE it. If I was banking bucks Iâ€™d choose Wegmans over Walmart. Oh! And the wait time for an employee is AWFUL! They arenâ€™t doing anything anymore since they have 2 people at a register cashing people Out. Itâ€™s just ridiculous. I had waited at the elections counter for 30 mins (I didnâ€™t leave because I was browsing anyways) and still nobody had shown up. Even after someone spoke to us! I left when I was done browsing."
2096,45512,Marlena Ladner,22/03/2020,Walmart,Walmart always has what I'm looking for.Their prices are lower than everybody else's and you get value for what you buy.Their customer service is excellent and they are really friendly.I Give Wal-Mart 4 stars.
2097,45587,Jonathan,22/03/2020,Walmart,Did not get my delivery. Ups does not recognize the tracking number walmart gave me. Customer support is not responding. I want my money back. I will never buy from them again. Edit: finally got a response from customer support. They overnighted me a replacement. Must have spent more on shipping than the value of the product. That brings my rating back to neutral.
2098,43499,MERVYN E GABRIEL,22/03/2021,Walmart,"Disgusting service from Walmart Rewards Card!! If I ran my business like this I would have been bankrupt ages ago. They sent my statements to the wrong address ( they encoded it without my unit number). As soon as I enquired they apologized and I paid online within 5 minutes. Then they promised there would be a zero balance.. Statement arrived for Interest charge. Paid the interest after being told there was no mechanism to correct. Paid the interest and was promised zero balance. New statement just arrived for $0.13!!!! Calls fielded offshore by totally incompetent staff. After waiting nearly 30 minutes and having to repeat my credentials 3 times to 3 agents, Now told a supervisor has to call me to discuss. HARD TO BELIEVE!!! I'm on the verge of having a stroke!!!"
2099,43500,Ed S,22/03/2021,Walmart,"I went to Walmart #308 in Manchester, TN this evening, March 21, 2021. There were people wrapped back and forth at the self checkouts in two long lines. No registers were open for anyone to check customers out. I went to customer service to ask about opening a register so we could get our items. They said they didnâ€™t have one employee in the entire store that could run a register. I will not use self checkout. One employee runs multiple registers taking jobs from American workers. Walmart does not reduce the price of merchandise for me to do someone elseâ€™s job. When Sam Walton was alive it was Walmart policy to open another register if more than three people were in one line. Made in America was also a staple at Walmart. Walmart continuously provides poor customer service."
2100,40773,Rosie Dunn,22/03/2022,Walmart,I purchased a bag via Walmart from a company named Focus Clothing Bag Accessories and I am very pleased with the purse/cross body bag.

There were 11 debit cards, in my name, that I've never seen. So, people with my name, have their debit cards on my account. The default card just wanted the CVV to charge it to that card. So if I could've guessed that 3 digit #, it would charge that guys card. This is a serious issue that apparently they don't wanna deal with. No way am I putting my card on here for someone to hack. If you have your card on there you might wanna keep an eye on your bank account."

2105,45507,Telling It Like It Is,23/03/2020,Walmart,"My wife currently works at a Walmart Distribution Center and Saturday(3/21/20) when she got to work (6 am) they had a meeting as they do daily. Come 5 pm (an hour before her shift ended, they held another meeting to alert employees that on Tuesday (3/17/20) there was an employee that had contracted the Corona Virus. A lot of the employees got upset, which is understandable, and decided to go home right then. Why let your employees work an entire 12 hour shift before telling them that they were at risk? Cause Walmart only cares about their money and not their employees. They told the employees that were leaving that they could take no less than 4 days off and no more than 14 days off, just to see if they get sick or not. What kind of company does that? You would think that they would have sent out emails to their employees letting them know what happened after it happened. We're talking a whole 4 days here. I told her she is not returning at all. No company should allow their workers to work an entire shift without notifying them that they are now at risk of catching a virus that is being considered a global pandemic. Shame on Walmart. They would rather let you work and make them money before advising you of what is going on. I don't shop at Walmart, and I'm glad because they would have surely lost a customer. Also, as a side note, they are not hiring anyone to come in and disinfect there either. They told the workers to just wipe their area down with alcohol and wipes and to just continue practicing safe measures. ??? Seriously? Walmart SUCKS! There's no telling how many have it now. And they want the workers that left to keep quiet about it and they will waive points for missing work if they do so. HA! smh"

The technology used here in life-changing and revolutionary. I had so much fun shopping in the 7 minutes and 34 seconds I was in the Amazon Go store (yes, your app receipt tells you how long you were in there for). This is a perfect place to go if you're a tourist in Seattle or if you're just a local looking to get a quick bite. This place is amazing!"

So canceled my order. Will never shop there again."
2108,43497,Jenn Greindl,23/03/2021,Walmart,"Since they have started this new program where things can be ""magically"" delivered from a store after you've ordered things online to be MAILED, I have had nothing but trouble. Every order there is something that is SUPPOSED TO be delivered that same day. EVERY TIME the item hasn't shown up and I have to search it out. The people at my nearest store use the excuse that the deliverers are from an outside company and if they don't come, they have to reschedule the delivery, but unless someone calls, they don't keep track of that. Along with that, I've had these ridiculous deliveries left on my porch at 11:30 at night. Pathetic. My last product they sent to the store to deliver, isn't even carried in a Walmart store!"

2111,40768,Stella,23/03/2022,Walmart,"Walmart in Wallace, NC is a bad place to work. Discrimination is rated the highest. Level 10. Whites are known to get away with so much, and people of color is treated unfairly, talked down and treated as though they are slaves. They say they are creating a team, bull managers donâ€™t know the work, so all the work is poured on associates. People of color canâ€™t stand a chance. I have seen teamleads get away with so much, and higher management allow them to dump there crap on others. It has poor leadership and no teamwork. Poor place to work."
2112,40769,Jay,23/03/2022,Walmart,"I ordered 2 bottles of NAC food supplement for $19.73 each from Walmart.com through the vendor â€œiHerb.â€ I subsequently received an email that the order had been cancelled. â€œWe're sorry, we canceled your recent order for your protection because it was flagged by our credit and fraud team.â€ I was puzzled by this because I use this Visa card for everything and there had been no indication of any problem. I went back to the Walmart site to reorder and (surprise!) the product was now selling for $22.35 per bottle. I have been doing business with this bank for 40+ years and I have never had a problem with this credit card. It has a high limit and I pay off the balance every month. My credit rating has been in the 830-840 range for years. That they had to cancel my order due to â€œunusual account activityâ€ is complete b.s. For their highly unethical practices they have permanently lost my trust and my business."

I recently bought some items off of Walmart.com, and I received them today, but I had some damaged items and missing items in this shipment. I was not too happy with this online shopping experience! Not only that, but I emailed the customer service rep at Walmart and told him what happen. He tried to email the company where my item shipped from, but we are waiting for his response. I just hope that they send me my missing item and I will be satisfied at least. I'm just going to keep the damaged item bc I don't want to send it back and receive something else but worst."

2118,46817,Pablo Zuluaga,24/03/2019,Walmart,I see with amazement the signs posted by the chain of walmart stores of the proibision to enter with pets to their stores. only because a few customers are bothered more than anything based on their religion where pets are listed by these as sinners. I remind you that this is America with laws and credentials opposed to that of other countries. I think it is more annoying to see rude children making hashish in the stores before the indifferent look of their parents. good will be the owners of pets seek to make purchases in other stores where we resiban with our pets to not have to leave them in a car waiting for us to do our shopping respect your determination but I do not share it I think that like me there will be many people who We will be forced to change stores for our purchases

2120,45504,Rick H.,24/03/2020,Walmart,"I received an email from Walmart saying my order was processed for pickup. the problem was that I didn't order anything. I checked my charge card and saw someone bought an electronic item for $181.04. I immediately froze my charge card and a few minutes later, another charge came through for the same amount, which was blocked because of me. I tried calling that store and nobody answered in electronics, so I tried customer service...who also didn't answer. I tried this four times and with no luck, I got a hold of the pharmacy manager. I apologized for bothering him, but said nobody would answer their phone and asked if he could connect me with a manager. He said that no managers were accepting calls and that I needed to come in to the store if I wanted to talk to a manager. I told him that there's no way I was going to drive that far to come in, as this location wasn't close to my house, especially during this virus situation. I explained that this wasn't a call to see if they had toilet paper, it was because someone stole my charge card information and was trying to commit fraud. I told him this was urgent and I needed him to connect me to ANY manager right away. Again, he said no and then had the gall to hang up on me! I gave him the benefit of the doubt and called back and got a hold of him again. I told him we got disconnected and he said to me, I'm not hooking you up to a manager and hung up on me again! What an utter horrific display of customer service...the worst ever! I will never step foot in any Walmart ever again!!"
2121,36284,Li-Hsuan H.,24/03/2018,Amazon Go,"Amazing shopping experience!  As the very first store of testing this technology, I think it's fun and eye opening. The selection of the store is not as wide as a grocery store, of course for its very first attempt. However, you'll find something that catch your eyes and plus - their pricing is reasonably fair.  My favorite item, which can't be found elsewhere in downtown Seattle, was the panna cotta from Sweetaly. Amazingly good!  Their sandwiches were pretty fresh and tasty. Their prepared food had pretty good presentation; all looking fresh including fruit too.  Download their app or go with someone who has it so they can scan you in. Have fun walking around and put things you like in your bag. Then put things back if you changed your mind. Then just walk out when you are done shopping. Receipts are sent to you shortly and they are incredibly correct!  Try it out and see if you love that experience as I did!"

They get an order of 5 items and have 5 different people show up and toss them on your porch if you're lucky enough to even have your order actually delivered.

Same goes for online deliveries with them. People or the store associates just be giving you other peoples things.

THEN THEY DO NOT PICK UP THE PHONE IF YOU HAVE TO PICK UP ANY ORDERS AND WHEN YOU GO IN THE STORE YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH 3 PEOPLE BEFORE YOU FIND OUT THE PHONE IN PICK UP IS NOT WORKING AND THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT NUMBER BECAUSE OF THAT. AND THAT IS ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHERE PICK UP IS IN THE VERY FAR CORNER OF THE SUPER STORE. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE OF DEALING WITH. THE PHONE REPS ARE HELPFUL 50% OF THE TIME. AND TONIGHT I GOT A MANAGER THAT WAS NOT AT ALL HELPFUL. EVEN AFTER I TOLD HER I WAS DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM OF THEM CHARGING ME TWICE A MONTH LATER FOR THE SAME ITEM THAT WAS NOT SUPPOSE TO BE PUT THROUGH INSTEAD OF EXCELATING IT TO THE BILLING , SHE TOLD ME TO CALL BACK.

2136,47216,Tobie,25/03/2017,Walmart,Very good ideas for us!
2137,47217,Jean Pope,25/03/2017,Walmart,"UPDATE: After a complaint to the BBB, someone finally called me and made the refund happen that day. They also sent a $50 gift card. Therefore I upped a few stars for the resolution of the matter, though I still am amazed at how difficult this was for them to do. It should never have gotten to this point.  Email sent to Walmart today: *************************** Order #3091789-130070, 2 items  This is the 7th contact I am making with your company about this, the last 6 were by phone. You should see those in your logs. On FEB 7 I ordered two items from the website. I made the purchase with a $52.25 gift card that I purchased myself, and a credit card for the balance.  The items did not arrive by FEB 11 as stated on your site. I called FEB 14 and was told that the order was stuck in processing and YOUR rep advised me to cancel and reorder the items. For my trouble, you issued a $4.57 discount added back to my gift card. I was told to wait 3-5 business days for the cancellation.  On FEB 24, I called again and was told the cancellation was stuck, so the rep canceled the order AGAIN. She said wait a couple more days.  On FEB 27 I made a third call and the cancellation was still not processed. The rep assured me that THIS time it would happen in 3 business days because he lifted something in the system. ""It will definitely be done in 3 business days,"" he confidently claimed.  On MARCH 3, I made a fourth call and was told that it was still stuck, this time she was ""escalating the matter to 'Fulfillment'"", and NOW it will really happen, in 2 business days. She held me on the phone while she escalated, and said I would receive an email detailing that this was done. I never received the email. Apparently this call is not even in your logs.  On MARCH 10, I made the 5th call. This time a Supervisor (""Frankie"") emphatically said she was escalating it AGAIN, this time straight to Corporate. She told me in no uncertain terms this would take care of it once and for all, and to wait another 3 days. I did not believe her, but she gave me an incident #170310-014809.  On MARCH 17, I made the SIXTH call. They of course had no idea why it wasn't done. The supervisor (""Courtney"") said this time she was escalating the matter the correct way, and the other five people had not done it through the correct path. Apparently there are many paths, and only one of them actually works. I am laughing. She told me to give it 48 hours to take effect. Ref #: 170317-027454.  Now it is 5 days since that call, and of course nothing happened. I guess that path was not the correct one either, despite your person's adamant assurances. What kind of incompetent system are you running?  So it is now SIX WEEKS since my original order, and FIVE WEEKS since you told me to cancel that order. I have no product, and no refund. I can't file a claim with a credit card, since most of the order was paid by the gift card that I purchased myself. You have strung me along through 6 phone calls.  I am ANGRY. You did not send me a product, then failed to return the money after repeatedly telling me you would, so you are in essence holding hostage money that is NOT YOURS. I have been beyond patient, and now I am FURIOUS. Here is my advice: since you are not going to provide a normal cancellation through your infinite and equally ineffective channels, I am demanding that you place the remaining balance of my gift card ($47.68) back into that card. I know you can do this immediately, without waiting any more business days, because you put $4.57 on that card within minutes of my first call to you. I am so frustrated with this company that I will devote myself into every possible way to file a complaint, leave a review and let everyone I know how Walmart does business and that it has stolen funds. Please respond ASAP that this has been done."

2139,45500,Eldho Kuriakose,25/03/2020,Walmart,Yesterday I visited Wallmart. Actually I was scared to be there. There is no effort to sanitize the carts. Nobody to control social distancing. They should keep some sanitizer at the entrance.
2140,45501,Elliott Vantyne,25/03/2020,Walmart,"Walmart.com is the absolute worst! I was recently looking for a trampoline for my daughter so I went on the website. The store near me showed 5 in stock.so I drove to the store to find nothing in stock. I had to order it off the website which I absolutely hate doing however did it anyway. The shipping said 2 days. After 2 days I received a text that my trampoline showed up, drove to the store and come to find out that only 1 of the 2 boxes had shown up. Of course the associate knew nothing so I called walmart.com. There I was told that the second box was on a delivery truck on the way to the store and that I would get a call the next day. Ya no call. So I called walmart.com again for the second time and was told this time that my box was in a FedEx warehouse it might show up in a day or so. I was given a tracking number. Called Walmart.com for a third time and expressed what was going on. I was instructed to return my first box and just reorder the whole thing again. I had asked them to order it for me because that makes no sense and the associate told me the supplier was out of stock. I reached out to the complaint Dept and again was instructed to reorder the product myself and pay for a second one. So as frustrated as I was I went on the website and nowhere did it say they were out of stock. I had been lied to numerous times by Walmart.com. I ventured out to another Walmart for a few things and walked by 6 trampolines on the floor. Wow Walmart thanks for the terrible costumer service and horrible website"
2141,45502,Denise Goldhagen,25/03/2020,Walmart,WOW WALMART doesnt care about anyone just $$$ They r the only card thats not helping wave monthly payment or ANYTHING they dont care the biggest giant out there!! Wow its sooo disgusting walk up world there $$$$ is what makes them NOT U NOT ME MONEY the only co. during this WORLD WIDE VIRUS wow
2142,45503,Glory Hilden,25/03/2020,Walmart,Price gouging at its finest. Even my parents don't shop there anymore. You guys need to get a grip.
2143,36255,Jenny K.,25/03/2019,Amazon Go,"I'm obsessed. It's so much fun! Can there be more of these??  We stumbled inside of one (need to download Amazon Go app, link a payment card to your account, and you scan the app to enter) and had such a great experience.  Once you get inside you just grab what you want then walk out. It feels like stealing, but it's not!  The selection is the best. Grab and go items pre-packaged items from Blazing Bagels (breakfast bagel sandwiches), Molly's (sandwiches, salads), Elleno's yogurts and other local vendors (sushi, noodles and much more). Locally made chocolates and chips. Huge drink (soda, flavored water, juice) selection. All items you would need to build the perfect charcuterie plate including my favorite crackers (Beecher's), cheese (Beecher's) and a large wine selection.    There's also frozen items including ice cream!  I also saw some household items but didn't pay much attention to those - I was there for the snacks!  Service was excellent. Our toddler was running around grabbing stuff then putting it back and the employee explained that once put back it would no longer be charged to our account. And if we were we could just flag it in the account and we would be refunded. We checked our receipt and the technology is so smart that we weren't charged for any of those items. We also accidentally dropped a yogurt and they credited it to our account without us even asking.  It was such a thrill to grab stuff off the shelf then simply exit the store, and I loved how they curated a great set of local goods. We actually went back an hour later to get more goodies!  Please open more of these Amazon Go stores, and I hope this concept catches on at traditional stores."
2144,43478,Shirley Bryant-Walton,25/03/2021,Walmart,This is the biggest mess ever Walmart on Ford Rd in Canton MI only one line for 16 cash registers will never come back ever will be going to Meijer or Krogerâ€™s Walmart is not worth it I give you guys 0â­ï¸S Poor customer service
2145,43479,Alex Wilson,25/03/2021,Walmart,"Please avoid to order online!!!!! They just took the money and cancelled my order. I contacted with the customer services and they always said you will get it via your email within 24 to 72 hours, but it is nothing return and the customer services is the worst. Refused to refund the amount. It is horrible customer service and experience. I will never order online from Walmart. They took my money and I got nothing :(("
2146,43480,Nathan Yingling,25/03/2021,Walmart,I would give zero stars if possible. there is a real problem with bots buying all video game consoles released. Walmart could fix this problem by letting customers pay in advance and releasing these items to the customer instead of some jackas**making twice the amount. fu*k you Walmart for not doing your part to support the people.
2147,43481,Amanda B. Johnson,25/03/2021,Walmart,"Most of this review is about the experience of shopping Walmart's online store via their app and getting most things delivered. I switched to shopping Walmart.com after a horrendous experience with Amazon, and have been pleasantly surprised. Firstly is Walmart's sensible policy that honors gift cards on their own, without requiring that you give them a credit card number just to use your gift card. +1 Walmart, -1 Amazon.  Next is their generous returns/refund policy, which can be taken advantage of either by dropping off the package at FedEx with a QR code (my preferred method), or taking the package to the customer service counter at a physical Walmart store (beware with this option, though, as not all their employees seem to be familiar with how to perform returns bought through the online store).  Next is the product selection I've found. I didn't expect to find much on the app that wasn't already available in-store, but wow, I was wrong. They have more products available online-only than they do in the stores. Exotic products, rare products, odd and hard-to-find products shipped from far, far away. Delightful selection!  Finally, I've been happy to experience same-day home delivery of some of my orders that were available in-store. Walmart has utilized the local DoorDash-ers to bring select orders to my door the same day I placed them. (I didn't know they did this so the first time it happened, I thought the DoorDasher was making a mistake.)  All in all, positive experiences with this company's online offerings -- shopping from home with Walmart is quite a different experience from shopping inside their stores. It's like Amazon, but with better policies."
2148,43482,Ruth Goldsboro,25/03/2021,Walmart,"I have some advice for anyone who pays for something at Walmart with a credit card. If you return anything, you will not get your money refunded to your card for 2 weeks. Hope you donâ€™t need the money! I purchased something for $300 and it didnâ€™t show up on my statement for a long time that it was refunded back to me."
2149,43483,dee D,25/03/2021,Walmart,"I placed a few orders in February 2021, my delivery address is Doral Florida however after contacting Walmart when I did not receive my items, the agent tracked the package and realized USPS delivered my items to Miami Florida, they offered t o replace the items for which I am grateful. However soon after the orders were replaced my account was closed, when I contacted walmart for a reason I was told I had too many returns. I explained to them I did not have ANY returns but my orders were replaced because USPS delivered my items to MIAMI FL instead of Doral, I gave them all the order numbers and all the tracking numbers (which the agents did track) I spoke to 5 agents and 2 supervisors who were all able to see the information. They have since refused to reopen my account or accept my card. I am still waiting on a response from them."
2150,43484,Demark Bellman,25/03/2021,Walmart,One of Walmartâ€™s biggest mistakes is letting other sellers on there site sell products the sellers are greedy a box of waffle crisp made by Kelloggâ€™s is 5.34 the sellers on Walmart are selling the cereal for 40 bucks a boxâ€™s these same greedy nasty disgusting people are probably the same ones selling PS5â€™s and Xboxâ€™s at a rip off rate itâ€™s sickening to me that these disgusting nasty sick people are allowed to sell on Walmartâ€™s site Iâ€™ll never shop at Walmart again
2151,43485,Elizabeth,25/03/2021,Walmart,"Walmart will not support customers with their online purchases when they encounter bad sellers who don't support their products. Amazon and eBay will support the customer when they encounter a bad seller, Walmart does not and most of their online presence is third-party sellers. I made an unfortunate purchase from Walmart.com and the item broke in less than 30 days. When I tried to return it Walmart said I had to go through the seller. I reached out to the seller (Bingo) several times and it took them 3 weeks of being pestered before they responded. The seller's response was that it was past 30 days and they had no responsibility to correct the situation. It was only past 30 days because they delayed in responding in a timely manner. Walmart did nothing to help correct the situation."
2152,43486,Melissa Smith,25/03/2021,Walmart,"Ordered a product from their online and every day the delivery day changed to the next day. Finally decided it was never going to actually arrive so I canceled it, once on the app and it didnâ€™t seem to work, so then again on their chat and that didnâ€™t seem to work. Finally I called, got it canceled, received the email confirmation and then was told that it would take 5-10 days for me to receive my refund...... for a product that was never delivered!!! Absolutely ridiculous. Never again!! Iâ€™ll definitely be sticking with Amazon!"
2153,43487,Mikey,25/03/2021,Walmart,Online shopping has been made much worse by companies such as Shopify. The retailers can seemingly sell anything now but have no control over anything - and everyone is selling the same thing it appears. What promises a two day delivery on Walmart.ca suddenly changes to 9 days the minute you've paid for your purchase.
2154,40757,Bill Baker,25/03/2022,Walmart,Canceling for 2 reasons: 1. Walmart tries to mislead you into picking up most items from in-store. Elderly people can not understand they have to actually click a few times to un-check defaulted pick up in store. The default should be everything you put in you cart should default to delivery or shipping. You should have to change to pick up in store if that is what you want to do. 2.Automatically adding mandatory tip to you account after delivery. This is just another way Walmart tries to trick you into paying their employees even if it is door dash. Walmart needs to pay door dash or delivery person and let customer freely add on any tip they wish to give to driver. Not sure but read that the 7.00 mandatory tip (written in very light letters after the order has been placed with most customers not even seeing it) actually goes to Walmart to pay for the already paid hourly worker for pulling the items. This is just a shady dishonest way Walmart tries to scam customers out of their hard earned money. Really disgraceful.
2155,40758,Danish D'Abreau,25/03/2022,Walmart,This review is for Walmart online - My last few orders have been impressive. The most recent one - I ordered 2-day shipping and it ended up being delivered the same day - really impressive. Email sent each time to inform about delivery. Product packaged in soft ( plastic ? ) envelopes rather than boxes. Another excellent move on Walmarts behalf. Less waste and easy to get rid of. Very happy.
2156,40759,Adi Rodriguez,25/03/2022,Walmart,"Walmart steals from their customers and then pretends to not know. I tried placing a pick up in store online order and my order didnâ€™t process but I was charged twice for it. I immediately contacted Walmart. They wouldnâ€™t process my order or refund me, they kept calling them ghost orders. Itâ€™s been 2 days and they have over $60 of my money for an order I couldnâ€™t place. They only make money, off stealing from others. They will waste your time, donâ€™t allow them any of your financial information. They are hurting financially and stealing from customers. Use any service available to you, but stay away from Walmart. They plague our world"
2157,40760,K R,25/03/2022,Walmart,"Horrible customer service, cheap products, and returns take over weeks. I will never order from them again."

2159,45569,Jk,26/03/2020,Walmart,"After reading Yelp reviews about Encinitas CA Wal-Mart, I see others have had very similar experiences as my family has encountered. It's not just the clerks that don't want to be bothered, it's the supervisors in the early evening shifts as well that are out on the floor. I wonder if Ruby the onsite manager would of behaved so rudely and unresponsive if her store manager was on site. Perhaps the store manager doesnt care either and the employees sense it? Often times, the issues start at the top and trickle down. Clearly, Wal-Mart isn't taking action on all these similar negative experiences. I ask, why are the clerks acting like they hate their jobs and act as if they are miserable and ignore customers. Target employees are responsive and pleasant. Walmart take notice, be more selective on who you hire because customers take notice of sour supervisors roaming the floors and goofing off ignoring customers. Don't support and shop at Walmart. Lost another customer."
2160,36308,Yoon C.,26/03/2018,Amazon Go,"Future of shopping. Amazon is leading in every aspect of technology. I loved my experience here. First you need to download the app and login to your Amazon (you need to connect a card to your account first). As you walk in you'll need to scan the barcode shown on the app.  The store was smaller than expected but has all of the essentials for quick meals and basic groceries. The store also has good selection of alcohol    If you are in town, I would definitely check it out. It's nice to see the glimpse of the future."
2161,36360,Emily X.,26/03/2018,Amazon Go,Super cool concept! Prices seem pretty standard and they had variety of things. Definitely not a place where you go grocery shopping. I thought it was really nice that they had a small eating area that had a microwave and utensils.
2162,36315,Louanna K.,26/03/2021,Amazon Go,"Erin at Williams Floral and Gifts in Silverdale, WA made our Celebration of Life  arrangement for our Pastor Scott Pennington of the Kingston, Christian Church.

Her artistic skill and talent provided the perfect arrangement and On Time. She willingly took our request, given limited time , and was confident we would love the product. She was correct. It seems rare these days to receive excellent service along with an excellent product but Williams Floral & Gifts gave us that when they placed Erin on their staff.

2163,43471,S. R.,26/03/2021,Walmart,"Listen up to this mess and the continuing drama with my online order. When I ordered 5 things from Walmart, they split them up into separate deliveries by different companies. My pajamas are suddenly going by FedEx instead of postal.Today I get FedEx text that they delivered them. My whole order was to go to my PO Box. I go there and no package. Post Office staff looked and found nothing. FedEx says druver dropped it at door at the time post office is closed for lunch. I spoke to another FedEx lady who said they don't deliver to post office so Walmart found an home address in their computer for me and it was delivered there. How does Walmart know I still live there and didn't move since COVID-19? I found package at my door. Soooo.... NEVER EVER EVER order anything from Walmart to be delivered to you. AND.. I have only received 1 of the 5 things I ordered almost three weeks ago. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."

2166,43474,E E,26/03/2021,Walmart,"Your online grocery pick up is pretty awesome however the last few times I have been there, your associates are not wearing their masks. Ralph doesn't have one on at all and there was a large white guy with a full beard who was wearing his under his chin. This is not acceptable. Also, I have had issues returning items from this process in the store. The system tells the associate that the item isn't returnable even though it's only been a few days since I picked it up. I believe this is a system bug with online groceries orders using EBT to pay. This has been going on for months. Please install a system update to correct. Thanks!"

Also the coffee maker I received was broken and I've been waiting for a return and refund. Still waiting...."

NOT! I called walmart, they put the money back, I bought another vacuum in store, walmart then recharged for the first vaccum, and I have been in disputes with them ever since. Capital one is currently working with me on this. They have told walmart that this dispute was won by me and to take the charge off. They have not. Plus all interest fees are on my bill. walmart is a billion dollar industry, trying to take my very hard earned money. I will never shop there again. so sorry that walmart needs $150 for a vacuum I never received, so bad. It's a sad situation and this won't make much difference to them. But it is ethically wrong to not waive this fee, when the consumer for 5 months pleads that they never received product! Sheila Carter"
2172,47215,Martin Scott,27/03/2017,Walmart,Not impressed with this store as the products may be cheap but are also nasty. The more I read about low employee wages and poor healthcare coverage for them the less I want to shop here.

Unfortunately the shelves were empty of the products of toilet papers, paper towels, rubbing alcohol to make my own sanitizer, aloe vera, wet wipes, Lysol spray, napkins, toilet papers, etc etccc cans of Spam, tuna and other can goods. Is it possible to hold back some of these products for when you open at 6 a.m. for us senior citizens?????? Very very few toilets papers - probably about 10 or 20 rolls.

Please donâ€™t buy anything from Walmart. I bought an E-gift card and it was not delivered and Walmart cannot offer any proof it was delivered via email. My sisters birthday has passed and she never received her gift. I have called Walmart 8 times to no avail. They refused to give me a refund. They send me from one department to another from billing to gift card services to customer relations and customer service and they have received their money but refused to help me.
2180,40803,Linn,27/03/2022,Walmart,0 stars. They work with companies that have stolen my designs as well as my customers photos.  Handmade designs that they are machine making for a grotesque cheap price.  When I finally got in contact with them I was told to fill out a form proving the photos and designs were mine. Geez! They are doing something illegal and they're not only getting away with it but also making money from small indpendent designers. Sickening!

2182,45496,Dolores Cheatom,28/03/2020,Walmart,"I recently ordered a deep freezer online. I received the package a day earlier than expected. Due to the large size it was left in front of the building which is more of the UPS's fault than Walmart. I was able to get my package. I noticed that it had a few dents in it nothing major but I realized that this is a common occurrence with this particular product when it is purchased online. The product works perfectly and I decided to keep rather than return it because according to purchasers online who had returned it, the product still came back damaged sometimes worse. I think Walmart needs to work on how these products are being stored. I've worked in a warehouse and I'm aware of how easily products can be damaged especially if not stored or handled properly. The fact that the box had no visible damage makes me think it was damaged either at the factory or at the warehouse. It needs to be rectified especially for online consumers who have limited time and have no interest in having to actually go to the store to make an exchange or get a refund."

Called walmart as well and was giving the runaround. Demanded our money back. Never again will we do business with walmart online or anyone who uses fedex. We have also stopped shopping in store walmart as much as possible. I pray for the day walmart goes out of business. The worst retail company in the world. Screw you walmart and fed ex

2187,43462,NM,28/03/2021,Walmart,"TL;DR: Happy with the photos from their Photo Centre but their customer service gave me a headache  I've often used Walmart Photo Printing for printing my photos and I've printed hundreds of them. I've always been happy with how they've turned out and the price I've gotten them. However, recently I ordered an album for my sister living in another province in Canada and the album never arrived despite us receiving an email saying it had. We were told to call customer service, which we did, and that's when all the headaches began. My first phone call I was on hold for half an hour before my call was dropped. My second phone call I was told my call would be forwarded to someone else to deal with it, which it was. That next person told me they'd then get in contact with another person who was I guess higher up who would deal with it and that I should expect an email in a week. Over a week passed and I received no email. I called back, I was put on hold and, again, after waiting a while my call was dropped. I called back after it was dropped, quite irritated at this point, and got a kind lady who again told me she would contact this other person who would deal with it and I should expect an email in a week. I explained to her that that's what I was told last time and she told me she'd put it as a high priority. Finally, I've gotten a refund for the album but the headache was too much for all of this. I'll be trying out London Drugs Photo Centre next time, no longer Walmart."

Their reply was ""I am sorry for the trouble you have caused."" They told me to print the label and have UPS pick them up. I explained I don't have a printer, they said go to a friend's house. I have repeated told them to contact UPS and request a pick up, UPS can print their label and return their tires at their cost, not mine.

2190,43465,Joseph Bianco,28/03/2021,Walmart,Ok lets start by saying the walmart delivery service and walmart.com is trash. I spent 1400 on items. 1 of which being a TV. First they said delivery was April 1st then March 31st ok cool still a week for a delivery. So I've been tracking the shipping it had 4 updates on Wednesday March 24th and nothing since then I called Friday March 26th they said it will still be here on time ok. I check today Sunday March 28th and still no updates so I call the shipping company pilot and they still don't have my TV ok so I call walmart again and they said ohh it's a warehouse issue they are delayed cause of the manufacturer. I said how is it delayed cause of the manufacturer if your selling the item? She goes quiet issued me a huge 10% discount on the TV. Which is ok but at the rate of my inconvenience and frustration that I'm not gonna use walmart anymore for online purchases . Also my two 150 headsets were just left on my porch and not 1 knock or doorbell rung also not acceptable. Walmart better step up there delivery game cause Amazon is killing them. I get most of not all my Amazon orders in 24-48 hours usually in my mailbox or they bring the boxes to my side door so less likely to be seen and usually knock once or twice. Highly disappointed in walmarts shipping services. Do not order through walmart for delivery. Save yourself the trouble and look at bestbuy or Amazon first much better shipping practices.
2191,43466,TEE,28/03/2021,Walmart,I work at night eat at night SHOP at night. Iâ€™m not sure what COVID has to do with the hours of operation but I need my â€œWallyMartâ€ to open back up for 24hrs. I love it there but itâ€™s been a big inconvenience for us 3rd shifters.
2192,40753,Patrick,28/03/2022,Walmart,"My general experience is great but this review asked for my recent experience, so here it is- AT&T GoPhone users who live in secured apartment complexes are in for a ride. If you order one online, Walmart attaches signature requirements you did not ask for. If the carrier cannot reach you three times they say they're not going to try again, then you're stuck with a product in limbo. But i wasn't all Walmart's fault. Fed Ex had a new trainee delivery driver who FAKED the first two delivery attempts. These counted against me. When a third attempt was made by a real driver and my significant failed to respond to the intercom because the number dials her phone, I was given three strikes then told they won't be coming back, so I asked Walmart for a refund and they issued it. Two days later, Fed Ex suspended the signature requirement and delivered my phone, which was supposed to be well on its way back. What a keystone cop operation that was. Now I have a phone that is not activated, which I've told them I want to keep and they need to charge me for it, but I'm still in limbo. I hear tell once the do actually charge me I must walk it up to a Walmart to get rescanned so they can activate it. Gah! Boo Walmart, Boo Fed Ex, Boo significant other. Boo all of you. Otherwise, Walmart has been amazing!"
2193,47214,Anthony,29/03/2017,Walmart,I have used Wal Mart exclusively since they started offering two-day free shipping. I am was an Amazon Prime customer but have since stopped using them because of their political views. Wal Mart's site is easy to navigate and pay for your order. I highly recommend WalMart on line ordering.
2194,45491,Cravin Turnage,29/03/2020,Walmart,"I visited the Collierville Walmart today and was very, very pleased with a couple associates (Kathleen and Leeanna). These two ladies were very, very, helpful had beautiful spirits. As you might know, great people are tough to attract and retain. They are major assets to the Walmart as well as the human race! May continue to be propitious to them!  Cravin Turnage"
2195,45492,Shandi Moses,29/03/2020,Walmart,"If i could give you zero stars, i would. In a time like this, essential products have ridiculously high prices. Like toilet paper. I was in my local walmart today to get tp, no price listing because the prices keep changing. Outrageous prices on something that everybody needs."
2196,45493,Carleigh,29/03/2020,Walmart,The cashier told me about a rewards card but DID NOT mention it was a MasterCard. Then she double charged my visa (I had previously owned) and they would not dismiss the $285 that I already paid for. So I was forced to pay it or I would get bad credit. Walmart is slimmy and giving false information. I will NEVER go back and I will continue to give them bad reviews. In an virus outbreak they FORCED me to pay them TWICE.  Thanks Walmart. Youâ€™re really holding yourself to your high crappy standards.
2197,45494,Concerned,29/03/2020,Walmart,"Let me begin by saying that I think it is great that Walmart is limiting how much people can purchase - rationing items that are in short supply. However, the Walmart policy makes no provision for young people who are shopping for elderly parents. I went to Walmart to shop for my elderly mother and father in law as well as my own family. I tried to buy a bottle of bleach for each household and I was told one per customer. I explained politely that I was buying for two different households and the store manager said that did not matter and went on to say that the elderly immune compromised people I was buying for could come to the store themselves. We asked the Walmart Manager if we could register, we could show proof that we were buying for two households. The Manager said that they would make no provision to help. I then asked if I paid and left the store and then came back could I buy the items being rationed on my second visit and she said if she saw me in her store again today she would refuse me service. Anyway, I paid for the items they would allow me to have and then went down the street and bought the other items needed from another store. We want the elderly and especially those with health issues to stay home, but then Walmart sets up policies without any way to assist those buying for multiple households. I would expect Walmart to have a more humanitarian and rational policy in place to help people shop for multiple households. I called Walmart Corporate and they took the same hard line. In closing I support supplies being limited. In hind sight I should have had my wife go to one line to buy our stuff and I should have gone into another line to buy the items for my father and mother in law. However, that seems very dishonest, but I am sure people are doing that to get around the Walmart policy. Walmart - PLEASE CONSIDER A POLICY AND PROCESS THAT WOULD ALLOW THOSE SHOPPING FOR ELDERLY RELATIVES WITH IMMUNE COMPROMISED HEALTH SYSTEMS."
2198,36354,William G.,29/03/2018,Amazon Go,"This place deserves five stars alone for the innovation inside, but this is more about what is being sold inside.  If you're staying in Seattle, there's a good chance your hotel is nearby or a short walk away. You might contemplate drinking that $8 bottle of water or $3 can of coke, but seriously, don't do it. The prices of the food and drinks inside are reasonable, if not completely fair. I believe a large bottle of water is only $0.79, and sport drinks will be a regular $1.70ish.  Other than that, the workers are friendly and helpful if you need anything. Make sure you download the Amazon Go app before you come so you're not that person standing in front of the doors keeping everyone waiting. When we went during lunch, it was a small wait (2-3 mins), but in the evening it was pretty empty and we were able to just walk right in. I would say to come a few hours before closing if you're looking for something specific that they stock because I'm not sure how often they restock the shelves and it was quite barren in some sections 45 minutes before closing.  Lastly, it's a cool store with amazing technology. You'll probably want to take a picture or just look around, but try to be aware of other people in the store. Sometimes it's frustrating when you want to grab some drinks and a snack, but have groups of people just chatting in front of the shelves."
2199,36370,Rona H.,29/03/2018,Amazon Go,"Whenever I am a tourist in a city, I always strive to do the things that the city that I am visiting that the city exclusively offers.    (Thank-you Seattle for making me have tech envy.  I envy your grunginess yet edginess and mildly tolerable unpleasant weather.)  This Amazon Go store is offering free shopping bags (1 per customer) for possibly a limited time.  I appreciate that it is a reusable shopping bag, and it is also great marketing for them since it is bright orange.  Instead of being stuck waiting in line like any other convenient store at rush hour in a city, I was in and out the door in 5 minutes.  I think that another idea of the store is to reduce employees, but there were plenty of employees manning the doors, restocking things, and keeping things organized.    And what happens if you need a refund?"

Of course any warranty is void by alignment issues. While it is true that the car probably needs an alignment, the tires still shouldn't be nearly as worn as they are after less than 1 month(1,000miles).  ONE MONTH!  The manager at the Walmart looked at my tires, and even admitted that they shouldn't be that worn even with alignment issues, but ""unfortunately the alignment issue is going to void the warranty, and those ARE the cheapest tires we sell"" to quote him.  Of course Walmart doesn't do alignments either, but you better get one!  The Douglass tire is an amazingly shoddy product made by Goodyear exclusively for Walmart. Walmart and Goodyear should both be ashamed to produce and sell such a product"

2205,46812,Anthony,30/03/2019,Walmart,"I have been a Amazon Prime member for a long time and like there services. But I have really seen Walmart become great for ordering online at Walmart prices and have the option of paying with credit, debit, PayPal and my favorite is the reserve your order online and being able to pay instore with cash within 48 hours. I also love the convenience of shipping to my home or pickup at most Walmart stores. Walmart's 2 day shipping for free with $35.00 or more and without having to pay a yearly fee has become really great as they are concentrating on a better online experience! They usually ship via FedEx and you can rely on tracking info with email and app push alerts and great faster service. All this at everyday low Walmart prices! If you haven't tried Walmart.com lately you should, because it's gotten a lot better!"
2206,46813,Kimmy,30/03/2019,Walmart,Excellent tire service in Denver Colorado. We had gotten a flat tire nearby the Walmart at closing time. They helped us and stayed to make sure we could patch it up correctly and be on our way. Thank you. The next day we came back because we were planning to buy a full set from somewhere and they gave us the best deal on all season tires. Thanks again.
2207,45490,joe curvey,30/03/2020,Walmart,"Wallmart is one of my first choices when it comes to convenient shopping, they always have what I need and I don't have to go from store to store looking for different items when most of them are under one roof. Some times I meet new friends too."
2208,43450,Henry James,30/03/2021,Walmart,"WHAT WAS I THINKING?! Ordered two small Sony bluetooth speakers at Walmart.com... Whatever made me think I would get two brand-new speakers delivered to my home the next day free? Shopping in-store at Walmart has grown into a daytime nightmare we expect (three registers open in the entire store, no one to help you, a lot of empty unstocked shelves as the supply chain continues to break down). Received the FedEx package today. It had one speaker inside - and it was used, either someone else's returned item or a display; the package was not factory sealed and the bottom of the speaker was dirty and had abrasions. Was it the underpaid fulfillment center worker possibly deciding ""one for you, one for me"" and slipping it into their pocket in order to supplement their meager wages? We'll never know. Of course I'll never shop at Walmart.com ever again - WHAT WAS I THINKING? This review is written as a warning to those possibly thinking of trying out the online food-shopping experience. What you see in store is probably ten times better than what we don't see behind the scenes. Buyer beware."
2209,43451,Janet Whitaker,30/03/2021,Walmart,"I placed an online order with Walmart.com on February 26, 2021 for a vacuum cleaner and the amount was immediately taken from my checking account. I checked to track my order on March 8, 2021 and it stated to check back later for status update. I again checked on March 11, 2021 to see where my package was and it stated that same thing as check back latter for status update. Therefore, I spoke with a Customer Service Representative on March 11, 2021 to cancel my order. On March 12, 2021, the following day, it stated my package had been delivered. I have never received this package and have spoke with Genesis on March 19, 2021 at 9:22 a.m. and was told by her that the company stated they would refund my money back to my account for the balance of the vacuum cleaner. It has never been done. I called again on yesterday, March 30, 2021 to inquire about my refund for the vacuum cleaner. I spoke with Marianne and she said their system was down and to call back. However, I felt she was no help. At the time I ordered this vacuum cleaner, I was in dire need of it as I was ill and could not go to the store to buy one. I can say that after my conversation with Genesis on March 19, 2021, my account was refunded the 2 year service warranty as I never received this package. This is my first experience with Walmart.com and I do not plan to order online through them again. If you are able body and can go directly to a store to purchase an item, I suggest you do so and not take a chance with an online order that you may never receive."
2210,43452,Barry Burgess,30/03/2021,Walmart,"Walmart gave me a receive date of the 25th, order did not arrive received no notification as why. gave it 2 days then called the contact number for the shipper (Pilot Freight). They told me that it was delivered to the local shipping company on the 24th. Received another number to call for local shipper. They told me that it was there at their yard and that ""they would not know when they going to deliver my order because there where 9 other trucks before mine and they are in no big hurry to get it unloaded"" Actual words. Will never order from Walmart online again."
2211,43453,BR,30/03/2021,Walmart,Walmart apparently uses a third party vendor to get the item I ordered. 3 times they could not deliver and offered me a refund which I finally took. I was kept hanging on this item for 4 weeks. Finally got disgusted when I realized I would not get my order. Will not order anything from online Walmart again. The customer service folks we're nice but it was never resolved.
2212,46811,Matt Quinn,31/03/2019,Walmart,"DO NOT I repeat DO NOT order from Walmart.com. They do not honor prices they barely honor returns. They cancelled my order for no reason at all, and ive been waiting for 2 weeks. Completely ridiculous. They figure since they are so large we cannot survive without them thus they dont need to give us any real customer service. Target .com has always been top notch and service has been great, so i know it can be done. Ill only buy frim Amazon or Target from now on"

With the toilet paper fiasco of 2020 I became desperate to find some and was finally able to place an order with stinky wal-Fart. I was relieved I was able to purchase some even if I had to wait a week or more for delivery as they promised. Well, the delivery date came and went and then Wal-Fart just up and cancelled my order. Bottom line; customers wait patiently to get their order and Fart sells it out from under us. I lost time I could have used to locate real (not imaginary) toilet paper. Wal-Fart sucks. Always has. Always will. Wiping our butts on their website would serve them right."
2215,45485,Sheribaby,31/03/2020,Walmart,"Purchased a Treadmill Online. Whomever delivered it over a week ago, I believe Fed-Ex didnâ€™t have the decency to ring my bell and I was home, so it was left outside in the rain. I go outside to find a soaked box that was so soggy, it was falling apart. After opening the box, I find a damaged treadmill. I called Walmart immediately, but there was over an hour wait time. Tried their chat option, but no one responded. After a few days, someone did return my call, but in the meantime, I contacted the Treadmill company to inform them of my problem, and the Bank who issued payment to Walmart to try to find a resolution. I started a return process online with Walmart, was told it would be picked up and a freight company would call me to discuss pick up. I informed them putting it in a soggy box was not an option, and was told it was fine. Due to the Pandemic of this horrible virus, we discussed my having it left outside for pick up. I discussed this with Walmart and the freight company and we agreed that it should be left outside which I did the night before, since they were to pick up in the morning. I go outside around 10:30 am to find it was picked up. Then at 1:30 a truck comes to pick it up. I informed him it was already picked up and he stated â€œitâ€™s not the first time this happened and that Walmart must have had someone else pick it upâ€. I then call Walmart and they inform me â€œThey can not locate who picked it upâ€. Seriously? Where is it? Iâ€™ve been left on hold for hours between Walmart and their Corporate Office, And a week and 1/2 later no resolution. Walmart has been my go-to store for years, but after this experience, Iâ€™m done. The audacity to tell me to put a dispute in with my bank is ridiculous! I should be dealing directly with you, Walmart. Where is the treadmill? I cannot imagine someone walking away with a 90 pound treadmill from my home, so it had to be picked up. To wash your hands with this matter is awful!"
2216,45486,Janice Thomas,31/03/2020,Walmart,"Shame on Walmart for price gouging at a time like this ðŸ˜· When so many people are out of work and have children and aging parents to take care of : during this stage of human life , they continue to hike prices of everything from Toliet paper (which we can't get) to milk,bread, and yes even can meat !!! While people are fighting this terrible virus ,Walmart CEO and all his Toadies are raking in the dough, and for all it's worth , they pay their employees a measly 19,000 a year (that's gross salary) while they sit comfortably on their 10s of millions !!

2217,45487,Mark Petersen,31/03/2020,Walmart,"Tried the curbside delivery for the first time to avoid going inside.... BAD IDEA!! The website will not tell you but only ordering items that are dry grocery will force you to enter the store and collect your order from the ORANGE TOWER devise and lockers.

2219,43443,P.,31/03/2021,Walmart,"3 out of 3 online orders are marked as ""delivered"" but my orders are VERY wrong. Just one order for example: A quantity of ""10"" was ordered, and the delivery driver confirmed ""10"" were delivered, but the photo clearly shows ""2"" were delivered. So, there are two possibilities: 1) the delivery driver doesn't know how to confirm orders as correct or, 2) the delivery driver is stealing my orders. Either one, whether an honest mistake or not, should disqualify them from the job. This sort of thing has happened THREE TIMES IN A ROW. And my orders aren't just a little but short, they are MOSTLY short.  And....to top it off...here's the kicker...contacting customer service is USELESS. They had no idea how to help me, and/or didn't even understand the problem, and/or why I should be upset. I call the store, and no solution except a refund is offered. I don't want a refund. I don't need a refund. I need the items I ordered, and that were marked incorrectly THREE TIMES, as ""delivered.""  Here's the deal. The last time I shopped at Walmart was 2011. I wasn't happy with their service then, and my recent experience has shown me that it's gotten even worse, if that's even possible.  Additionally, my orders from walmart.com (non-grocery) are getting improperly fulfilled through their grocery delivery. I never asked for these orders to be fulfilled through grocery delivery; I expected my orders from walmart.com to be delivered the reliable way - through FedEx or UPS. But no, they had to go and ""improve"" things.  I will probably never shop at Walmart or walmart.com again. I'm cancelling them from my life, because it's been pure hassle. Hassle to get my stuff, hassle to complain about not getting my stuff. Walmart - Always a Hassle."

Within that order I had 6 boxes that needed to be returned (they were large items.) It took several minutes to explain that I needed more than one shipping label. Once we got past that barrier he asked me to wait on the line until I received the email with the 5 labels (I have 6 boxes.) I did not receive it and then he said I would get it within 24 hours! Most confusing call ever!

2223,43447,Gwen Klorer,31/03/2021,Walmart,Going to all self checkouts or online ordering. No staff to handle checkouts. Their personal shopping service online is inconsistent and terrible at substituting. Delivery is poor. Online ordering states in stock when its not.
2224,43448,Gena Ferde,31/03/2021,Walmart,"Walmart is another heartless company owned by rich plus powerful people who treat employees like peasants with poor employee ""benefits"" such as unlivable wages that make some of them rely on welfare government money. Also, shipping trucks always move very fast to bring products into Walmart's warehouse that causes broken crackers, broken cookies, etc. It's why I always buy one extra box of crackers in case of making food for parties. Cooking equipment from Walmart breaks a lot more easily than in the past decades ago. Which is why I don't buy cookware here anymore. Electronics don't last long here very much compared to many years ago. Hence, I buy some electronics elsewhere. Clothes are made with very poor quality material now in Walmart's shop versus what happened in very early 2000's. So, I try not to get clothes here. Everything about Walmart has become a joke except for its foods, some electronics, cleaning products, and a few other things. My childhood was spent happily buying electronics, foods, clothes, and other necessities here while experiencing nice employees. But, I've noticed it has changed for the worst since employees in it are treated unkindly and unfairly. Just experiencing Walmart staff behave like they are disillusioned, cynical, depressed, impatient, and other things don't impress me one bit."
2225,43449,Vicki E,31/03/2021,Walmart,Now why would the delivery guy actually bring the item up a flight of stairs even though I paid extra because it was heavy. Then I told him take it back which he refused. Then he told me that I had to talk nice to him... hmmmmmmm any men had this issue before????  I updated my rating because Walmart gave me my transport refund. However they need to look at the companies they associate with

That they are issuing me a replacement but have to wait another 10+ days for delivery from Texas to Michigan. Which from working in shipping I know the fedex hub flies direct and they can overnight one to make it right. But they say they are unable to ship it any faster. So now we are gonna be waiting almost a month for delivery. I would shop elsewhere if you want good customer service.
2229,45447,Susan Jo,13/04/2020,Walmart,"I don't shop Walmart very often, but I am using them during the pandemic to avoid going into stores. Needed a microwave. Checked their website and found a 0.7 cu ft for around $49 and later found a 1.1 cu ft for $7 more (Hamilton Beach), so that was the one I ordered. I placed the order around 4pm on Friday and it was on my porch around 10 am on Saturday. I was so impressed with the service. I don't think Amazon could do better. I'm surprised by all the bad reviews. I placed a food order for my niece who is disabled and had it shipped to Utah. I'll see if that goes well and all items received in good condition. If so, I will be a satisfied customer and will continue to use Walmart. I also am disappointed that you can't order many items online and have to go into the store such as TP and certain food items. I thought we were supposed to avoid going into the store. Doesn't sound like a safe option to me."

All the items that where ordered where available in the store. It took three days to get a curb side pick up and canceled after waiting outside for 30 minutes. I called twice to confirm the order while outside. I was told it was being picked until I received email later canceled. If I catch corona virus Walmart is responsible.
2234,36228,Mandy B.,13/04/2019,Amazon Go,"Very interesting concept, while visiting Seattle we had to stop in and see what all of the hype was about.  You basically walk in scan your Amazon Go App and pick up what you want and leave.  When you go to leave the app just knows what you picked up and charges you.  There is one person there if you have any questions but other than that you're kinda on your own.    They offer pre-made foods like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, hand and cheese, hummus and veggies, chips and crackers, etc.  pretty much anything you can get at a local convenient store."

2236,43373,MaryAnn A,13/04/2021,Walmart,"Terrible experience this past weekend at Walmart Superstore, 201 Walton Way, Cedar Park, TX 78613.  I had a return within 30 days of purchase.  The initial purchase was a request from a store associate who recommended I buy the item and return if there were any issues.  After accepting the recommendation of the associate, the product turned out to be defective - appears to be the low quality of the product.  I returned to the store and narrated the issue to customer service - was told that based on their policy, my only resort was to hold on to the item - no option for a refund or store credit.  Based on their policy, my only resort was to get a replacement and since they had none at the store, drive from one Walmart store to another till I could find one - BLATANT DISRESPECT FOR CUSTOMER'S TIME.  I finally accosted a manager onsite (Daniel, a team lead) and relayed the story to him.  He asked for the name of the store associate, which I obviously didn't have. Initially, he appeared to help me but then finally repeated the same spill from customer service - drive from store to store till I could find a replacement.  Nothing could be done onsite.  What kind of a return policy is this?  I left their product for them at the location. Now, they have the returned product as well as my money.  I'm boycotting Walmart going forward - would rather spend my money and resources at a place that values its customers.  The store manager, Michael, wasn't onsite, and I was told to get his contact info from the front of the office location, but that as well was unavailable.  Treat your customers better and improve your return policy!  There are so many alternative options to the products you sell."

2238,43375,Rick Stewart,13/04/2021,Walmart,"I hate dealing with Walmart pharmacy. There is always a line to wait to get your Rx. The techs are very slow in helping customers, and they seem to never have my basic meds like Insulin, pain meds, and glucose testing supplies. The techs have been rude in the past, it's never been a great experience. I only get these Rxâ€™s at Walmart because the insulin is so cheap. The others were accidentally sent to Walmart by the doctor."
2239,43376,Colleen Stevens,13/04/2021,Walmart,"I purchased a hoverboard for my grand daughter in September 2020. It stopped working after 2 x and would not hold a charge. When I checked the reviews on the product on Walmart.com there were 945 similar complaints regarding this product with the battery. Many people commented about the manufacturing date being years from the sell date and the battery being bad. When I went to check my product it was manufactured in 2007! Purchased in 2020! They sold me a bad device and you cant replace the battery so the unit is no good. I called walmart.com multiple times, was denied by all of the foreign customer service agent to speak to a manager and mysteriously the phone disconnected after being placed on hold for over 30 minutes. My advice! Do not purchase from Walmart. They dont stand by their customers. I had a similar experience with Amazon and they replaced the product within days. Hard lesson to learn. I am out over 100 dollars. I am placing a report with the better business office as well."
2240,43377,arayofsun32,13/04/2021,Walmart,"All I can say is PLEASE DONT ORDER ANYTHING FROM WALMART.COM. They placed a 2,000 dollar hold on my account, and said we know our system glitched but you have to wait 48 hours. When I tell you please donâ€™t waste your time because you want speak no one from the USA and you will get shitted on. Personally I pray they nasty ass go out of business."

2243,40727,Randy L,13/04/2022,Walmart,"WALMART ad on TV says that they're doing everything they can to save us money. For example, raising the price of Fiber Therapy (Methylcellulose) 500 mg (100 caplets) from $6.73 to $9.98 (with a fake full price of $14.88) overnight. The $6.73 price was a constant for years. Case closed."
2244,40728,KG,13/04/2022,Walmart,"I knew I was making a mistake calling them with a simple question. They must go out of their way to hire the dumbest imbeciles available. You can ask them the same question literally five times in a row, every time they will lie and say they understand, then they will ask something that you just got done saying, proving they weren't paying attention. You will go through this four or five times in a row, each time them saying they understand now and then asking if you tried something you just got done explaining you had done(for the fifth time). These people are seriously dumb as bricks. Their supervisor told me their website had errors because I hadn't cleared my cookies. You could tell they couldn't be bothered to even pretend to care in the least.  So here it is, five calls and an hour later, my blood pressure skyrocketed, my plans for the evening totally shot. All because Walmart goes out of their way to hire the stupidest people imaginable."
2245,47208,Sheila Kessem,14/04/2017,Walmart,the only best thing about going to walmart was when a guy asked a cashier if he works there!! that was so funny. but service is terrible. i wanted to try on a swimming suit but there was NO ONE to unlock the dressing rooms. ilooked like a total idiot walking around the store for 15!! minutes trying to find an employee who was not cashier or taking a break. had to go to fishing isle with my swimming suit to ask a person to find a person to unlock the stalls. RUDE!!!!!! very unprofessional.
2246,47115,Kerry,14/04/2018,Walmart,Walmart.com is a very good place to purchase from if you live way out in the country and do not have any shopping facilities available locally I advise anyone not to place an order on a Friday or The Weeknd. they have very good prices on 99% of their products. Only wish that all of their products where are available on walmart.com for shipment to my home they do a very good job on the shipping and packing and they're shipping carrier FedEx does a very good job also very courteous drivers and very good on time deliveries well done just please make more of your stuff available for home shipment I live in Ontonagon Michigan and we do not have any Walmart within 50 plus miles of us and you are a source of obtaining goods for me and many many of my neighbors thank you
2247,46793,Shena hill,14/04/2019,Walmart,"My daughter was coming to town. I did not have an extra bed so I bought an air mattress. She was not able to come visit so I no longer needed to air mattress.i tried to return it to Walmart store #03119. But they refused. Said there was a notice hanging up by the air mattress that said no refund. There was no notice there when I purchase it. I will tell all my friends an family to not shop that Walmart. The employees are rude an there is never a manager on duty to talk to. The people they have stocking are very unprofessional, will not get out of your way when you are trying to get something off the shelf. The return policy does not say anything bout returning air mattress."

Walmart head office requires us to order online and wait days for it to be shipped to the store even if I see the product on their shelves right now. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!! And incase Walmart is upset I have documented proof of their shortsighted and disappointing practices.
2272,43370,Karen,14/04/2021,Walmart,"For 10 months straight my online orders arrive opened, items missing, and/ or damaged. Walmart uses FedEx and FedEx is a known problem for their delivery drivers in my area lie constantly. One can go to the app Nextdoor and see volumes of complaints about the FedEx drivers lying stating that they had been by a person's home when they never came by and repeated this situation for the same order multiple times and finally after 10 days the person gets their order. I even requested that my order to be kept at a FedEx location; and the driver even lied then that no one was at the FedEx location when they went by at 2pm and the place is open to receive items until 10pm everyday. When I called and asked the facility about if FedEx came by they said no which FedEx lied again.  I told Walmart until they stop using FedEx and use a new carrier, I refuse to shop at their stores and online. Other online options and gladly pay $2 to $5 more not to have the harassment and abuse."

I spoke to 2 different women that sounded like I was speaking to China English was not good and they kept say hmm hmm When I ask a question that required an answer. I asked to speak to management she told me none were available and then put me on hold for 10 minutes. I finally hung up on her a called back and got a man who could speak English and understood my questions. Had to go through 2 people before him in China or wherever these calls go to.It was Walmarts error in shipping incorrect product but the customer has to deal with all the aggravation. NEVER AGAIN will I shop online with their incompetence in the warehouse picking orders and non english speaking people who are supposed to UNDERSTAND and correct errors. Its like talking to a wall."

Get in touch with customer service again and this time theyâ€™re like I would suggest you cancel and reorder. No there are no spots left and I donâ€™t need it tomorrow I need it today and those with a membership should take priority over other online orders.

It STILL says, ""pending return"" even though clicking on the link shows that item was returned last month and their agents acknowledged this. Still Nothing. Each agent kept telling me to wait another week, wait another week, then wait another week. But nobody took any action. Then the last obnoxious jerk I spoke to gave me a completely different story. When I told him I was going to do a credit card chargeback, he just smirked and said ""good luck."" So that is what I did. And that is how I got my refund for an item that Walmart kept for a month which they never refunded me for. I had to do a chargeback to get my refund. Save yourselves the headache and don't do business with them. Don't order from them. Stay away from them. And if they twiddle their thumbs by not refunding you, go to your credit card and do a chargeback on their ass. They are scum, their corporate staff are scum and so are their agents. They are liars and they don't care. They are not worth your business. Walmart, don't attempt to contact me to ""address these issues."" You had your chance MULTIPLE TIMES over a month. You failed epically. When I warned about resolving this externally, I was just laughed at. So don't try to even talk to me now. I just want everyone else to know what sleazebags you are and how useless your agents are as well."

2344,43354,Leo Pan,16/04/2021,Walmart,"I would give 0 start but 1 is the minimal. The experience is terrible. I saw a Kayak on Walmart.com but that is only available in one of the local warehouse in Covington. So I called the number and just want to simply check if it is still in stock. A lady picked up the call and right after I said hello and was trying to tell her why I was calling, she just cut me off and ask me to wait. Then it's been around 10 mins she came back. I told her that I wanted to check the Kayak inventory status and trying to give her details on that specific Kayak, she cut me off again and ask me to wait. Now it's already 1 hours later but I am still sitting here listening to the stupid waiting music."
2345,43355,Gary Gummow,16/04/2021,Walmart,"BUYER BEWARE! The online ad for the Mainstays 3 drawer plastic storage for $5 is just a teaser. Online it said they were in stock at my local Walmart. When I got there, there were about 20 of these on the shelves, BUT NO PRICE TAG! When I took some to the checkout, the price turned out to be about $25 instead the $5 advertised! They said that the ones I had in my cart were not the right ones, even though they matched exactly what you see online. I showed them the model # and Walmart # and asked them to look it up, and they both just gave me a blank stare. I asked if I could get some since they were supposed to be in stock and they said that there were none available! So, I then called another Walmart that also were supposed to have them in stock, and after about six long phone calls I finally get someone who told be they only have a few left. But when I told her that I would be coming from over an hour away, she changed her mind and said the $5 ones were no longer available!"

2347,43357,Tim Rowe,16/04/2021,Walmart,"Bait&Switch. I ordered 4 tires from Walmart.com. However, the tires were actually shipped from a shady company called onlinetires.com. When they arrived the tread pattern did not match up to what the picture online looked like. So, I wanted to return them. I called Walmart.com, who said Iâ€™d have to go through onlinetires.com. Which I did, even though Iâ€™d not ordered from them. Long story short, I was forced to pay $135/return shipping. Onlinetires.com refused to cover shipping telling me itâ€™s my fault that the tires werenâ€™t what Iâ€™d ordered. I spent two hours on the phone speaking with 3-4 different â€œsupervisorsâ€ all agreeing I should not be charged return shipping. Being told all kinds of stories, ranging from, Walmart.com will cover return shipping(which they didnâ€™tâ€ then I can return to the local store, which when I called the local store they refused, finally Walmart.com said theyâ€™d cover half the return shipping. Each one of the Walmart.com supervisors just made things up and lied. Onlinetires.com, theyâ€™d never budged, they didnâ€™t care I was unhappy. Beware!"
2348,43358,NICK,16/04/2021,Walmart,Walmart.com experience is like a bad 3rd world country. They don't always have things in stock and your order sometimes never ships or ships with no tracking scans. The customer service agents also have no proper training they are robotic and don't seem to care. Walmart uses FedEx Ground service which is outsourced to route owners who employ people and give them lower wages and no benefits. FedEx Express (air shipments) hires people directly and they get benefits from FedEx Express but FedEx Ground & Home Delivery is outsourced to route owners and those route owners can hire just about anyone and yes some of them open and steal packages and I've seen them toss packages at your door to save 10 seconds. I'm sure most of the FedEx Ground and Home delivery drivers are honest & good but plenty of bad apples. Fish rots from the head. Nuff said.
2349,43359,spence,16/04/2021,Walmart,It has been becoming summertime and I wanted to go ahead and get my bike in order so that I could ride I bought new tires but I found out I need a new brakes and massage to go and get some handlebars for grips for my motorcycle I looked online did a Google Search and of course many prices came up and I did see Walmart had a price range that was less than most competitors there were some that were a little bit less than them decide to go in order. * if you try and do the tracking the tracking is poor on the west side and here's a company that's a fortune 200 500 company and yet their website is lackluster the day that the Adam supposed to arrive they just tell me by the end of the day not end of business day or by 6 in the day here it is raining I'm not sure what my items going to get here I try to use the UPS tracking number which goes to FedEx and it's not even giving me details which I've never searched the tracking number on FedEx and not gotten specific details so I'm glad I was able to review read the reviews on here it's very disheartening to see that Walmart has not responded to any of them like I say mr. Walton would be rolling over in his grave if he knew what his kids have done to his company hope everybody the best in that they get some type of resolution I guarantee you I will get a resolution they will have this customer satisfied or they will have problems on their hands
2350,43360,Steve,16/04/2021,Walmart,"Just spoke with a Walmart customer service rep. who didn't have any sense of reality. I had placed a marketplace online order on April 7 to be delivered by April 19. My order was still shown as being prepared on April 14th so I emailed the seller to find out the status. They replied within 24 hours, April 15th, stating that my order was shown as cancelled in their system and I would need to contact a Walmart rep. if that was not the case. So, I did. What a waste of time! The rep. said it would arrive on the 19th. I said there was no way that was possible because it had not shipped yet. That was the whole purpose of my inquiry. He began arguing with me restating the delivery date and that he had know way of knowing when it would be tendered to the carrier. LIKE WHAT???? Never even attempted to contact the marketplace seller to find out what the issue was and get it straightened out with the seller on my behalf. Just wanted to argue with me and do nothing to help. Yeah, that's just outstanding customer service. Last time I ever buy anything online through Walmart. I'd rather pay more elsewhere and be treated with respect."
2351,47205,Patricia,17/04/2017,Walmart,"I have seen Wal-Mart change. Cleaner stores, more organized isles and brighter produce department. I comment them. Need more open cash out isles..

You can buy your groceries there too. There is also a playstation/ wii/ xobox area! You can buy summer/winter/spring things. There also is a fish area you can buy a new fishy and its house and food. There is pet food there too and beds and clothing for dogs. You can buy clothes for yourself there too. For girls there is make up products and face and skin products. If your looking for cheap and beautiful things go to Walmart!
2354,46790,Tim,17/04/2019,Walmart,"My wife and I like Walmart. They really do save you money. Now I know they're not perfect. My sister in-law has worked for them for approx 20 yrs. My brother came down with cancer while she was employed by Walmart, I've got to tell you Walmart spared NO expense at trying to save my brother. I mean in the millions of dollars over the course of about 16 yrs. They paid for everything including months at a hotel, food, flights, a caregiver everything so he could be treated at the Mayo clinic in Arizona for a stem cell transplant. Well my brother passed last year. But I'll always remember Walmart for their care and compassion they gave to my brother. Thank You Walmart for caring."

When I contacted Walmart, I had to wait 2 hours to chat with an agent ( no number to call) and the agent said that he needed to contact Ejoyous and that I needed to wait for an email response which never came. Very bad system bad supplier used by Walmart. Don't order from them. Walter M"

My other part of the order a pregnancy pillow never came and they refused to cancel the order and provide a refund. There customer service agents are stupid and hung up on me. Let's just say they are trying to be Amazon and suck at it. Still haven't got a refund and have called 4 times. Dont do it.
2360,36249,Connie A.,17/04/2018,Amazon Go,"I've been meaning to try out Amazon Go after hearing So much about it, and I'm still pretty mind blown with the technology behind how all of this is implemented. They have WiFi at the store, which allows people to download the Amazon Go app before they enter. Once you have the app opened and signed into your Amazon account, you scan your QR image and walk right through the gates. Sort of like a subway station.  It's really small inside, you literally make three turns and you've finished browning it's entirety. They offer bright orange reusable bags or paper bags where you can browse around and place things directly in your bag. The set up is relatively simple, much like a convenience store, except they have a large wall of sandwiches and ready-to-eat food, which is decently priced. Definitely convenient to come in and grab a quick snack or lunch. afterwards, you simply walk right out of the store and they send your receipt within a couple minutes.  I came here after work at 5pm, which means naturally everyone else in downtown also got off so the store itself was incredibly cramped. It's kind of amazing how the sensors work so smoothly to identify that you, and only you are the sole purchaser of the items you select, and not mistaken you to be someone else who grabbed the same thing off the shelf at the same time.  In short, technology is fascinating and I'm a grandma who needs to adapt to exciting changes coming to our world!"

The TV was canceled (Their reason was that they couldn't fulfill the order) so why would you let me order it in the first place! Then the sectional was canceled with no reason (I had to contact them to find out why) I recieved the TV mount, but the TV stand has been in transit pending for 4 days now since in made it to the final location ( I went and picked it up, because I was irritated and did not want to keep playing this game) Also for those two items that were canceled it took them 2 weeks to refund my money back into my account. Their online service is the worst I have ever dealt with and I will not ever use their online services again! Somebody needs to get their crap together or quit doing online ordering all together. I am going to stick with Amazon from now on, they know what they are doing and walmart does not. Walmart quit trying to compete with Amazon cause your on line service sucks and the rate your service is going you will just keep losing more and more people using your online ordering system!"

Instead of the dresser arriving we were delivered a 70 pound punching bag meant for a guy in Georgia when we live in Texas. We call Walmart to inform them we got someone elseâ€™s delivery and never received our dresser. Their response was that we needed to take back the 70 pound punching bag, kind of funny to expect and think a pregnant woman can do that. And then they charged us for a second dresser and told us they would not reverse the charge until the punching bag was returned. What was supposed to be a fun and exciting time was turned into very stressful."

I didn't open the package just decided I don't need the extra pillow for my chair as the chair itself was very comfortable. I bought the chair too from walmart online.  Now I didn't open the pillow or anything and the manager of the store treated me so bad saying she cannot trust if the item came like this instead of in a box. The customer next to me was an American and she was returning stuff too without a box, they took hers but for me they created a scene as I was Asian.  She finally agreed to take the merchandise, found a box for it and ship it back and stated if the third party didn't receive the package then it is on me. I left the store in tears."

Today,April 16,2022 past 3 oclock my husband and I approached the three workers were standing and talking at women's fitting area. I asked one of them if I can try the clothing that I wanted to purchase. She said she doesn't have a key and can't do anything about it. While she was saying it she was looking at her coworkers and then walks away . The other two workers did not do anything either. Please Walmart at yuca valley do something about it. Teach your staffs how to help customer's need with good manners and conduct. I noticed this kind of service most of the time at Walmart. To those three staffs today . My advice to you three, if you guys tired with your job please quit because you're stressing me out!!!"

My call log shows my arrived time on April 16, 2020 at 2:30 pm and my other 5 calls to them while waiting.

2383,45431,maryjo,18/04/2020,Walmart,"Trying to return an item is near impossible! Tried to return a few tops and their website allows you to either return to store or via mail and print the barcode or mailing label accordingly. The site let me print off a barcode to return to the store. When we get to the store with the item and appropriate barcode, the clerk wonâ€™t let us return the item(s)! They said we have to contact the seller as itâ€™s a 3rd party vendor. No where on WalMarts site did it mention this when I ordered the items. My response from the vendor? â€œIt will cost you postage to send it back so how about you keep it and either donate it or give it to someone else and we will refund you (less than) half of your purchase price!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will never purchase anything from WalMart online again, EVER!!"
2384,45432,melinda dahlsten,18/04/2020,Walmart,"I have waited over a month for orders that were placed before the pandemic hit! Then there is no way to contact Walmart about my orders. Chat line has been unresponsive and the phone states there is a hour long wait and that they will call back. I have had to make multiple calls and sometimes never hear back! Often my orders are marked as delivered or partially delivered yet, the item was not in the box! Orders are frequently cancelled and that is explainable. Okay! Today I am placing a call because they have issued a refund for a return? Huh? What return? I have waited for a double pack of vitamin C for several weeks along with other miscellaneous items that still have not all shipped out. So, they issued me only a partial refund for the vitamin C that records show neither bottle has shipped yet. How creative! Now I must spend my time trying to get back all my money for a product they probably never had in stock to begin with!"

Came from Illinois and I live in Ohio! I could have drove there numerous times and would have picked it up next day. Walmart no help at all! Gave me a confirmation that it was shipped on April 2. It wasn't shipped at all! USPS never received the item. I called them personally and USPS confirmed that shipping label was created but they have never received item. Called Walmart customer service and was told I would get a refund (which I never did)!!!! Then I emailed them about refund because you can't get ahold of their customer service by phone unless you wait hours on hold! Apparently EVERYONE is having issues with them as customer service is so backed up. 3 days after I sent email they send me some general information about returning items and cancelling order!! Are you kidding me! I already talked to someone about getting a refund and he assured me I was getting one then they send this idiotic email! Then, of all things, a few days later I get a email saying my item has shipped! It finally arrives on April 18. Apparently they don't want to issue any refunds and will make you wait weeks for your order!! Totally incompetent and uncaring! If you need your order right away, as promised!, your out of luck at Walmart! Order from anyone else but Walmart!! You have been warned!!"
2386,45434,Guest,18/04/2020,Walmart,Please be aware that each Walmart will make it about them during this time. They are not satisfying their customers during this crisis. It is all about them. I waited in line for my site to store item and never received it. I am no longer a fan of them. I have been shopping for Walmart for over a decade.
2387,45435,Robin,18/04/2020,Walmart,"This is possibly the worst company to order from online. I ordered a couple of sets of dumbbells just before the pandemic hit. They said was in stock and shipping was 2 weeks out. They never updated my shipping during this time and customer service said everything is fine. Then day of delivery, the order is delayed. Customer service says they donâ€™t have the ability to contact warehouse to find out why? What the? Why have a customer service department that does nothing different than your app? Waste of manpower. They send message to upper management. They never call me just send a email thatâ€™s itâ€™s out of stock. What the what? It was in stock when I ordered it. So are you are overselling product you donâ€™t have? Not so. It turns out during this two week wait, Walmart had been shipping multiple dumbbells to all Walmart stores instead of fulfilling orders online. I know this because through my local Walmart, I tracked the trucks coming in and picked up some of my orders myself (because I didnâ€™t trust online). So instead of fulfilling actual orders online, they decided it was more cost effective to ship to stores (BTW option to ship to store for customer unavailable). Just terrible experience from beginning to end from all levels of this company. Best example of what NOT to do with a business practice model."

I placed an order this week & everything seemed good until I got home and realized one of my items were opened & partially used. I called their lil customer ""care"" line & the guy told me I had to return the item INSIDE the store. I said uhhh we're in the midst of a global pandemic... I use grocery pickup to avoid going INSIDE the store. It was a $9 item. I said you could've emailed me a gift card or something for the inconvenience but the only solution was to take the item back to the store. Wow. Just wow. It just really left a bad taste in my mouth."

When a customer service with bad accent finally called back on Friday evening, she asked me for the order number. I was just got in, pull my expensive computer out of backpack, then dropped it, broke. She has no patience or sympathy for what happened, hung up that I have to call again for a very long time."

Double charge me for a grill I'll make sure people know exactly how you people operate how you pay for the order when you place it and then you suck that money out again for no reason.
2403,43343,Gail Lacombe Deloria,18/04/2021,Walmart,"Iâ€™m ready to boycott all Walmartâ€™s for their company policies, I used to work at Walmartâ€™s and they do miss treat their employees, lazy supervisors and managers, their never there!! And the whole company should be ashamed but their not!!! For one you give the employees a raise instead you buy back stocks (a&s ho#!s) and now you studied ceo your not giving a helping hand in voters rights, that is why you need to be boycotted!!! Go tell all the mixed races you have working for you that you do not care about their rights, their rights to vote!!! You need to stop thinking about yourselves and loading your pockets with are money, Walmartâ€™s needs to be boycotted for the harm your doing to our communityâ€™s. KARMA!! How much did you roll in on COVID a lot. What did you do for the employees that had to work with COVID? NOTHING!!!"
2404,43344,Monike Harrison,18/04/2021,Walmart,"I orded from walmart.com at noon today and I waited to receive an email to pick up my items from the West Mifflin Walmart location until 7 30 p.m. Finally I spoke with someone after several attempts of calling the pick up and delivery department. Although I had an email and order number for my purchase, the csr exclaimed that I didn't have an order showing in their system. The csr gave the 800 number for an online csr to further assist me. I called and waited 6 minutes to speak with a representative. Finally I spoke with a csr and they told me that I had an order but the Walmart store cancelled my order. I didn't receive an email or phone call about the cancellation and when I called the store they pretended not to see my order. The online CSR contacted the store about my order and I waited again for 3 minutes on hold. Walmart in West Mifflin cancelled my order b/c the items I selected were not in stock but my debit cards was still charged for $75.00!!!! Please don't ever waste your time ordering from Walmart online!! I received excellent customer service from TARGET!!!!"
2405,43346,Linda Georgia,18/04/2021,Walmart,"I went to Walmart in Gardena, on Normandie Ave. three times for an oil change... The first time in the middle of the day, was told 2.5 hr wait. Its better to come early morning. Ok so the second two times I did. On Friday at 8.30 found no one there to help me out inside or outside. I left. On Saturday went again at 8.30 am , there was 2 cars in front of me. I told him I wanted the 29.88 oil change. He told me , my car only takes the Synthetic oil. I told him no it doesn't. He argue that it did,. I have a 2007 Camry. I think I know , what kind of oils I have put in my car for 14 yrs. He didn't like my answer and told me it would be 2.5 hr wait. No matter, what time I got there it was a 2.5 hr wait. Terrible customer service ."

Logged into Fed-EX and now part is in Chicago. No help from Walmart or Fed-ex. Horrible customer service, no one could explain why? Still don't have it??? Tracking xxxxxxxx.

A few days later I get an email that order was delayed. I checked tracking. Order was in New Mexico in transit. On the 16th, I decide to cancel order. Later that day, I get email saying it was delivered. It was not. I checked my camera and at no point did Fed Ex come to my door. It was a lie. It all fairness to Wal Mart, they refunded my money when contacted. They did not have a picture of the item on my doorstep as Amazon and UPS always do. No surprise there."

I tried to give it a second chance and ordered again from Walmart I ordered about $200 worth of items and again an item from that order was supposedly delivered and I never received it so I just decided to cancel my whole order since I'm pretty sure nothing is going to be delivered. So I'm done ordering from here.

Don't buy unless you make sure it replaces for accident. Unsatisfied customer.

Can't even cancel the order because they think it has been delivered. I want my money back.
2414,45426,Suzanne Lucas,19/04/2020,Walmart,BEWARE. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM WALMART INVOLVING PPE AND THEIR VENDOR MANCRO. IT IS A SCAM FROM A CHINESE COMPANY. IT SAYS MY PACKAGE IS IN THE ROCHESTER NY POST OFFICE BUT THERE IS NO FURTHER DELIVERY INFORMATION GIVEN. CUSTOMER SERVICE AT WALMART TRIED TO BE HELPFUL BUT THEY ONLY SAID THEY WOULD EMAIL THE VENDOR. THEY GAVE ME A PHONE NUMBER FOR I THINK MANCRO 626-349-7927 WHICH IS A VOICE MAIL BUT THEN YOU CANNOT LEAVE A VOICE MAIL BECAUSE THE MAIL BOX IS FULL. I TRIED THAT 3 TIMES AND IT IS STILL FULL. IT IS A SCAM AND WALMART SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR ALLOWING A DISHONEST COMPANY LIKE MANCRO (OR OPENSKY) WHATEVER THEY ARE CALLING THEMSELVES TO BE A VENDOR OF YOURS. I WILL BE CANCELLING MY ORDER AND WOULD NEVER EVER BUY FROM WALMART AGAIN.
2415,45427,Stella R Hawley,19/04/2020,Walmart,"I had the worst experience in my entire life with customer service today at the Walmart store number 234 on Church Rd, near Liberty, Mo. I created a photo book online on April 5. I received confirmation that It would arrive on April 16th. I went to pick it up, but the clerk could not find it. I spoke to at least 3 other employees; a customer service manager, the photo lab manager, and a store manager. Not one of them could tell me where my order was at or when it would arrive. They gave me a phone number to call. When I called it, I was on hold for over an hour, only to be told that I needed to go to the store and talk to the manager to get answers. I explained I had already done that and they told me that I had to call ""you guys."" He said he was going to speak to his supervisor and he promised he would call me back in an hour. After 2 hours, I still had not heard from him, so I called back. This time I got a worker who could barely speak English. All I was able to understand was that she could not help me and I needed to go back to the store to talk to them. I went back to the store and spoke to another manager. I explained the situation to her and she stated there was nothing she could do and I needed to call ""The Number"" The problem was on their end!""She never even looked up my account, or asked for my name. What ever happened to an employee caring enough to say, ""Let me find out what the problem is!"" Everyone just passes the buck on to someone else!! I wasted the entire day trying to find out when my order will be here, or where it is. This photo album was really important and I had invested HOURS and HOURS into creating it, but not one employee cared enough to help me!!!! Customer Service does not exist at Walmart!!!!"

2423,43330,Kaytee B.,19/04/2021,Walmart,"Walmart.com is a joke. And whoever they hired to do the customer service is as well. They don't update their website, so when you go to buy something they cancel it because its not in stock. When clearly it said it on the site. So you're thinking you're getting a legit item that's not even there. Pure stupidity. What's the point of having a website If you can't even keep up with it. This is the third time this has happened. Now I have to wait 5 days for the refund which I understand is normal but is also pathetic. Never again online. Lol I'll just check other stores or wait for it to restock."
2424,43331,Michael P. Aycock,19/04/2021,Walmart,"Something fishy going on. I was already on the phone with Walmart, however, when I got done there, I contacted FedEx. So, i received a package today from FedEx, which had been relabeled due to not being able to read bar code. I wander. Correct tracking number, but wrong item. Supposed to be a headboard, and the item delivered is a small tube of clean and clear cream. Someone messed up. It needs to be made right. There's a huge difference between a small bottle of cream and a headboard. Obviously, someone needs to go back to school so they can tell the difference."
2425,43332,Kandice Selvey,19/04/2021,Walmart,Walmart has new sale tactics. Marking items clearance but not having items available and store clerks do not honor clearance tag claiming item has been sold out!
2426,43333,Carolina,19/04/2021,Walmart,"Their online grocery and â€œcustomer serviceâ€ is an awful scam. I ordered $200 worth of groceries on Saturday morning paying extra for same-day delivery. When my groceries were an hour late I called the customer service and the only thing they told me was to â€œwait until the end of the dayâ€ at which point I had to cancel my plans for the rest of the day. When on Sunday my order was still not here I reached customer service again and they told me that â€œmy order is out for delivery and should arrive within next few hoursâ€. I asked them if itâ€™s for sure going to be deliver that they and they responded yes. So I cancelled all my Sunday plans and waited a whole day for the delivery that never arrived. At this point I called the customer service once more and they said that my order was auto-cancelled (I havenâ€™t been informed about it at any point, Iâ€™ve gotten no updates or informations this whole time whatsoever). They avoided answering my question about when Iâ€™m going to receive the refund - I still donâ€™t know and still havenâ€™t received it. Besides that they werenâ€™t able to answer any of my questions like â€œwhy did it happenâ€. Ridiculous parody of a â€œserviceâ€."
2427,43334,M Lochridge,19/04/2021,Walmart,"Don't bother with Walmart+ program. 2 of 3 orders cancelled within an HOUR of delivery / pick up time. When I phoned after receiving text cancelling yet another order (45 minutes) before set delivery, phone representative told me order was picked up by driver (???? HOT CAR 1 HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE SET DELIVERY????). Three text were received cancelling order before I could even get someone on phone to question why. I met my end of the agreement, I paid the $98.00 for annual plan, yet Walmart did not met their obligations two out of three times. That was enough for me to insist a FULL REFUND. Hey I tried!"
2428,43335,Ralph Franks,19/04/2021,Walmart,"Ordered an item online. Walmart took my money and did NOTHING for a few weeks. So far I've spent three occasions trying to find out what happened. The people in support only have the ability to relay information you already have access to, so they are useless. Their supervisors, the same. The excuse I was given was ""due to high order volumes, we were not able to deliver the item in time"", which is laughable. They didn't even PROCESS the order. I won't ever do online business with Walmart again and I suggest no one else does either."
2429,43336,Bidensapedo Whereshunter,19/04/2021,Walmart,Lets face it. Walmart was horrible before the democrats colluded with china to cause a distraction to sway and cheat on the election. They have been in bed with china for serveral years. Buying cheap junk made by children in Chinese sweat shops. Now Walmart acts like they don't appreciate its clueless customers. You can call any Walmart store across the nation and 90 percent of the time nobody in the dept you need will answer. I was looking for a new riding mower. I called the randleman NC store. The asheboro NC store. Numerous times. Randleman nc is the worst Walmart in north Carolina. I went to Lowes and bought a new John Deere s130 and paid 2245.93 cash for my mower. If Walmart don't need me. I dang sure don't need them. My John Deere was built in Greenville tenn. Lowes is a Salisbury nc based company. Screw Walmart. Chinese junk pushers

Walmart should make managers accountable for this but they two are lazy they hide behind doors and will not even come out when a customer has a complaint."

2434,46786,koffee247,20/04/2019,Walmart,"I buy from Walmart because they are close and usually have the best prices. HOWEVER -- for the past 3 years, there is always at least one items I need that is out of stock on every trip. They are constantly restocking, crowding the isles with boxes, but either they quit carrying the item (example: fire logs in March when it is still chilly in the midwest and people use them year round for campfires.) or it's still in the back. I have been told that when an item sells out it is automatically reordered. So why couldn't I purchase a specific, very popular flavor of Gatorade or any brand of meat tenderizer for weeks? Who knows. Also, the store is very disorganized and dirty. Chicken bones left in the clothing, trash in the shopping carts, on the floor, in the parking lot. Items not where they should be. And, then there's the rude employees -- must not like working there. The handicapped carts are rarely available because they are broken, not charged or being played with by children whose parent don't seem to care. I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea."

Yesterday I went to the same store to get more but the lady behind the counter said that they aren't selling perfume in stores anymore, and that I have to buy it online. I went online and low and behold they now want $14 more for it. My question is this 1. If you have never tried it before, how do you know you will like it. Some perfumes smell different on everybody. 2. If I want to shop online, I will but, I refuse to let some 2nd rate store ram it down my throat. 3. How do they get away with jacking up the price by $14. Isn't that called PRICE GOUGING?"

Meanwhile I was charged for over $ 100 and no merchandise â€¦.generic answer and not assistance.

I returned the first one and reordered the 2nd one and received the exact same one i returned. It was a completely different style and color i wanted with different numbers and names for them. I am highly disappointed with this order and i decided to give up and keep the 2nd incorrect one. I don't even know if they are compatible with the price. I ordered WB401 Dakota in blue with a bumper in front And received (twice): WB402 Cameron in black with no bumper in front  Thinking i am going to start shopping at Target for everything i need or want. Very agitated with this recent order.

I contacted customer service explained what happened. The service attendant checked the order said he would send out another pair of jeans immediately. I was initially pretty pleased until I received my new order confirmation showing that I was charged for that order. Two pair of jeans for the price of three - not a very good deal.
2447,36279,Megan L.,20/04/2018,Amazon Go,"I'm all for this futuristic, new way of shopping! Whether you're visiting or living in Seattle, Amazon Go is something you need to experience.  How it Works: 1. Download the Amazon Go app. Sign in and register a credit card. 2. Open the app and scan your phone before entering. If you're coming with people who don't have the app, scan your phone and let them enter first before scanning yourself. 3. Pick up a free reusable bag (while supplies last)! 4. Shop away! Once you grab something, it'll automatically be added to your cart. If you put it back, it'll be removed. 5. Just walk out when you're done! Your receipt will show up on the app moments later.  It'll definitely feel weird just walking out when you're done, but I'm all for it! No more waiting in long lines, dealing with bugs on self-scanners, carrying your wallet, talking to cashiers, or collecting piles of unwanted paper receipts!  It's pretty amazing how their cameras can accurately identify their customers and automatically add/remove whatever you grab or put back on the shelves. I was a bit hesitant to touch and put back all of the items for fear that they wouldn't be removed from my cart, but my friends grabbed and put back several items and had accurate receipts.  Remember that this is a convenience store and not a full-on grocery store, so don't expect much in terms of variety. I can't vouch for the pre-made food, as I only purchased small items like gum and water. However, my friends each got two different types of pre-made sandwiches and said they were pretty good. We also noticed that their prices were very affordable, at least compared to the prices we're used to in California!  Tip: There's a small bar seating area to the side where you can sit and eat your food, grab utensils/condiments, microwave your food, and charge your electronics!  TLDR: Amazon Go is totally worth checking out, and it's a cool glimpse into what the future of shopping will be one day."

2449,43323,Raymond Montgomery,20/04/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a microwave from walmart.com thur a company called 4wheels. It is for an rv and was advertised with trim kit. They sent the microwave without trim kit. When I called Walmart they had 4wheels respond. 4wheels response was sorry but that price is microwave only. We will take that down that ad. A day later still up 3 dollars more. I screen shot that and sent to them asking for my trim kit. 4wheels today has the microwave at about 30 higher now. Walmart says they can do nothing but stop allowing them to sell on Walmart.com. They are still advertising, so buyers beware. 4wheels is a rip off company. They advertise at one price and send you something different. I call this bait and switch. So far they have done nothing to fix this issue and I don't trust them or doing business with walmart.com."

She went and got him a cart and handed it to him. When I told her the same thing she said ( get it yourself. when I asked her name she turned away and refused to give me her name. By not providing equal service to everyone on equal bases she discriminated against me, I told the manager and brought him to the front to see who it was but she ran out so she could not been seen.

2459,40723,Gaylene Layton,20/04/2022,Walmart,"I am constantly getting emails from Walmart to do a survey of their app.. i bitched so many times, taken their surveys and they just don't give a damn what customers say, or what complaints we have. The Walmart App is the absolute worst since they changed it.. a couple years ago. Why do i want the list of groceries i bought?? I DON'T! When i go to the app, i want online purchases I've made... How do i find just my online purchases?. I hate companies that want you to take the time to do their survey and feedback, but yet they don't give a damn about your complaint.. they really don't. Walmart has to be the worst for this.. Please fix the app, take a minute to show you TRUELY care what customers are telling you when you ask for app feedback. I just want to pull up the app and have it show""online orders""."
2460,45404,Kelly Montifiori,21/04/2020,Walmart,"Walmart Erie Pa doesnâ€™t think they need to comply with the Governors mandatory mask in public. While every business is complying with this, Target included, Walmart feels they are above the law!!! I called the corporate office and they told me they canâ€™t make anyone do anything. I called the Health Department and this is NOT the first complaint. They informed me that Walmart hasnâ€™t complied since this started and to not shop there."
2461,45405,Meagan Harper,21/04/2020,Walmart,Fake. All the stuff that they seem to be doing fake. They let people in without masks yet they are mandatory when going outside. Like 10 people every isle. Shouldn't have been that many inside. They dont care.
2462,45406,Sue Grzyb,21/04/2020,Walmart,Ordered cat food & treats from Walmart.com. Why would it take 3 weeks to get pet food??? I should have gone out in the virus to get my babys food & treats!!! NEVER AGAIN
2463,45407,Luigie,21/04/2020,Walmart,"Ordered a 55 in samsung tv last saturday. Supposed to pick up the item to walmart store by my house the next day. Woke up sunday morning with a text from walmart saying my order was cancelled due to high demands. Ok i got that, but where is my money that is $371 they charged me on my bank account the moment i placed the order? Until now i am waiting for them to return the money back into my account!"
2464,45408,Dee Carey,21/04/2020,Walmart,"I was on hold for 3 1/2 hours and they started giving me a timeframe. Wait time is more than 1 hour..3 hours later..your wait time is approximately 23 mins, to 17 mins, to 3 mins, to less than 1 min. Tell me why it went back to more than 1 hour. That's just not right."
2465,45409,Bully Killer,21/04/2020,Walmart,Walmart.com chewy.com and all places that you have to do stuff online because of the virus you guys screwed up and now I'm $113 in the hole from my SSI card I had to order something online and you guys took five whole days to take the money out instead of immediately now all the sudden you want to take your money out five more days later and I'm in the hole because apparently with everything that is going on online ordering is really slow you guys need to make this crap right immediately I've had this card forever and because I can't get to the store I have to order my cat litter online it took two and a half weeks for for small thing the cat litter to come to my apartment that is a ridiculous amount of time. when you order stuff online instead of waiting until it shipped which it should be immediately especially if I pay extra for it expedited shipping you need to fix this and you need to fix it immediately please because there is no excuse just because the virus is going on
2466,43320,Toya,21/04/2021,Walmart,"Customer service is horrible. Javier, Gabriel and Bilal are unhelpful. Tv came broken and replacement was not sent. The rep canceled my order without my permission when I requested a supervisor."
2467,43321,Clement Bourg,21/04/2021,Walmart,"Multinational billion dollar company doesnâ€™t understand inventory control! Or is it they think theyâ€™re too big to fail so they really donâ€™t care about customer service? Their customer service reps certainly donâ€™t care about service! 3rd time I purchased a large item while listed as in stock only for the order to be canceled due to not in stock. I contacted so called customer service 3 times within the 15 day preparing your order time frame only to be guaranteed that the order will ship for it to be ultimately canceled. I have screenshots of our conversations. So no, they didnâ€™t check with the warehouse like they said they did. They just flat out lied. Iâ€™m already boycotting Amazon for similar customer service issues, time to add Walmart to the list. I hope others finally see the light and put this monstrosity out of business!"
2468,43322,Cory Montague,21/04/2021,Walmart,"Walmart Plus is only good on paper. No 15 day trial, no cancel will be excepted. Shipping goes right to hell after they have your plus money. 2 days turns in to 7 days, This is the worst shopping program I have ever seen. Please avoid it or your stuck with it for a year of bad service.."
2469,40719,Heli Bagadia,21/04/2022,Walmart,Worst customer service ever they give wrong size and holding your money. They dont even pick up the return. I am calling them every day . They are not doing any thing.
2470,46785,Audelis Martinez,22/04/2019,Walmart,"Walmart Store Management/ April 21, 2019 We had a bad experience as customers in Walmart Center at Gibsonton dr in Florida. We do most of our shopping at Walmart. Yes, Walmart is known for been open 24 hours and having the lowest prices and also for price matching. Let me go back to the beginning. We when to Walmart to buy some groceries including my Son getting new Sox and tennis shoes for the gym. My daughter is also looking at getting a Mountain bike so we could go hiking and trail riding here in Florida. We are moving to a new house and we want to get shower rods for both bathroom and shower curtain. In the middle of this/ we decided to buy a new vacuum that could do both tiles and carpet. Are old vacuum only does carpet. My in-laws just got this new shark vacuum and it works great. At that moment we decided (Letâ€™s get a shark vacuum) well we look and found the one we wanted. Unfortunately the boxes of inventory for that particular vacuum where out. We noticed they had another vacuum for $200/ the same price range of the one we where looking at buying. So we When on to pay for everything we needed. This is where the customer service When very wrong and impolite. At the register we explained to the lady at the self paying aisle. This vacuum (Shark Rotation Lift away) that is normally $279 plus tax is mark down at $199 plus tax. Can you please adjust the price. She When to talk to another register/ the manager came about and said/ this is the original price. We told Him... is mark down. In reality we where not looking at getting this vacuum/ but the one we wanted was NOT in stock. Well he said I could check for you to see if we have any more in our wear house. We insist/ We have a picture of the label. Your sample vacuum is above the boxes we pick and the label clearly stated that is mark down in price. He explained that it was their error/ someone had forgotten to remove the label of a sale they had the week before. I said/ How is this our fouls? Whether it was us or the next person/ the vacuum was labeled at $199. At this point we where very disappointment with the treatment we got by the lady in the cash register and the unpleasant manager. We are NOT stilling merchandise. We are regular customers/ buying at Walmart on a daily basis. Walmart Employees should NOT think everyone who walks to their cashier is looking to take advantage of the situation. Explain to me how is it our fouls that they forget to remove a price tag from the weekend before. I will never give them my business. I will purchase on line or Amazon but will NEVER buy at their location again."
2471,36372,Mad M.,22/04/2018,Amazon Go,Strange experience. Scan in yourself and your guest. They track your movements in  the store and products you remove from shelf. As you exit scanners overhead confirm what you took and charge your account. 5-10 mins later you get your receipt. Very fast and convenient.
2472,75703,diamondhandzbaby,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,"who said it was or wasnâ€™t easy? reading isnâ€™t hard, this amazon shop is EASIER and more convenient, grocery stores u have to deal w slow workers,"
2473,75704,diamondhandzbaby,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,"closed lanes, long lines etc"
2474,75705,RisaPieces,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,You said it was easier which means something has to be harder bro itâ€™s literate comprehension
2475,75706,diamondhandzbaby,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,i donâ€™t wanna do it online? if ur saying iâ€™m a bad person for not wanting to have cashiers then why would u suggest i go online shopping? then more
2476,75707,diamondhandzbaby,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,"jobs are lost, no janitors, no security, etc"
2477,75708,RisaPieces,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,Whatâ€™s good and â€œeasierâ€ about that
2478,75709,RisaPieces,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,I literally donâ€™t understand where you stand with this
2479,75710,diamondhandzbaby,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,"cuz u responded to a partial part of my argument probably, my stance is i would prefer this cuz itâ€™s easy, no cashiers no lines etc"
2480,75711,diamondhandzbaby,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,u said that makes me basically a bad person that lacks empathy cuz of the workers not being needed but then suggested i shop online
2481,75712,RisaPieces,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,Most grocery stores cashiers and other workers are the janitors you literally donâ€™t have grocery store having their own security unless -
2482,75730,scarlett,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,"they still need workers for restocking yes, but less workers bc thereâ€™s no checkouts"
2483,76105,RisaPieces,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,Bro the average chain grocery store has at least 100 up employees thatâ€™s 100 families going without a breadwinner
2484,76106,RisaPieces,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,How is handing your items for someone to pack your bags properly for you not easy?
2485,76107,RisaPieces,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,Bro really canâ€™t wait in line the to help keep jobs open the actual privilege and lack of empathy. You can literally grocery shop onlineðŸ˜¬
2486,76108,diamondhandzbaby,22/04/2021,Amazon Go,"except thatâ€™d be even worse because then no janitors get paid, no security etc cuz thereâ€™s no need for them at all now"
2487,43314,paul Skidmore,22/04/2021,Walmart,"Ok .....so were do I start? Almost 3 weeks ago I got an alert on my phone letting me know that Walmart had gpu for sale at MSRP. and after 4 months of looking and searching I was so ecstatic that I finally found one through a vendor called Veveo and to my surprise I got the order in before it sold out . Now any one that has been looking for a graphics card know how hard its been and how frustrating it is trying to get a card for your computer considering all the bit coin miners and bots buying up all the gpu in seconds, and after 4 months I thought the search was FINALY OVER!!........ Or was it ... For 2 weeks the order stayed in preparing order stating the tracking will be available soon. It was to be delivered on the 13th of April, and even Walmart swore up and down DONT WORRY REST ASSURED IT IS COMING!!! Then in my e mail after almost 3 weeks of frantic waiting I received a message after sending 3 Emails receiving no responses SRY WERE SOLD OUT THE IDEM WE SOLD YOU IS NOW ON BACK ORDER WE ARE REFUNDING YOU TODAY AT 9PM. {still haven't received the money} so basically the sold me a product they didn't even have , causing me not only anxiety and mental stress, but also depression . I honestly feel like I was cheated cause the idem is still up on Walmart stating it is coming and just for curiosity I decided to call Walmart to confirm yet again the statics of the order .... and low and behold the same response { From Mohammed @ Walmart CS} DONT WORRY REST ASSURED IT IS COMING!!! So in hindsight its a breakdown in communication and I wish things could of been better handled, like oh I don't know ,,,,, don't sell things you don't have to people and leave them hanging for 3 weeks , And defiantly do not send them an Email the day of telling them they are S.O.L . I understand that things in life happen and you can't control the world ... I get that . but this was a ball drop if i ever seen one. I am leaving one star just for the fact that the idem was sole under M.S.R.P and not at scalper prices . for that I give credit, but honestly the company { or company's} should make this right and find the same card I purchased and ship it to me honoring the original purchase agreement. If this is or some thing similar is done I will change my review but at this time in my opinion is, buying from this vendor is a 50/50 risk just be prepared you may or may not receive you order that was processed even know you received a verification e mail .Now lets see how long it takes to either recive the card that was promised or the refund...."
2488,43315,Michelle Murray,22/04/2021,Walmart,"I attempted to order a canapy wall from Walmart.com. they shipped to wrong address. I called the day it was supposed to arrive and they were supposed to re,ship it. They again shipped it to the wrong address. I called a 3rd time to have them correct address and reship. This time they said they can't update my address and refused to resend it. So I had to cancel the order and go somewhere else. I do not reccomend using walmart.com. they are incompetent."
2489,43316,Tracy Borchers,22/04/2021,Walmart,"Iâ€™ve not ordered groceries from Walmart, but I order household and personal supplies frequently. Their delivery people are the worst. Iâ€™ve had packages left everywhere except my front door. One was left on top of my mailbox on the street. One was left in a flowerbed. One was left on porch steps and one was left next to our car. How difficult can it really be to place the package at our front door? Amazon, UPS and USPS have figured it out. Besides the bizarre delivery locations, the delivery people sometimes walk across our yard and jump off our garden wall to get to the street, so rude! Iâ€™ve tried calling the Walmart location the deliveries are coming from and they donâ€™t answer the phones. Itâ€™s sad these people have no pride in their work."
2490,43317,Anonymous,22/04/2021,Walmart,"On March 11th at around 12:50pm I was driving west on Derry from Mississauga. I was near the intersection of Derry & Winston Churchill in the left hand lane. To my right was a Walmart truck driver also going straight. He made eye contact with me as he was ahead of me and he was checking his blind spot which was when he saw me. Regardless, he decided to make a very sharp lane change forcing me to move to my left and into the turning lane or he would have hit me dead on. I had no time to check to my left and to ensure I was safe to go over and if a car had been there, we would have gotten into a 3 car collision. I was able to get back over and continue straight on Derry. I was very shaken up and confused as to what had just happened. The driver of the truck slowed down and somehow then got behind me and began to tailgate me until we got to the next set of lights which at that point, he passed me again and drove into the left hand lane and made a sharp left and went on to drive south. He was clearly trying to cause an accident or he was maybe under the influence of some sorts. I managed to get a picture of his truck and his license plate. The genteman was in his early 30's perhaps, dark skin and wearing a mask. I have filed a police report with the Halton Police and also ""attempted"" to reach out to escalate to Walmart. I have been chasing them since the event which was 5 weeks ago & not a single person has given an ounce of care to deal with me. Every time I call in, I am placed on hold and then get told I will be transferred to the ""right department"". From there, I get transferred to a dead number or the number continues to ring with nobody answering. I have been told my matter has been escalated to the transportation department, the President's Group and that I will get a call back. As noted, it's been 5 weeks. The entire system is corrupt and they have done this intentionally so nobody can get in. When you email them, they refer you to the same phone number and when you call them, they tell you to email them. Shame on you Walmart and for the countless employees I have spoken with who again, could not care less to speak with me, take down my information, own it and let me know that the proper course of action has been taken to address the driver of that truck on that day. Imagine I had my children in the car or there had been a horrible accident caused by his carelessness causing me injury or even death. Shame on the entire company for having absolutely zero morals!!!  Truck lice plate was AV G0472 and the Walmart truck number was 766354"
2491,43318,Erika,22/04/2021,Walmart,I wish i can give zero stars Walmart online is a rip off i ordered a bike and in ita place they send me a 5 dollar lotion so then i contact customer service they said that they cant send the bike because its out of stock false advertisement seriously if u knew that it be out of stock to replace the one i order never again i will not by from walmart online
2492,43319,Unhappy person,22/04/2021,Walmart,"My Highland, Ca. Location has the worst employees. Have never been to a store with such rude people. Its just a job and only care about the paycheck, but if your that unhappy do us a favor and stay home or find another job. I have witnessed employees being jerks to customers and with a manager witnessing it and not doing anything about it. I try and not go to this location but if I gave to I only go to self checkout just so I don't have to deal with their employees. Its pretty awful."
2493,40718,Kate Reznikov,22/04/2022,Walmart,"I bought from them bowls and plates. Order 3752216-509228 Looked good on the picture, nothing even closed to it in real life. Ugly, heavy and horrible color of something unwashed. No one would want to have such a thing on their table. Good thing that I didn't open the whole thing, just one plate to see what it looks like. Of course, it went right back. But now I have to wait 10 business days to get my money back. The important detail is that you CAN'T write an honest review right there, in Walmart. That's how they deceive you. Very upsetting!"
2494,47204,April Piccirillo,23/04/2017,Walmart,"No doubt, under one roof, the variety supercedes any other super store. Service has improved. Quality of produce...average. Price of produce; ridiculously high. Non-perishable foods (canned or boxed, etc), not near Aldi quality or price! Have shopped 53rd Ave, Bradenton, FL store on two separate occasions when entire fridge or freezers went out and foods unavailable. No rain checks, offered for inconvenience, nor front door signage of apology to consumer. Sometimes get the feeling that they are bigger than everybody else, so just deal with it. Recently, shopped for a bunk size mattress and spent 30 minutes seeking service to finally find a helpful cash register attendant to call for assistance to stay with me until satisfied to which I was extremely grateful. PS. Your 'Clearance Aisles' are deceptive. Prices not marked down at all and if so, by pennies!"
2495,46784,Vinny Loseay,23/04/2019,Walmart,I love Walmart the service is great! And the employees are very helpful Iâ€™m definitely a big fan !
2496,45403,PK Murphy,23/04/2020,Walmart,"A Walmart Toronto grocery order, due 3:00 to 4:00 pm, Monday, 20 April 2020, in the amount of $150.42 never arrived. Walmart does not respond to emails, can't get through by phone, no way to know exactly what firm or person is supposed to have delivered it.  I'm 75 years old, self-isolating as old people are advised to do. I can ill-afford the loss of the $150.42, which, of course, Walmart charged to my credit card as soon as the order was ""picked."""
2497,43310,Cathy Wrobel,23/04/2021,Walmart,"While my items arrived in a timely manner, the way they were left was unacceptable. This is the ONLY company that leaves my packages out on the front steps instead of putting them on my front porch. I guess they want to make it easier for the thieves to grab things as they walk by!"
2498,43311,Dee Bowden,23/04/2021,Walmart,"On April 19 I ordered a couple of small items for curb-side pickup from the Walmart on Marketplace Dr in Garland, TX. I have never had very good customer service at Walmart... seems like I was an inconvenience to the staff. This trip, however, was unlike anything I had ever experience at any Walmart. Before I could even call the number to let them know I had arrived, Kimberly approached my car to get my information in a very courteous manner. She immediately fetched my merchandise and was professional and friendly. Walmart needs to hire more employees with her demeanor and confidence."
2499,43312,lilo by,23/04/2021,Walmart,"I ordered from the Walmart internet, I PAID $119.99 to Walmart for a laptop computer the Acer C720-2844 (NX.SHEAA.004) Chromebook. The laptop was packaged up & sent to me with a damaged power cord, making it defective & unusable. Due to Walmart's egregious, deceptive practice of using an unreliable 3rd vendor corruptly & conveinantly based in New Jersey so that they may take NO responsibility. The actions of their vendor 'The Main Guy' was either careless or deliberate & his action cost me $20.00 more dollars to return the not working laptop I purchase through Walmart. Walmart Customer service then sent an email saying they would have sent me a return label. However this is a lie. I made 3 separate phone calls to Walmart customer service. The 3rd one told me I was NOT eligible for a return label due their use of a 3rd party vendor. Next, the vendor, The Main Guy sends me an email instructing me to go to Paypal, pay an additional fee to get my refund. Why? Walmart took my money via my debit card. Why is Walmart NOT refunding me through the method I used? Why did they refuse to send to send me a return mailing label?"
2500,43313,Juan Lloyd,23/04/2021,Walmart,"We were having trouble using Shipt through another store so we thought we would try Walmart. Big Mistake. Besides making you order a day early our order, at this point is 3 hours late. All of the fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables we ordered that were available on the website are not available. We have tried to call the store but they only department that will answer the phone is the pharmacy and they won't call anyone outside of that department or transfer your call. Waste of time shopping at Walmart."
2501,40715,Greg Cox,23/04/2022,Walmart,"Worst I.T. dept in history along with their offshore customer service who aren't worth a sh_t. Order online and a hour or two later it gets canceled because of no stock, but at the time of order they listed several in stock. Walmart deserves all the jokes. They are crap."

2503,40717,Tinker McLain,23/04/2022,Walmart,"The Walmart in Biddeford, Maine doesn't allow overnight parking. Not a problem. The way security handles it is. They come out and take pictures of your vehicle while saying nothing unless confronted, and then they are very rude"

2505,45399,P-,24/04/2020,Walmart,"I ordered a canopy tent and patiently waited for over a month due to the pandemic for it to be delivered (for in-store pickup). After over a month, I decided to contact them.  The individual on the phone told me he would issue a refund and I could order another one. I replied that the price had increased.  He suggested that I call in to have the difference refunded once my 2nd order was placed.  I proceeded to order a 2nd one while he processed the refund on my first order while I was on hold. Well, this threw him for a curve and suddenly he couldn't refund the difference after all.  He said he wouldn't be able to see my order for 24 hours and that I'd need to speak to a supervisor when I call back. I told him I'd like to speak to a supervisor now in that case.  I'm on hold and the time-on-call is currently 45 minutes.  This individual clearly just put me in purgatory because he didn't want to escalate.  So, this review is for you unnamed support rep."
2506,45400,Bri H.,24/04/2020,Walmart,I spent over 200 dollars at walmart 2 weeks ago and asked for 20 cash back. When I got home I realized it wasn't given to me. I called immediately but couldn't get through bc the phone kept ringing and I kept calling all that day. I kept calling the next day and not only did the phone keep ringing but when I finally got transferred I was put on a long hold again just to be hung up on twice. I called customer service line and they had someone reach out 4 days later just for them say the have to look at the cameras. Its been 2 weeks now I don't have MY 20 dollars or even an update. The store is far from me and I've been in the house during the pandemic. I don't want to go anywhere I don't hv to. Target is 5 min away. I'll go there next time I need something for sure.

So disappointed... and inconvenient to return! Now I have to go to the store to return it..... my FIRST and LAST time using walmart.com.... RIDICULOUS just like the store."
2508,45402,Jessica GarcÃ­a,24/04/2020,Walmart,"Made an online order. Last update is that it was shipped from Rochester, NY since April 7 and has never arrived. I've been tracking the order on the Walmart app and it's still showing ship. Today is my third day calling customer service and no one has answered. It's a Big shame that a huge company doesnt prioritize their customer needs. Ohhhhhhh I haven't received the items, but Walmart did charge me the $92 00. :-("
2509,36291,Amy L.,24/04/2018,Amazon Go,"The future is here.  The space is on the small side but it doesn't matter because Go is designed to get you in and out quickly. There are some very nice Amazon employees on hand to help you if you have any questions.  You can scan your friends in with you if they don't have the Go App on their phones but be aware that anything they walk out with will come off your account.  There are snacks, alcohol, make-at-home meal kits, convenience foods - salads, pasta salads, sandwiches galore, etc. - but everything feels just a little more upscale. Way more Whole Foods than 7-11.  I got a burrata sandwich, which came on good crusty bread with balsamic, roasted red peppers, and very generous globes of burrata. 10/10 sandwich. It didn't have that stale convenience store cold case flavor but had plenty of that delicious convenience store texture - you know, that thing where the ingredients have been friends long enough for the flavors to marry but not so long that they've become enmeshed and forgotten they're individuals.  They have a great selection of hawt new products! I got a can of Spindrift made with only seltzer and fruit juice. La Croix, who? Though they do have La Croix in individual cans and full cases.  You won't be able to get $1 Tornadoes or giant slurpees here but lunch still clocks in at under $10. Most of the sandwiches are $5-8 and there are some seriously good deals, too! An 8.5oz box of Maldon salt is $6.99, exactly what it costs on Amazon Fresh.  Money and time well-spent!  On your way out, there is a little area with bins of condiments, napkins, etc. so you can grab some and go to the adjacent green area or dog park to enjoy the sun!"
2510,43307,Pat,24/04/2021,Walmart,"I ordered online from walmart.com a printer, a Hewlett-Packard printer. Not knowing at the time that they were dealing with another company that they received the printer from and selling it I guess as the lady quoted to me a marketplace. Well I paid for the printer online I gave them their money online. I received the printer unknowingly I didn't open it right then because I'm trying to start my business and was organizing everything. When I did open it the printer was low in ink and I found that very suspicious. I had not used the printer why would it be low ink. Then I call Walmart they tell me about this third party company called Northridge tech. First it's hard to get in contact with the company the third party company, then no one wants to deal with me because they're saying I'm outside of the return dates window as they call it. My problem here was I wasn't asking for a refund, I just wanted to return this printer because not only did the printer not have ink, the printer doesn't print for your business cards or labels and I wasn't under I wasn't aware of that. I was just trying to get a printer that would help me to do my business and this printer does not apply to any of these things. No one I do business with Walmart groceries everything I have been doing business with Walmart never did I think in my wildest dreams that they do not care for their customers who are loyal customers enough to find a resolution when I'm spending money with them I even had groceries delivered there were of no use because the fruit went bad within 24 hours I didn't ask them for any money, I just threw the food out and then when I'm talking to you all you talk to people such as myself and I'll leave it at that like we are nothing, like our money isn't green and you let companies that don't have any consideration for your customers mess up your good name, so I have reached this conclusion I will never ever in my life waste money or time at walmart.com. if I want something I wanted out of Walmart I'll walk through the door and get it come if there is anything I want from Hewlett-Packard I will go to Hewlett-Packard and get it. One thing I do know for sure I have been dealing with Amazon and never have I ever had this problem. Amazon gets things and they sell them from all parts of the country. Let me tell you this though when you want to return something to them all they going to ask you is why you returning it and that's optional other than that, you take it to Kohl's or wherever else and they're going to give you your credit and there there is no problem they don't give you no problems and that's who I will be dealing with and I suggest anyone else who don't want problems leave walmart.com alone if you don't walk inside and get it leave it alone."

Took battery out, looked, reinserted battery. Nothing. This clock came with no instructions, nor receipt. I am stuck with this clock, from Walmart. If someone sees this and is kind enough to inquire and possibly send another, I would be grateful. Barbara Rogers 424 Monroe Way, NW Kennesaw, GA 30144/404 406 7132"

2513,47203,HeckNoTechnO,25/04/2017,Walmart,"I tried on 3 separate occasions to order a knife set for my daughter-n-laws birthday who lives out of state. As soon as I would order the knives and directly after getting a confirmation email I received a cancellation email. After speaking with customer NO service once and after 1 chat session, I, unfortunately, was unable to order the gift. I don't feel that they cared at all about me or the issues I was having. I spent my money at Amazon."
2514,46783,Karen,25/04/2019,Walmart,"I must shop in an electric cart merely to get through Walmart. So, there I am in the electric cart, clearly disabled, tired, and needing to locate and buy a peppermint plant for IBS medical purposes. There is a large, well stocked plant department I am in the indoor section and have no idea whether they have peppermint plants or where they would be. I approach the employee at the exterior door and ask if they carry them. He asks the employee at the only cash register near the door who, without missing a beat, says they don't carry them. As I prepare to exit the store and go through the outside garden section to the parking lot, what do I see on a shelf next to the door? A shelf with herbs. There, right on the edge of the shelf, clearly labeled, is one peppermint plant. It is the only one on the shelf, in poor condition, but at least it is there. I grab it, return to the cash register and point out that they DO carry it and inquire why nobody bothered to go and look for me. This goes unanswered and neither of the two male employees looks concerned. I ask them to reduce its' price, given it is half or more dead, but I'm willing to take a chance on it and am too tired to go elsewhere to shop. They have to call a third employee to determine if the price should be reduced. I tell her about their lack of checking the shelf for me. She isn't concerned either, but reduces the price appropriately. Service to the disabled community is sorely lacking at this Walmart store which I have repeatedly complained about to its' management."
2515,36313,Jay P.,25/04/2018,Amazon Go,"Went to Seattle for a day trip with the family and were at the fish market, but the kids were more interested in going to the Amazon Go store instead.  So we trekked our way by walking the half a mile to take a gander at what this place is about.  It was easy to find and quite busy.  Being up front it is a smaller store, so don't expect a vast selection of products as if in a regular grocery store.  Also make sure you have to Amazon Go app installed. It's mandatory to shop here.  Inside it can be crowded during busy times, but being able to just grab what you need and walking out made the process much easier. We each also got a cool free recycle bag out of the trip.  You do get a bit of a thought of as if you are doing something wrong by just walking out, but then you realize that this was the main purpose for this store.  The five of us left after each grabbing what we wanted and we were actually charged correctly for what we purchased.  It was quite a trip so see this, but I would definitely say if you are in Seattle to just give it a try!"
2516,36366,Kim T.,25/04/2018,Amazon Go,"WOAH, this blew my mind. I've heard about the cashierless Amazon Go store, but didn't realize that it was literally grab and go! The prices are beyond reasonable (grocery store prices in a convenient location) and the selection was impressive, from healthy snacks to junk food, the store has a bit of everything. The staff is patient with everyone, I was very impressed."
2517,75729,demo,25/04/2021,Amazon Go,Itâ€™s not a bad thing. Itâ€™s more efficient to the economy. Economically this is good
2518,43303,Anne,25/04/2021,Walmart,Worst example Of store policy bought a barbeque Paid certain price for it what online was a different price tried to get the difference back they told me I had to take it apart bring it back order online and that I could get that price instead of just giving me the $48 then Proceeded to argue with me on phone about policy and then put me to a supervisor that did not help me at all this was the worst experience ever
2519,43304,Gwynn Scott,25/04/2021,Walmart,"Walmart has gotten trifling with their customers service, always 1 person working when it's 20 people in line, never call for help. Since Walmart has put all of the Mom. $Pop stores out of business, they have also gotten really Yri.it SUCKS. THE manager will walk Wright pass and not even stop to help."
2520,43305,William,25/04/2021,Walmart,"April 11 2021 I ordered tires online for my 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier Z24 convertible: the recommended size is 205/55R16 (look it up, don't take my word for it). On April 19 I went to the Wal-Mart store in Lawrence IN, 10735 Pendleton Pike, Indianapolis, IN 46236 The Lawrence auto center technicians claimed they couldn't get the wheel off (isn't that their JOB? Smells like maybe an extra $20 or so under the table would get them right off?) Then they claimed the tires I bought were the ""wrong size"" (to be candid, the tires on the car, 195/65R16, are not the recommended size; but perhaps for another $20+ under the table they could install the ""wrong size"" tires?) In fact, the tires I ordered are exactly the right size. Work order to install tires: 4 85700 3974 9 Online order 3722130-080399 Just to satisfy my curiosity, I used my lug wrench to manually loosen, then tighten all four wheels. The lugs were NOT excessively tight. The whole crooked crew should be fired. Perhaps the manager in charge of the auto care center should be fired as well, for allowing this kind of abuse to happen."
2521,43306,Sarah Cappellina,25/04/2021,Walmart,"Their delivery service is horrible. I placed an order to be delivered today between 5-6pm. They never showed up, called, or sent an email. I finally contacted them via customer service chat and was informed they had no drivers. I get that things happen, but no notification by email or phone call? Thatâ€™s unacceptable. I was immediately emailed a $20 promo on my next order from the agent, so this is clearly an ongoing issue. She also told me I could cancel and then reorder my items. Seriously?? You can keep your inadequate promo Walmart, I will go somewhere else."
2522,43392,Joe Davidson,25/04/2021,Walmart,"There is no Customer Service. Talk to their answer bot. That's useless. Why do they continue to use Fedex? The last 4 or 5 deliveries never arrive or days, even weeks late. Day after day on the truck for delivery but not delivered, "" Delivery Exception"". They just don't want to make the delivery. Update: While it continues to be true that Walmart has little customer service for online orders, I have learned that this delivery issue was a Fedex issue with their driver. I assume each of these problem deliveries were because of a driver who was fired."
2523,40713,Kendra A.,25/04/2022,Walmart,Purchased a radio flyer wagon in November of 2021. Once I received it and put it together it was defective. I contacted Walmart.com. They sent out a replacement in January 2022. I returned the defective one in February 2022 in store. I kept receiving emails stating I needed to return the first one. I called them several times and was reassured I would not be recharged because I did return it. Here we are April 2022 and they have recharged my card!!!! I'm more than livid with Walmart!
2524,40714,Carolin Cabrera,25/04/2022,Walmart,"If I could give I 0 star I wouldâ€™ve. Let me start by saying that I rarely encounter any problems with any products I buy at Walmart. However, I had the worst experience today at the Walmart in Venice FL and I have to add it was with the incompetent manager name Jim. This person was rude, unprofessional, and racist. Corporate should look a little closer who they pick as a manager of a store. My daughterâ€™s birthday was yesterday; we decided to buy her one of those electric cars along with a 3 year protection plan. The total cost was $350.96. This morning we try to assemble the car and we noticed some of the screws were missing and others were rusted. I immediately took the car back to either get it exchanged for another one or get my refund back. Well, mister Jim was totally a jerk and decided no to do either or. Meaning we had to kept the incomplete car to ourselves. I contacted cooperate hoping they will resolve this issue and reprimand Jimâ€™s action. But I didnâ€™t get nowhere because itâ€™s Sunday.  I took it upon myself and tried to go to another Walmart located in Osprey FL that is 30 minutes away from home and I have to say I had an outstanding customer service. The lady behind the register was polite and very attentive. She was able to resolve my issue with no problem. I couldnâ€™t get I name but Iâ€™m forever thankful. I hope Jim can learn from her a bit."

2526,47201,Tom S.,26/04/2017,Walmart,We are unhappy with most orders from WalMart.com. Almost all parcels arrive late at our address in Kentucky and we've had 2 orders canceled for no reason.
2527,47202,Cindy Fromm,26/04/2017,Walmart,Unfriendly employees occupy the Walmart store in Roseville. At first it was a very friendly store and it became my main store for sometime. But something happened to make the employees unhappy. No more smiles or greetings just business be done and get out. Lines are now longer to check out and the employees at the self check give you that look like it is such a big hassle if you ask for help.Of course they are just standing there doing nothing. And since we have to buy bags now or bring our own the check out is horrid. Your groceries pile up as you try to bag them as fast as they are being flung at you. Frustration for both employee and customer. Better that I just go to Raley's where their employees are always happy and helpful.
2528,43298,Jag Kotecha,26/04/2021,Walmart,Generally price at Walmart is better than other places even some time by less than 10 cent. They are no good when you shop online. Lower price than any other place to buy but item is out is stock. Give email for in stock notification twice. Email comes in 3 days item in stock and it is a big LIE. Still it is out of stock.You go online and they want to sell something similar and make you FOOL to believe them. If they continue this practice it is time to sell their stock.
2529,43299,Alden,26/04/2021,Walmart,If I could put no stars I would. I ordered 2 large coolers online and only 1 showed up 4 days after is was suppose to. all they would do is refund cost of the item and said to wait for the refund and re-order it. Well it is out of stock and the price has gone up $100 so I am out the complete order and it would cost 2/3 more than the original ordered price. They say they can't issue a new cooler as that is not their policy. Worst customer service I have ever had.
2530,43300,Shane Applegate,26/04/2021,Walmart,Overpriced slow shipping times. No one with a pulse to answer the phone if you call customer service. Just problems and frustration. Lighting your money on fire would be a lot more fun than dealing with Walmart. I now know why I never use this site and always use amazon.com. Walmart.com is one of the most truly pathetic online sales platform on the internet
2531,43301,Debbie Neeve,26/04/2021,Walmart,"On Apr.7 2021 I ordered 3 bras at Walmart.ca They sent me an email saying the ordered was being processed. On April 12, 2021I received another email telling me the order was on the way and that I could expect it tentatively on April 21,2021. On April 19, 2021 I received an email saying that my order had been cancelled. No explanation as to why and that my credit card charge would be refunded. On April 22, 2021 I received an email that read the following ""Due to increased order volume, it is taking longer than expected to deliver your order."" This email for sent for the order that had already been cancelled. I have to say Walmart you have lost my business forever. Get your crap together. You send out emails with tracking numbers and those numbers can never be tracked through Walmart Logistics. I am so done with your organization. I could have ordered the same product at The Bay for the same price but since I went with Walmart.ca I lost out on the opportunity and when I received your order cancellation email The product at The Bay was out of stock."
2532,43302,Ashley,26/04/2021,Walmart,I ordered a delivery order to be delivered between 7-8pm. 8 pm the order was still not delivered. I called Walmart and they said that the driver picked up the order at 8pm. 9pm the order was still not delivered. I called Walmart back and they said the driver canceled the pick up because the store closed. They said they could deliver the order the next day from 8-9 when I would be at work. Now it is not able to be delivered until 2 days later in the evening. Worst service!

2534,47299,Elizabeth Malone,27/04/2016,Walmart,"I ordered an air conditioner that FedEx never delivered. After reporting it to FedEx which included sending in supporting documentation (Wal-Mart receipt) and waiting for them to send me a check , three weeks passed by with little contact from them. Living in a coastal town with temperatures steadily climbing during this intermittent time, I receive an email that a decision had been reached. I contacted FedEx customer service and was told it was DENIED! I tried to contact Davis King, FedEx claims, who worked the case, per a customer service rep's advice via live chat, but when I tried to call was denied access to him so that I could explain I wasn't a con artist, the air conditioner was NEVER delivered! I contacted Wal-Mart.com in complete frustration asking for help. I paid and Wal-Mart shipped, we did our respective parts, FedEx didn't deliver. Do you know what happened next? Two days later I received a replacement air conditioner HASSLE FREE from Wal-Mart.com!!!! Did I mention that the reason for my buying the air conditioner is because I have an asthmatic in the house? I told FedEx who didn't hustle the ""investigation"" along to bring about a suitable solution. I WILL make sure that FedEx reimburses Wal-Mart.com. In the meantime, 3 cheers to Wal-Mart.com!! Hip hip, hoorrraaayyyy!!!!! Hope it never happens to you! Elizabeth Malone"
2535,46782,Lee Martin,27/04/2019,Walmart,Really do love Walmart...for years. Lately Iâ€™ve been super disappointed with the set up of the store and the lack of workers with too many bullsoup empty tolls everywhere. Now Iâ€™m never going back to Walmart and it happens to be across the street from me. I guess I can say...good idea on the online shopping. Because Iâ€™m never going back!!!
2536,45396,Lisa Riese Perschke,27/04/2020,Walmart,"Too bad you can't give Walmart.com a -5 star rating. I have been purchasing many items through Walmart.com for two months now.  I have been double charged for items twice now. I can't get through to their customer service team to get this matter straightened out and get my two refunds.  I received a set of Pyrex glass bowls mistakenly instead of my LaCroix water that they shipping department said that I received, which I did not. The customer service person Kathleen (4/4/2020) and she told me there was no way for her to send me a UPS mailing label so I could send the mistakenly sent item back to them. Meanwhile I have them stored in my home waiting until this Pandemic is over to have them returned.  All I want is a refund for being charged twice for two items... is that too much to ask? I recommend that any one who is considering ordering things with Walmart.com, please reconsider and go with Kroger or Amazon Prime.com. Those sites are far superior than Walmart.com.  Best to you, Lisa"
2537,45397,Ree,27/04/2020,Walmart,During this time of COVID-19 businesses were asked not to gorge up prices but Walmart has taken advantage of this unfortunate situation to jack up there prices.

2538,45398,Suzanne A,27/04/2020,Walmart,"Customer service is horrible! Wanted me to ship back an item picked up in the store, and the item was a large pillow with arms, not shippable. They would not ship them to me, but expected me to ship a return? Customer service would not accept the return at the store, all because the employee did not mark the item picked up! I ended up keeping them. Also another note, shipping is horrific! Two or three weeks out to receive order.... (they ship one item at an a time yet), then some of the items getting cancelled? Not acceptable, and this was before the Covid-19 panic buying. It has only gotten worse. I have turned to others retailers and happily doing so, as I get my items in 4-5 days tops! Walmart you have to get it together, no excuses."

2540,43294,ROBERT COATES,27/04/2021,Walmart,"I am a regular WM customer, spending hundreds of dollars every month for food and other necessities. Today I went to WM and their incompetence registered a new low. I wanted a watch battery which I have purchased at WM for probably 20 years. At the jewelry dept. No one was there so I approached another associate and asked that they call for help to sell me a battery. The associate stated that they don't sell watch batteries. I asked if she was sure and she, obviously annoyed, walked over to another associate in the customer service dept. I couldn't hear the conversation but the first associate came back and stated that watch batteries are sold in the electronics dept. I knew this was erroneous but walked back to electronics and asked the young man for a watch battery. He stated that they don't have watch batteries and to go to the jewelry dept. Now frustrated I asked the associate to call for a manager. He did page a manager and I waited for another 15 minutes and no one came. I had already shopped for two other items from produce and pharmacy and walked up to the jewelry counter and left a cucumber and antacid meds on the counter. I gave up... I subsequently went to a Target store and bought the needed batteries, cucumbers, and meds."

There was a woman on the Hair Care aisle, squatting down, she open gels, moisturizers,heat protector, conditioners, hair mayonnaise,anything she touched,she would smell it, put her fingers into the product,then rub it on her body, then put it back on the shelf.I was standing right behind her, that didn't seem to bother her one bit. Needless to say how unsanitized.I was so disgusted, I exited the store immediately. I Express my unhappiness with two guys in the lawn and garden area. Not sure if anything was done about this matter."
2542,43296,Dr Randall Heskett,27/04/2021,Walmart,My wife bought me a lat pulldown machine for my birthday. Walmart sent the wrong parts. I have been trying to work with them to fix this four times. They have failed me. Are they just incompetent or are they just trying to hold onto my money? The worst service. I donâ€™t think I am going to order from them again.
2543,43297,Will Atkinson,27/04/2021,Walmart,"I have been trying since November 2020 to address some faulty products sold by Walmart store #05064. Mr. Monte McCulloch is elusive and i have never been able to discuss my concerns with him, and his manager Mark was rude to discount the fact that my 14 clients and 30 members of our nonprofit organization spend $1.000's there weekly. It is not just the fact that we spend 6 figures in their store yearly, it was the treatment from Mark i detest, and Mr McCulloch doesn't seem to care. I just wanted to rectify the fact that i spent almost $400 on crappy products and we dont have money to waste on items that broke within 30 days or never worked at all. I have stopped shopping at this store because of the treatment."
2544,40710,Patrick Obarr,27/04/2022,Walmart,"Seriously donâ€™t understand how they stay in business, if they was a a small retail store they wouldnâ€™t last a week. I ordered an item online for my sonâ€™s birthday, no where on the order did it state it was gonna be a signature required item for delivery. So with that said I work every day and canâ€™t be here to sign and they will not help in anyway or return item until itâ€™s been attempted to be delivered 3 times then said 5-7 days after they receive it back until the refund will take place. I always regret using Walmart but this is the last time!"
2545,40711,Neal G,27/04/2022,Walmart,"Ordered a window blind through Walmart. Found same blind at Home Depot for half the price so waited 4 extra days to receive and the product was not worth the price. Asked to return and was told in original bxx with original paperwork and do not write on the paperwork or we wont accept it back, put a copy of this and a copy of that and insure the package and send a copy of the tracking number and 6 other steps to return a 40$ blind that was probably worth 10$. Cannot even fathom the thought that a company like Walmart would associate themselves with such a horrendous company as this one. Actually would have cost more to pay for return shipping and insurance than was originally paid. Awful Awful Company !!! Shame on Walmart !"

I have to shop for two households because my 83 yr old mother in law cannot shop for herself or get her medicine or drive. I had two separate orders and had paid for hers with her money and was going ahead with my own order when the clerk took my toilet paper because I already purchased one for her. I tried to explain it was for two separate households and separate payments and that my elderly mom in law cannot shop for herself but he would have none of that. I offered to show him the separate payment but NO! It really makes things very difficult and very frustrating for me and I'm sure some others when you have to make separate trips for two households. I think an exception could have been made since it was only one pkg for us and one for her. SHAME ON YOU

My total purchase came out to $176, they did a automatic pickup for the pillow and bike the next day, when it was time for me to pick up the items they texted me and told me the items werenâ€™t ready and gave me a different time to pick them up. I was ok until I got another text telling me partial of my order was cancelled and the other half was ready for pickup ðŸ™„ðŸ™„, you can guess which one that was (the pillow). So I drove all the way to Walmart for a pillow and since there was bikes there I bought one for my son thinking Iâ€™ll have my money back for the other one that was canceled (nope). So my expected delivery date was 25 which exactly 10days from the day it was shipped out and I figured it was ok because of the way shipping has been lately so a couple days past and I noticed they still processing the $176 on my account but when I look at the app and my purchases it said a new total of $93.03 and the bike was cancelled so I called to see why I havenâ€™t received my refund and they told me I will once my items were shipped. Ok so the next day they were shipped out but still no refund on the bike so I figured Iâ€™d give a day because you know how banks can be, but nope I still had the pending $176 so I called again only for them to tell me I had to wait for my items be delivered... ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«. So during the call I found out that they actually split up the 93.03 and took it and still have my $176!!! So fast forward to delivery day, I waited all day my items said they were out for delivery and I should receive them at the end of the day but guess what?, nope ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¾ 8pm came and nothing!!!!! That was sat. Here it is Monday and I still havenâ€™t received anything ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾â€â™€ï¸At this point I just want all my money back because this crap ridiculous and Iâ€™m fed up with the run around and the extra $93 they took"
2558,45395,Jack Donahue,28/04/2020,Walmart,"DON'T WASTE YOU TIME AND MONEY! Walmart promises you quick delivery time but ALWAYS fails to deliver as promised. Call them and you get put into ""chat"" with a 156 MINUTE HOLD TIME! proving once again that only STUPID people shop at Walmart."
2559,36244,Vincent L.,28/04/2018,Amazon Go,"Quite the tourist draw but not significantly different from an urban neighborhood-sized Tesco or Sainsbury's outlet that you would find in London, right down to the abundance of prepared food items and meal kits. If anything, this store reminds me of a convenience store-sized version of the Fresh & Easy chain we used to have in California.  You need to download the Amazon Go app onto your phone and scan a barcode to get in. Once you're in, you can pick items from the shelves to your heart's content. There aren't any carts or baskets, but at the moment they are giving away free paper bags and orange reusable canvas bags. Offerings include drinks, snacks, candy, prepared meals, meal kits, booze, and personal-care items like tampons. Prices were quite reasonable for brand-name offerings (an Odwalla juice was only $2.49, for example), while prepared food items were somewhere between ""inexpensive"" and ""takeout""-priced.  Surprisingly, all you need to do is walk through the turnstiles again to get out of the store and all your purchases will have been tracked. No need to swipe your phone again. Staff members are really helpful. If there's any drawback, it's that so many people are simply gawking and talking selfies while inside - so much so that the aisles can get crowded and there can be a wait to get in. But seriously, there ought to be more stores like this in locations like office buildings where there aren't many restaurants around."
2560,36278,Sharon H.,28/04/2018,Amazon Go,"In and out of Amazon Go never felt so easy.  Amazon Go is located a few feet from the Amazon Sphere, which I'd also give a gander if you're in Seattle for a quick trip.  In order to enter Amazon Go, you'll need to download the Amazon Go app first. Login to the app with your Amazon account and select your card payment of choice. To enter, you'll need to open the app, scan in to enter, begin your shopping, walk out, and be billed shortly after. It's super intuitive, clever, and smart.  If you're bringing family members and friends, you can use your Amazon Go app to scan them in as well. When you scan them in, anything they grab will show up on your bill as well.  From the outside, Amazon Go is very tiny and the selection of items are quite limited. However, if you're looking for a quick meal or snack, I'd definitely visit Amazon Go so I don't need to search for my wallet to pay."
2561,36427,Anas J.,28/04/2018,Amazon Go,"The experience is really nice, and one of a kind so far, and it worked good for us. But honestly was expecting a bigger store, it was super small, even smaller than 7-11 on gas stations with very limited items. But probably it is just a trial."
2562,36453,Todd S.,28/04/2018,Amazon Go,"After watching the promotional videos when the store opened, I was surprised at how small the store is. It's about 1/3 the size of the Quickie Mart from the Simpsons.  I really enjoyed the experience and would go again.  I thought it would be possible to see my shopping cart on my phone, but that wasn't working the time I went. I had to trust that they knew what I was taking. About an hour later, I got my receipt."
2563,43290,Christopher Atkin,28/04/2021,Walmart,"I have been a Walmart shopper for years, like many others, due to covid, online has become the new normal method of shopping. Over the years I have bought a few things from walmart.com. Nothing of not, not fast, not cheap, just worked kind of. Trying it again, I bought a gift for my daughter, went great, no problem, fast, and cheap. A couple weeks later my niece's birthday, she lives 1200 miles away, I thought this would work great.  I made the purchase, the order was canceled. I was trying a new credit card to see if it was active, I figured it wasn't so I tried it again, but with a different card that I know worked...  ...Canceled again.  I contact the bank for the first card, they said, no the order was canceled by the merchant, since my account was new it would be a few days to know why.  Ok  I called the second. They were unable to access my account at this time due to a pending fraud investigation. Upset with the whole situation, I was going to a physical store, stopped for gas, went to use my debit card. Declined, all three of my other cards, the same. I call each one of the banks... All 3 said the same thing. WALMART reported me for FRAUD for making a purchase through their service.  I REPEAT, ALL I DID WAS PURCHASE FROM WALMART.COM WITH A VISA. I cannot stress the negative effects. I have sustained a 93 point drop overnight in my credit score, I have no money, because all of my accounts are frozen, I was denied for the apartment we were about to move into and I lost my new job because I was reported for fraud for buying from them, by them online, with my accounts, with money in the accounts. Run, before they can get you too. Run. Thieves, monsters, sociopaths, they said they will discontinue their investigation in 90 days if they don't have proof by then. I don't have any money, any home, any job, not any way of getting them either thanks to buying from walmart.com they have no remorse for their actions. We are not people to them. We are just a currency source."
2564,43291,J. M.,28/04/2021,Walmart,Bought a outdoor sectional at walmart.com (order #3832149-743504) and got 1 box with missing parts. Called walmart.com and was told to call the manufacturer myself to request delivery of missing pieces. Years and thousands of purchases with Amazon without problems and the 1st time with Walmart and this stuff happens! DO NOT BUY @ WALMART!!!!!
2565,43292,Daryl Montana,28/04/2021,Walmart,"This review process sucks, just like Walmart, and their rude and lazy associates. My cashier, Angela from the Broadway store, actually threw my toilet paper at me today. Way to go Angela you have such awesome customer service skills, and why, just because I did not want to stand in two lines to pay for my things. I would seriously give you and Walmart negative 5 stars if it were an option. Over the years I have come to hate Walmart, and this just takes the cake. I was actually told by an associate last summer 2020 that Walmart does not give a poop about their customers. It is totally true, I already knew this by associates attitudes and inability to provide decent customer service skills evident by the hundreds of times I have gone to the customer service center to find one associate and a line. Does your associate call for help nope they do not care if the customer has other things to do besides stand in a line waiting and waiting and for what so this god awful store can save a buck with fewer associates instead of properly staffing your store so customers can get in and out that need to.I do not mind having to have to buy my makeup in the makeup dept but I should not be expected to then go elsewhere to pay for the rest of my stuff. you guys are the ones that made it so certain things have to be purchased in their dept so let customers pay for their other things as well. It is unprofessional and rude to throw my toilet paper at me. I will never come back to any Walmart.Wake up Walmart, it is ok to want to be top business, but good god take care of the people that make your business top of the line. Thumbs down to all of you!!!"
2566,43293,Jeff Cunjak,28/04/2021,Walmart,"What a horrible experience buying an Evoo computer. I had it plugged in most of the time. When I finally unplugged it the battery was dead. The people servicing the computer had it for six weeks. During that time I asked multiple times for an update and never got one. Now, six weeks later they tell me it can't be fixed and they're sending me a new one. Who goes without their computer for six weeks? During this time Walmart was absolutely no help, directing all my inquiries to Evoo. I thought buying a computer from Walmart and buying the extended warranty would make it easier to deal with any problems. Wrong...Do not buy electronics from Walmart."
2567,40704,Bims Bo,28/04/2022,Walmart,"Received treadmill 4/14. Found it damaged. Requested refund. They took 3 days to get the label to me. FedEx pickup unsuccessful- too heavy. He promised to return and never did. I was bounced from Walmart to FedEx. They arranged another pickup, then another. Iâ€™ve been begging for them to get this worthless thing out of here. After they dropped the ball twice, they said theyâ€™d process my refund- since everything was due to their negligence. 5 days later Iâ€™m told that that was a lie. Itâ€™s as if theyâ€™re keeping my money and forcing me to keep the damaged treadmill. Now theyâ€™re saying that FedEx is no equipped to handle the treadmill. This is after theyâ€™ve arranged for them to pick it up 3 times. In the meantime I have a useless treadmill and canâ€™t get my money. It has been exactly 2 weeks and Iâ€™m still begging. I would never have thought that I would be stuck in this kind of shopping nightmare- especially from Walmart. Itâ€™s horrible!â€™"
2568,40705,Michael Ilcyn,28/04/2022,Walmart,"I have never experienced such poor customer service as a Walmart + member. I placed an order for a $500.00 product that Walmart simply claims has been â€œlostâ€ in the mail. As a Walmart + member this is certainly not the service I was expecting when entrusting this company with a large sum of money.  After being on the phone with not only Walmart customer service, but also the shipping company hired to deliver my product (because Walmart could not speak directly with the people they hired), no solution has been made.  The order I placed was listed at $500.00 however it is also listed on Walmarts website for $787.96. That being said I spoke with a customer service agent yesterday who assured me I could be credited the $308.10 difference (to cover fees, taxes, and shipping) so that I would be able to repurchase and receive my item.  The way in which Walmart as a company has handled this issue is nothing short of appalling! I certainly do not expect to be treated this way as a customer let alone a Walmart + member. Absolutely disgraceful!"
2569,40706,Thomas Warden,28/04/2022,Walmart,"Walmart knowingly enables the fraudulent trade practices of it's marketplace sellers... Like Hayneedle... Hayneedle is very likely the most fraudulently abusive retailer on earth... Their product listings grossly misrepresent the appearance and quality of the items being sold to the point where they're basically committing fraud. Then, once they have wasted a customers time, they offer only a return of the misrepresented item as solitary solution, knowing full well that most customers won't return an item after having invested so much time and effort obtaining it, and then trying to resolve their fraudulent misrepresentations... It's really just disgusting..."

2573,47199,Angel Ted,29/04/2017,Walmart,They used to be good about matching prices. Now they don't match prices at all. Shipment takes slower than usual also. I guess they have competition from Amazon

Walmart confirmed order, charged my acct on Tuesday b/4 delivery. While actually waiting for the delivery, a Walmart-no reply text stating ""Your order has been canceled."" No reason, nothing; just canceled. Called number provided someone who couldn't speak English but said our $200+ dollars would be refunded in 10 days. Local store gave number direct to delivery; VM ""sorry we're closed."" Happy Hungry Easter weekend guests. Can't use coupons, limited selection, it's a total waste of time. A complete disaster ."
2576,45363,Lee Parker,29/04/2020,Walmart,"I was ordering a pick up of several items from Walmart and set my preference to pick up at a store in Grand Prairie TX. I placed the order and was then notified my order would be at the South Irving TX store, which is a dump. went to the South Irving store and tried several times to call and have my order delivered to me at the designated parking area, but the phone was always busy and I could never leave a message. I stopped an employee, who was making a curb side delivery and was told I had to go into this filthy dirty store to get my order. over a third of the customers didn't have the required mask on. I signed in and waited, but no service. I checked at customer care and they finally got someone to get my order for me. It wasn't all ready and It took almost 30 minutes to get the order to me while I waited inside this stinking store. If I can't select and pick up from the store I requested I will not be suing Walmart at this location again. This south Irving TX store has more problems and danger of being robbed or assaulted in the parking lot than any other store. It should be closed."

I called yesterday 04-28-2020 I was informed to put the heavy box outside and fed-ex will be here by 8pm to pick it up yea ok. I spoke to a supervisor and the damn supervisor named Joy was nothing she can assist me with not even a credit for the damn inconvenience. Iâ€™m sick of the bs if this crap ainâ€™t picked up Iâ€™m tossing it.
2578,45365,Amy,29/04/2020,Walmart,I ordered from Walmart.com and immediately noticed order was going to incorrect address. I immediately began canceling this order. For 24 hours I tried! I talked to 2 separate customer service reps and was assured items were canceled. I had to hold both times for over one hour each call. Now Iâ€™m getting shipping notices! I have been charged for all items. This is sooooo frustrating when we are told to order online not shop in store. Donâ€™t waste time with Walmart. Iâ€™m an American and prefer to speak English. Both of these reps spoke very broken English.

I had filled a shopping cart with $300 worth of items and was almost to the end of the checkout when I thought I wonder who Walmart uses for delivery so I googled and found out it's FedEx I have had years worth of misery and headaches dealing with FedEx and will not purchase anything delivered by them. companies need to specify who their delivery system is so that people will know not to purchase from them if they use FedEx.

I was smiling the whole time I was in the place and ended up returning for a second visit very promptly after I left.  It's really an excellent execution, from the technology to the food choice and clean look of the store; the whole team did an excellent job on this product.  The technology is very impressive, the staffers were very friendly and answered my questions, and also the food selection is high quality.  Highlights:  1. Amazon has an onsite kitchen where they prepare some of the food (good looking entrees, sandwiches, fruit cups, etc).  2. I saw a lot of locally sourced prepared foods (Macarena Bakery, Alki Bakery, Blazing Bagels, Theo Chocolates, Molly's, etc).  3. The 'Middle Eastern Sandwich.' I didn't try it, but it caught my eye because usually this kind of stuff is labeled as 'Mediterranean Sandwich.' A big Thank You to whomever made the decision to call it 'Middle Eastern!'  4. Odwalla prices are better than what you find at Fred Meyer."

Contacted customer service the same day of delivery, it was pushed back my request to return 3 times each time 3 days. Everytime the agent escalates without solution. The last time the agent cancelled my request by her own decision which made me to ask for a supervisor who was extremely useless like a robot repeats the same phrases.and rude and hanged up the call.

When I didn't hear anything after the expected delivery date, I chatted online and they escalated the issue promising to contact me. No one contacted me within a week, though, and today I had to call myself. They promised a refund but no compensation for the inconvenience caused. Now, when the baby can be born at any time, I have to rush and look for another stroller and the same one costs $170 more than the original one!!! I am extremely disappointed and will never use the online delivery any more!!! Complete disaster!!!"

The Walmart.com website wouldn't allow me to. Secondly, a live chat agent wouldn't promise me anything either. I think they're based in India! Other than a wait and see within 48 hrs. e-mail status cancel confirmation. Poor service. Especially since their policy says that an order can be cancelled IF still being processed?"

You will be contacted by email when ready. They charge your account and then you don't hear from them again. I contacted the store and customer service and neither could help. They said I should understand They are busy. If so they should not say same day pickup and not charge for product unless they can supply it. Worst service ever!!!!!

We paid a lot of money for a TV that died 8 months later and should be under warranty. ""not our problem"" is Walmarts new slogan."

Over a week later, I noticed the statuses online that items were still not received. So I looked up the FedEx tracking numbers on the receipts the associates provided and they were all invalid! I called the North Bergen store. Wow, such unprofessionalism. The associates would just hang up the phone. I also submitted a complaint to Walmart Corporate and they were useless - they told me to directly deal with 3rd party sellers. Luckily, I purchased my items via PayPal Credit and I submitted claims with them. Within ONE day PayPal resolved my claims and refunds were processed. Never again, Walmart. Can't believe this is one of the richest corporations with such crappy customer service."
2600,40700,David Yuan,29/04/2022,Walmart,"I placed an order for three cases of Mobil 1 high mileage engine oil in September 2019. I did not receive an email notice for pickup at the local Walmart in Dorval, QC. So the order was shipped back and I got a refund in November 2019. However, I later found out in late March of 2020 that I received the refunds of two cases, not three. I wrote a letter to the headquarters on April 1. I heard nothing from them. I then tried to phone the customer services without getting through after having waited on the phone for four hours. I wrote emails to customer service twice, still no response. I eventually went to the Walmart in Dorval, QC to ask the customer service there. They told me that only two cases were shipped back and one was picked up. But I did not pick up anything! I demand to find out who picked up that one case and a refund of $86.91 + taxes totaling $99.99. After fighting with Walmart HQ for another month or so, it turned out that the seller shipped only two cases, not three, to Walmart Dorval. The order was not fulfilled so no email was sent to me for notifying me to pick up. Eventually I got my refund. I dare not shop at Walmart online again."
2601,40701,Todd R.,29/04/2022,Walmart,"If I could give zero stars, I would. Hands down the worst online buying experience Iâ€™ve ever had. Purchased an item for my business, only for it to get lost in transit. Multiple phone calls, completely ineffective and useless customer service, supervisors, and â€œescalationâ€ process. Multiple hours wasted on my end trying to get answers. Multiple promises to contact me with a resolution, not one single email or phone call received. 4 weeks later, and still waiting on a refund, as no one that you can contact has the authority to handle such an audacious request. Shouldâ€™ve gone with Amazonâ€¦ Next time I will."
2602,40702,matthew nicholson,29/04/2022,Walmart,"Purchase an item from Walmart. It was sold through a Chinese fulfillment company called Joybuy America.  Never received.  Walmart accepted no responsibility for lost item. Punted to vendor who has done nothing other than have me, the customer do the leg work with the post office.  $15 bucks and Walmart loses a customer. Go figure. Guess Walmart wants Amazon to win again."
2603,40703,Kimberly Fetter,29/04/2022,Walmart,"The Walmart Pharmacy in Stoughton Wi is full of rude employees! I stood back so as not to be cutting in and when I got someone's attention, said I just have a question. They said there's a line. I said just a question they said go to the back of the line. I have to wait behind 3 people to ask what isle something is in? Just a question! It wouldn't have interfered with any other customers in the line. I was walking away and and a employee, who said this wasn't his regular store said he'd be glad to answer a question. Thank You young man! Literally took 1 second to answer. Have also encountered rude people in the drive thru not to mention long wait times. Few times ago, 28 minutes for a script they had already notified me was ready. Rude and understaffed!!"

2617,43274,Devan Clark Tolle,30/04/2021,Walmart,This is the 4th. Time me and my husband has came to Walmart to use customer service to cash his pay check and pay our bills not to mention spend a couple hundred dollars on things we need but once again it's closed cause they said there's no one there to work it. What kind of crap is that? There are 50 employees stocking shelves and sitting around chilling but no customer service. Then on top of that no cashier's. The lines had 15 people in them and reached half way thru the store. I thought managers were trained to work all stations. I guess I was wrong. Well we had over $200 in stuff so we just left it. I mean if they can't get anybody to work then they need to look into whoever manages that place cause we just seen 3 more people leave there stuff and walk out. West Union walmart is terrible.
2618,43275,Frank King,30/04/2021,Walmart,Don't order on line from Walmart case it will say package delivered when it hasn't been delivered and when you contract Walmart they tell you to wail another 48 hours which already 24 hours late.
2619,43276,sr,30/04/2021,Walmart,"The worst customer service. Have been trying to do a pay in store order for almost a month. After multiple attempts the managers at the store contacted their help center and where told that the systems where not working together correctly. I was given the choice to either keep trying or to pay for the items online and bring them back into the store so they could do a resale of the items in order to change how the items where paid for. After doing this I am being told that they can not do that due to the part numbers not being in the computer to do this and that I would need to contact customer service. I have been given a phone number by email from the online customer service saying that is to a special store team and they would be able to help me. I have spoken to 8 different people 4 of them stated all they could do was a return and that I would have to take them back to the store and then hung up. One of them gave me a number saying that I could go through this department, but the number that was given to me was to a different insurance company. Then I tried calling again and was bounced to different people and departments after I asked to speak with a supervisor due to being told different things by every one and not getting any help with the problem. After being bounce around to different departments and still not speaking to a supervisor they had put me on hold and after a few minutes was hung up on again. As it stands after this I may never buy from Walmart again."
2620,43277,Janneth bh,30/04/2021,Walmart,I got a oil change for my car. Took an hour and a half to get it done. Usually is about 30 min. I asked the crew member why took so long he said he was working by him self with a new employee. I try not to be upset because his superviser should make sure he get all he need to do a good job. Still I am really upset I lost some money because I was 1 hour late at my job. And I have to pay for a terrible service.
2621,43278,Heather Trinneer,30/04/2021,Walmart,"I made a purchase on Walmart.com on March 31st for a 4x6 storage shed that was supposed to be delivered, latest expected delivery by April 16th. I waited a week before calling to find out where and what is going on because I haven't received a tracking number yet. Not one person was willing to help me beyond saying that the warehouse is preparing it. I was still being told on April 20 that it WILL arrive by April 16th. After days of calling, getting hung up on, told that there isn't anything they can do ... I was actually told by a Walmart representative to reorder on Amazon because I would receive it that way. On April 22 they decided to put it in as lost in transport and reordered it. I am still, 1 month after I ordered for any information. I still haven't received a tracking number. I keep asking them to transfer me to someone that can actually help if you are unable to. I tried emailing the CEO with no response. At this point I feel like I was robbed. As a customer, I did my job ... I ordered, I paid and at this point, it appears that Walmart either can't or won't fix any problems and take care of customers. I lost a job that I was supposed to start because my car had to be the shed that I ordered and haven't received. This has been the worst experience ever."
2622,43279,Upset in Cordova,30/04/2021,Walmart,"WATCH YOUR BANK ACCOUNT! HORRIBLE WALMART.COM EXPERIENCES! Walmart needs to do a major overhaul of it's online ordering and delivery process. Free delivery doesn't always mean honest, professional and reliable. After sitting on hold for well over an hour, nobody ever came to the phone. Walmart charged me $128+ for products that I still have not received! That toyed around with something as simple as a $3.54 box of Q-tips they either counldn't figure out whether they had them in stock or not, b c my bank account showed this amount being constantly either debited or credited on my account. Now, customer service eventually got back with me to, so-called, escalate my complaint of not ever receiving anything at my door after many orders placed with them since last year, while the process was haphazard and disorganized, I never, until yesterday spent this much money at one time in an order, then, never receive the actual products that they swear FedEx delivered to my door yesterday. I filed a Better Business Bureau complaint requesting a refund, b c I don't play games with companies stealing or messing around with my hard earned money while they mismanage their businesses then charge me for $128 worth of products that I am still looking out the door to see if the boxes will ever turn up!!! I don't recommend placing any orders with them. While FEDEx, I think, is generally good, either they never delivered my items, delivered to wrong address, or delivered and were stolen by either FedEx or someone else. Either way, I want my money back and won't stop until I get it. I have Legal Shield and it won't cost me one more dime to get my attorney after Walmart in this instance. If I don't hear from the Better Business Bureau within 5 days, the CEO will be hearing from my attorney about how his operations are not professionally operating....in my experience and opinion!"
2623,43280,CMacArthur,30/04/2021,Walmart,Ordered product online. Provided 3 week delivery date which seemed long. It's now over 3 weeks and product hasn't shipped Should have ordered from Amazon. Never again WalMart.

The only people they want are the ones that are lazy and kiss their butts everyone knows it and they have their cliques they run in and all the stuff they say in training about equality and no favorites and managers can't do things is bull i loved my job enjoyed it and helping people but I didn't kiss butt I didn't need to and all my managers knew I didn't n my work spoke for itself and it took one assistant manager not liking me cause I didn't kiss butt and stood up when I was right n that's it boom worked for 9 months no problems then 1 coaching then another one 2 weeks lmbo and when talked to main people nothing they back their managers no matter how wrong they are they need to go in to stores and break this kind of stuff up and make it equal place and where when you go to store manager or co and talk it stays there like it is suppose to not as soon as you leave they run and tell the AM what was said and done. It's messed up really but all of America can see it you go in and all the workers that have been there years and years are obese and lazy and do not want people asking them for help and some will tell customers their off the clock or something just to keep from working and those are the one they keep I mean come on really.
2627,45250,Customer,13/05/2020,Walmart,"bought clothing from you online (I live in NJ)and there was sales tax charged. There is no sales tax on clothing in NJ. I figured this was an error and would be fixed when it shipped. When I shop online in any other site, Target, Etsy, eBay, I am ONLY charged sales tax on items that are taxed in NJ. It's not determined by where the item is SENT FROM, as many come from across seas where they have NO TAX...yet I am rightfully charged if it is a taxable item in NJ at NJ's tax rate. My request for a refund was denied as Walmart claims it can charge tax based on the merchant's state, not the point of sale. NO OTHER ONLINE SITE DOES THIS!  Here is the review I am posting on every social media site I can and will be contacting the BBB and news media. People have a right to know how Walmart is basically stealing from people, and especially in these times, that is beyond reprehensible.  BEWARE! When you buy clothing from here, Walmart charges you sales tax, even if your state doesn't tax clothing. They CLAIM it's because it is being shipped from a state that does have it! With people being as hard hit as we are now, this is another truly *** greedy robber baron move on the part of Walmart. When I buy clothes from ANY OTHER place I am not charged, as my state NJ, doesn't tax therm. The tax is to be collected at the POINT OF SALE and the state tax where it is being SHIPPED , not where it's shipped to. Please share this so people know what dirtbags this company is!  I filed a dispute with paypal and was denied. Here is their response:  I understand in New Jersey there is no sales tax on clothes. When you purchase online you may not be purchasing within the state of New Jersey. You have to pay whatever fees are associated with purchasing wherever the merchant may be located.  PayPal would not be able to fight the legality of this dispute and that is why we denied the claim. You would need to take legal action to pursue this further.  Please feel free to share this on any social media you use, I know I am!  User's recommendation: DO NOT BUY CLOTHING HERE!  WalMart Cons: Slimy ethics, Illegal charges, No response from company to complaints."
2628,45251,Paul Otruba,13/05/2020,Walmart,5/13/200 Went to Walmart in Mansfield Pa today and at least 6 of the employees were wearing their virus masks on their chin. The risk of infection is just too great to shop there; there are other grocery stores and on line shopping which will be happy for my business.
2629,45252,Jonathan Lapin,13/05/2020,Walmart,I ordered a few products online from walmart.com (since all the kiosks are closed due to Covid). I've waited over two weeks now and the whole time the order said they would be delivered last week and it ony arrived today. The tracking didn't work correctly but it got here eventually. Bit disappointing.

We took our car in for tire repair/replacement since we had purchased the road hazard insurance. Usually warranty work will get you pushed to the end of the customer service line since they know it is going to be free, but not in this case. Even though they were busy they had us in and out in 30 minutes with a new tire and Brian was so very helpful! Well done Brian and well done Walmart!"

2633,45256,Eric Fitch,13/05/2020,Walmart,NEVER AGAIN! This delivery system is pure garbage! Even with tracking you never know when It's going to change and since you have 12 deliveries over a two week span on the ONE order you put in...So far 4 out of the 7 items have been stolen. No I don't blame Walmart for theft. I DO blame them on causing so much confusion the only only way would be to hire a 24 guard. Good luck even trying to get ahold of Walmart. They just brush you off and refer you to the delivery drivers.

2642,43203,Shar O'Brien,13/05/2021,Walmart,"I've already lost my money. This is just a warning for anyone else. MarketPlace, a Walmart selling site for 3rd party sellers, is not really backed by Walmart. I ordered shoe boxes, which were just flimsy plastic file-folder thingies (not even the point). Tried to return them, but got blocked by offers of 'some' money back instead. Twenty, then forty, sixty, eighty (unfortunately I spent over 300, so I didn't bite). Ended up suckered into sending them back to China (they originally came from a warehouse in Mississauga, Ontario). Cost me $146.00 bucks. By boat! (plane was $50 bucks more) Only way to complain to Walmart is by phone or live chat (live chat is useless). Best part? I wrote a humorous, though rough review, because I wanted it posted, on MarketPlace. Walmart rejected it. Wow. Nice gig. Get to rip me off, then edit which reviews people post online. My only objective is, watch out. The fine print said 'returns welcome'. Just didn't mention I had to return them to China."

2644,40649,Alicia Montalvo,13/05/2022,Walmart,"I would give Walmart a zero if I could but I have to leave at least a 1-star rating. I was there on May 11th, 2022 at the Walmart on 8001 US HIGHWAY 19 PINELLAS PARK, FL. As I was paying for my stuff which totaled over $300.00 the cashier Krista G. seemed to already have a crazy nasty attitude toward me apparently she decided to go over board when it was time to slide my car (mind you I have a cast on my hand and arm all the way up to my elbow. As I was trying to slide my debit card the machine kept dropping down and as she could see it was broken and I kept telling her that it kept canceling my card so she decided to get nasty and start yelling like a crazy woman and I finally lost my patience with her and told her as you can see it's broken and I have a cast on my hand. So I asked to speak to her manager and out of nowhere, she yelled out the top of her long Customer Service! like she was in a barn. Finally, a manager comes which I already knew she was not going to hear or listen to what happened also had a nasty attitude, and when I tried to explain to her what happened all she had to say was to go. Go? really is that how your employees treat your customers? Fix your equipment so people don't have to struggle to slide a credit card through and have your crazy cashiers go off the deep end."
2645,40651,Will,13/05/2022,Walmart,Walmart has become a hostile place for me to shop because the customers get so irate and impatient after waiting in line for purchases and returns. They don't hire enough employees and that makes the lines and waiting much longer. It's become such a problem for me that I refuse to go there anymore to risk being in the middle of a angry customers getting physical.

2647,47293,Rick Hand,14/05/2016,Walmart,"Did not meet their shipping estimated date and did not notify me of the change. I only discovered it when I started looking to see why it had not arrived today, the day that was posted as the delivery date all week long. And customer service was a joke. An apology and an offer of $2.95 adjustment! I requested cancellation and refund but they said I have to wait for the order to arrive, refuse it, and they keep my money until the return gets back to them! So if the order doesn't arrive for another week I still don't get my money. I'm at their mercy. I purchase online a lot but I cannot ever remember feeling as unappreciated. And I don't remember another seller not trying to solve my problem. Walmart doesn't get it. A big part of the reason I ordered from them is the date the items were confirmed to arrive. My problem is not that I need a discount. My problem isn't solved with an apology. I need what I ordered. Nothing fixes this other than getting my items to me or refunding so I can purchase elsewhere."
2648,47103,Mrsz Rivero,14/05/2018,Walmart,"I ordered a package from walmart.com, a 50 inch tv. The package was left on my porch and stolen. I spoke to the customer service department and they were absolutely NOT helpful. The supervisor Norma informed me that I had to go out of my way to fill out a police report for further assistance.....I will NEVER shop at walmart again. The experience was horrible. Now on top of me spending more money on a Mother's Day gift because I didnt recieve my package, I have to take extra time to go to the police report so my issue can be resolved."
2649,46768,ColoradoLuke,14/05/2019,Walmart,"I just got off a chat with Walmart.com customer service and have to warn everyone about their ineptitude. I ordered an ""e"" birthday gift card for my grandson on walmart.com, 2 days before his birthday. I was in the UK and he lives in Colorado so I couldn't be there. He loves to buy toys at the local Walmart store, so thought this is the perfect long-distance gift. The card was to be delivered via email to my daughter's account. We've done this many times before successfully with other websites like Amazon.  The Walmart.com website said the card was delivered about 4 hours after I placed the order. But my daughter never received it. She's very tech-savvy and knows about Junk and Spam and how to find stuff. We waited and waited, and after two days, still no card. So I was forced to buy another gift.  The next day I contacted Customer ""Care"" (ha-ha) via the Chat tool. The nice agent told me that she would resend the gift card email. I said, no thanks, a bit late I already bought something else and just want a refund. Since it wasn't delivered, surely you can just cancel the card number. No we can't, she replied. But I'll escalate this to our gift card team who will contact you in 48 hours.  They never contacted me. So I tried again. The very nice agent this time said we don't ever give refunds on gift card purchases. But she'd be glad to resend the gift card. Again, no that's not what we want. We want a refund. Or we'd settle for a voucher we could use on the website again. So she sends us a voucher good for the gift card amount. but it says we first have to spend an additional $45 at Walmart! Unbelievable.  I ask, can you change the email address and just send the card to me, maybe I can use it. She says, sorry we cannot change the email address after the order. Wow.  So here is why you should never buy an e-gift card from Walmart.com: 1. If it's not delivered or received, you have no recourse. You're screwed. End of story. 2. Delivering an e-card today is such a simple operation at every other website. But something is wrong with the Walmart.com system and they're not admitting it. I'm not the first to complain. 3. Their Customer Service chat tool is strange, compared to others. Firstly, there are no time stamps anywhere. I guess so you can't tell how long you've waited or been on with them. 2nd, there is no way to Print or Save a transcript of the chat. I had to manually copy and paste. Why doesn't Walmart want us to save a copy of the chat?? 4. If you are angry enough, they will try to buy you off with a coupon that requires you to spend more money in order to get your refund! That's insulting.  Shoulda bought from Amazon."
2650,45245,mar,14/05/2020,Walmart,I bought an EXPENSIVE ride on for my son from Terrace Walmart and he only used it TWICE and it stopped working. NOT happy. I do not recommend buying from Walmart.
2651,45246,Linda Brzak,14/05/2020,Walmart,Will not go there again! Way too many people NOT wearing masks. Store needs to make it a policy or can't go in. Nit hard to do if Walmart is really co concerned about their customers.
2652,45247,Rita Galeas,14/05/2020,Walmart,"I love Walmart so much! Walmart is the best, thank you for keeping their prices competitive to other supermarkets, and have good stuff, they are very good in customer service and is easy to shop online or in person."

2654,45249,T. Enos,14/05/2020,Walmart,"Tried to order a Acade1up machine as a birthday gift for a friend. I live in CT and he lives in NY. Ordered it online, got a confirmation and then about 10 minutes later a ""Walmart has Canceled your order"" email. I guess the website on the phone duplicated the shipping address as my billing and even though my credit card okay'd it Walmart didn't. Okay, your web site on the iphone sucks. Let's move to the computer.  Second time, used the computer, ensured the delivery and billing addresses were correct, submitted it, 5 minutes later same Walmart has canceled your order email. Lets try calling them to fix the order.  Called the company, went for the call back 1 hour 45 minutes later (I get it, it's busy right now with everything going on). Got the call back, guy I talked to was nice but he couldn't help, said it was because I did not use that specific credit card at Walmart.com before... Escalated it to someone else who said they overrode the system and I had to order it again after 30 minutes and within an hour and it will absolutely go through.  40 minutes later....Third time is a charm right...no way, submitted the order, correct addresses everything, 5 minutes later, Walmart has canceled my order. Needless to say, I am all set. If they couldn't get it right after 3 tries I am moving on. Target was no problem and price matched it - Done with Walmart Online and BUYER BEWARE.  Now I'll wait and see if the three pending charges on my credit card for $350 a piece disappear or not."
2655,36448,Nik K.,14/05/2018,Amazon Go,This was a fun experience to try out! I didn't realize how small the actual store was but everything was calculated correctly and we were in and out within 5 minutes without checking out.
2656,43188,Juan,14/05/2021,Walmart,"I purchased a pack of 6 hair products and only received 5, I contacted Walmart via the chat feature only to later be emailed stating that I was shipped the correct amount. Hey Walmart, Iâ€™m frugal but not a thief which is more than I can say for you!"
2657,43189,Pretty Fly,14/05/2021,Walmart,"I bought 2 TVs but got a broken TV and a baby gate.  I don't know how this can happen in modern e-commerce with barcodes and such.  The first thing is that the one TV arrived with a broken display. The second TV came as the wrong item. Ok, you might think I'm overly dramatic. Stay tuned, and there is more.  So I went on their website, contacted customer support to get my TV switched for a baby gate (wrong item). At this time, I didn't even unpack the other TV, so I didn't know it was damaged (I bought it for my rental). The customer support lady told me they're sending a replacement my way, and I was like, daaam, Amazon has competition right there. Well, no, actually, I got an email from Walmart (which I skipped because the lady said they're sending a replacement) that stated that I needed to return my item first. Okay, that makes sense, but I wouldn't have waited 7 days to do it. But ok, my bad, so I did turn in the post office. And voila, another 7 days goes by, still no sign of my replacement item. So I contact support again, and they have no f-ing clue what's going on and can't help me. They're actually asking me to call USPS and check with them the status of the item I dropped. (reminder: They sent me the wrong item).  Alright, so I ignore that problem for a while and install the one TV that I got to my rental and then SURPRISE!! Broken screen. Alright, this time I contact support. I don't want a replacement; I want a refund. But this time, I read an email, and it says I need to return my item first to get a refund. Now I am at the point where I don't know what I should do because the one item I returned still hasn't been received, and naturally, I didn't get my replacement. Then how am I expected to send this as a return when the same thing can happen.  Hopefully, if you lasted by now, you understand that I'm not overly dramatic. I hope, and I pray to God someone will read this and not buy at Walmart.com. Just do yourself a favor, pay a tiny bit extra at Amazon, and just enjoy the experience. Both buying and returning. I regret the day I decided to buy at Walmart. It cost me money, time spent with stupid support people, and I am still not done with them at the end of the day.  PLEASE DONT IGNORE THIS"

I went in to see if I could pick it up early at 10:30 am and the lady said it was in the back that I would have to wait for them to retrieve it and it would be a little after 12:00 pm, while I sat in your parking lot from that time till 12:10 pm they stated that they sent me an email telling me it was cancelled that the inventory was wrong. I looked at my email and at 11:24 am they cancelled the order after they told me it was in the back and I was sitting outside. This is very unprofessional!"

2662,43194,Karen,14/05/2021,Walmart,"I really did not want to give it any stars at all. My daughter had just got her wisdom teeth pulled and went to get prescription filled and she could not have been treated more rude. She was told it was not called in yet and when my daughter called the Dr he said it was called in but they were terrible about checking their messages. When my daughter told them that, they refused to check their messages and we stood there for 20 minutes until I lost my temper and ask if anyone was going to take care of this. My daughter stood there in tremendous pain (never complained) and the man said rudely to me, that he was taking care of it. I took my daughter out of there and they were suppose to text her but never did. She had to call hours later to find out it was filled. Never again will I use their services!! This was the Adrian Michigan Pharmacy"
2663,43195,CL,14/05/2021,Walmart,I will never work with Walmart.com ever again. Not only does 1 of out 4 tires get lost the customer service is TERRIBLE and not willing to go above and beyond in helping fix the problem.
2664,43196,Meg,14/05/2021,Walmart,I ordered storage bins online on March 22. It was supposed to be available for pickup April 9. I have contacted the chat support 5 times and 5 times been told the situation has been escalated. Iâ€™ve tried cancelling and requesting a refund but was told that couldnâ€™t happen the first 4 times. The most recent time the CS rep told me I would receive a refund within 2-3 business days. 1 week later I received an email saying I never responded so the issue is considered â€œresolvedâ€. This is ridiculous...itâ€™s been two months... just give me my money back we donâ€™t need the bins to move anymore.
2665,43206,Richard Paverd,14/05/2021,Walmart,"Ordered a new Apple AirTag online for pickup on May 2nd. Notified of delay - which is undestandable for a new product. On 3rd May notified of further delay until 6th of May. Checked online and STILL out of stock. Obviously a bait and switch approach on the basis that they will sell everything to the first available customer... And then they have the gall to send out a request for me to review the product! On completing the review - showing my displeasure at the lack of customer service - the website threw an error stating ""try again later"" possibly it rejects all negative reviews automatically? On contacting ""Customer Service"" department, they stated that I should go to the store or that they would be happy to cancel the order for me... ! Maybe they should change their name to ""Customer Disservice Department""? UPDATE: Within 6 hours of submitting this review I received an email that my device was available for pickup - and the curbside pickup experience was decent. But really, does one have to go to these extremes just to get something from Walmart?"
2666,40650,Casey,14/05/2022,Walmart,"I ordered Batman begins this last Monday. It originally said it would be here the next day. Since then it has bounced around multiple times from Thursday, to Friday, to Saturday, back to Thursday, and back to Saturday. This is crazy. The only reason I ordered from Walmart was because before I purchased, I was told it would be here the next day. Yesterday (Thursday) I was parked outside of game world after work ready to head in and pick up this product for myself since I cannot realistically tell when it will be here from Walmart but one check of my Walmart app later and it says my product will be delivered later that day. I went home not wanting to have paid for this product twice to have it show up hours later. Not only did it not show up but It wonâ€™t be showing up today either. The ONLY reason I ordered this from Walmart was because it was expected to be in my possession 4 days ago. I will be headed out today for another trip to get this product I should have gone out for myself anyways. I expect a full refund once I do and will be taking the correct steps through Walmart to get it. Will never ever order online through Walmart again and I donâ€™t recommend anybody else do either.  Edit: game showed up Saturday with a broken box. Disk was fine and playable but now I have a broken box to add to my shelf. Without sending the game itself back there is no option of refund. Stay away from ordering packages off of Walmart."

2668,47192,GaryTheBadger,15/05/2017,Walmart,"I worked at the Walmart Home Office for six years in a white-collar management position. Glad to be employed BUT way too conservative for me, it interfered with my ability to be myself and contribute the most possible. I was actually asked by a second-level manager not to ask so many questions!! And I was told to change a report value that was $666k, because of someone's superstition! And the lay-off process is for six-year-old's, rather than adults who would continue contributing after being notified. Instead, we're immediately walked to the door for the last time, hand over your badge, you'll get your personal belongings later."

But since we are the third party seller on Walmart, we are afraid that you need to return the products to our own warehouse and pay for the shipping.   The returning might be troublesome and the shipping is expensive. And Walmart allows sellers to charge a restocking fee of up to 20% for returns.  To save you time and energy, what do you think we offer you total US$10 refund of the order and you keep the product please?   Waiting for your reply.  Regards.  (This is terrible 3rd party business for faithful walmart customers. I am afraid to even attempt to send the Item back because after I finally read the reviews on the Kwanshop website, I read that a lot of people never got their refund, and so they dont have the Item and they didnt get a refund.

I asked him if it could be loaded with a fork lift ,he said no but there would be ample help to load 68 bags of wet mulch. After talking to him I went to the store around 6:30 pm and was told the garden dept was closed and I would have to come back another day. 5-15 8 am I arrived at the store 35 min to check out then waited for help to arrive to help load the 1st pallet. Back at the store at 10am for the 2nd pallet 30 min check out , no help!!!! loaded all by myself, nobody ever checked the load out , no help anywhere, If I was not honest ????? store is in trouble with the help walking around playing with their phones and not doing what they are being paid to do, I have run my own business for 37 years and to me this is just bad management from the top down .

Today I talk to two representatives both are ridiculous, don't know how to treat customers, none of them helped me. if we are placing an order for curbside pick up then why are you charging $5 for product handling. Moreover, why do you put the minimum requirement of $35 for grocery pick up? I do not have an option for negative that's why I had to select one star, but believe me, your service is below zero.ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž"

I said no at least 7 times that day to the same employee and she insisted on taking my information and setting the card up so I said whatever, if it will make her leave me alone about it. She made it CLEAR AS DAY that the first purchase is FREE. I got out my debit card and I was still ready to pay but she said â€œNO ITS FREE, you use this as a points cardâ€ basically made it sound like an optimum card with shoppers. Long story short, I now have a past due balance on my account from 5 months ago, and the card was never mailed to me."

They refunded my money and increased the price. When I confronted them, they claimed that they are out of stock and this item would be a third party seller, and they could not modify the price. I got this answer after several hours of several agents lying to me about it being out of stock and then in stock at another store and then out of stock again. I lose count as to what they said as it changed every 5 minutes. One agent actually ended our conversation with me still talking. Another just wanted to ignore me.

But for the last two years their customer service from the floor all the way to the cashiers has gone to be a horrible place to shop. On the floor if you ask for help, no one can coz they claim the belong to other departments no matter which one you need the help on. Then when you find some that is willing to help they have no knowledge about their floor products, so then they cannot help coz lack of product and floor items knowledge. Most of every one has an attitude and want to treat you like a child. They get loud and obnoxious. Then I looking for products made in USA, and very few. Good luck most of their merchandise is MADE IN â€œCHINA ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³â€œ low quality junk that donâ€™t last. No wounded the late polls categorized WALL MART AS THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR For SHOPPING STORES! I drive a long ways to TARGET and my gosh, is LIKE DAY And NIGHT SHOPPING EXPERIENCE.

2685,43187,Patrick McCroskey,15/05/2021,Walmart,"I am slow to learn, sometimes. Everytime I make an order on Walmart.com the same thing happens. I get a notification it is on it's way (sometimes they even claim it is early). I am directed to FedEx tracking and the package says out for delivery and arriving that day. That will be the case all day even though the departure and arrival scans are not updating. Then, right before delivery deadline, the status will change to pending, no longer saying that it will be delivered that day or even WHEN it will be delivered. Then, after that, there are calls to FedEx where they say its not their fault followed by customer service calls to Walmart where they say its not their fault. This continues a few days and then I finally get a notification that the order was canceled due to being out of stock. This has happened to me no less than 5 times. It is ridiculous.

2690,45234,Chuck,16/05/2020,Walmart,"One star is actually one too many. I ordered on April 30 fro Walmart a Resistance Band Set for $33.99 with free shipping, prior to payment told my order would arrive on 4 May 2020, after checkout it changed to 8 May 2020 and it was coming from a vendor not Walmart US Prime Technology. On 01 May 2020 I received shipping confirmation from Fremont CA with tracking number that it had shipped. It is now 16 May 2020 and I have not received it and the order delivery has not been updated. I sent a message to Walmart help line on 13 May and 15 May, each time Walmart robot responded email with a US AMPRIME Technology would respond within one business day and the US AMPRIME Technology has not responded. I blame Walmart on this as Walmart is who I placed this order with, they do not respond to me other than ROBO emails. Walmart's policy is once an item ships the order cannot be canceled. So technically my order has shipped even though it apparently only moved once on May 1st and never again since, Checking reviews online for US AMPRIME Technology finds a pattern of similar complaints, orders reported shipped to one location then not moving again. Again I ordered form Walmart, that was the website and reviews I read for the product, At this point I consider my money stolen by an online scheme that one of the worlds biggest companies is part of. Never going to shop online with Walmart again."

The manager came and see the whole situation and was sorry and promised to compensate. I went to the cash and as usual,and I paid my bill. A week later the insurance company called me and investigated the situation and then they found out that they were not responsible and the manufacture is . I also had to wait for the manufacturer investigation who also found irresponsible. The case end up dismissed and Walmart didn't take any responsibility not even an apology. Very poor customer service, they don't care about their customers no such think called customer loyalty, and very poor complaint handling procedure."

I'm sure management knows about this but they are not going to do anything about it, it happens too frequently and would use up too much of their resources. The shopping environment has become uncomfortable and there is too much potential for conflicts with other male shoppers. I have seen a lot of crazy things and it's getting worse by the day."

2700,40647,Mathew Rucker,16/05/2022,Walmart,I hate shopping at Walmart since the over nights have stopped. There are always to many people in there and customer service sucks.
2701,47163,tyson2222,17/05/2019,Walmart,"Do not buy any 3rd party product from WALMART.COM. I purchased few 3rd party products from WALMART.COM, They will not accept any return at Walmart store other than (3rd party seller) Walmart selling in WALMART.COM. Please make sure it sells by Walmart or 3rd party seller. 3rd party sellers are selling Chinese craps and no quality at all, but they describe its a high quality product, but its never. Walmart.com customer service also very bad, they connect to the 3rd party seller and never involve in to the real problems. 3rd parties are really bad in business you have to pay return shipping and they never give your money back, please stay away and make sure selling by Walmart."
2702,45225,John Huff,17/05/2020,Walmart,went to Walmart to buy 2 batteries for my pickup and took old batteries with me for cores. was told I could not use the batteries for cores as they were not purchased at Walmart. Needless to say I will no longer due business with Wally World again. So Walmart lost over $200 sale today and all of my future business
2703,45226,Rachel,17/05/2020,Walmart,So I was shopping at Walmart today the one at the one on Niles on Touhy and I was walking down the aisle and I accidentally went down the wrong way I guess and one of the vendors with I believe was the vendor or an employee who work there said hey you're going the wrong way and I said oh I'm sorry and he goes I don't want to get sick and I was like well. Nobody wants to get sick I'm wearing a mask and you're wearing a mask and he was very very rude if you are that paranoid then get fired and stay home for unemployment this was very disappointing
2704,45227,Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Phuong,17/05/2020,Walmart,"The customer service was very bad, I ordered it on Walmart for 5 weeks ago but didn't get it, they just let it be late but didn't say how long I had to wait, I sent a letter to customer service but they did not answer just an automated message from the machine, I called early in the morning to wait for 45 minutes for the phone and they turned off my phone, I just wanted to know how long to wait and if they would send it to me otherwise then they need to send the money back but they don't answer and tell me, Walmart customer care is very bad, I do not want to give them 1 star. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž! If anyone is intending to buy goods online from Walmart, then be careful."
2705,45228,Diamond,17/05/2020,Walmart,"I donâ€™t understand why Walmart has things online then say they canâ€™t ship the item. If I have to go to the store whatâ€™s the point of me ordering online? Itâ€™s just really silly. If you can ship red lipstick why would their be a problem shipping a different shade? Canâ€™t ship paper towels, or nothing. Itâ€™s getting really ridiculous. It was bad to begin with. I itâ€™s just worse! Btw stop pushing your prices up on items. The owners should be ashamed of themselves."
2706,45229,Will,17/05/2020,Walmart,"I bought a $3,000 Sony A7R-iv online from Walmart. They took the money out of my paypal account, then when I called on the ordered it had been cancelled. The 3rd Party camera store who was selling the item said they never got the order from Walmart. They took 5 days before putting the money back into my account. Calling into them never helped. I literally waited 1 hour only to tel my story to a lady in India who then put me into â€œhigher departmentâ€ which took another hour only to have the call disconnected. This is a true story. My name is Will Brown and I live in Iowa. Do not buy from Walmart online. Beware........."
2707,45230,Michael J,17/05/2020,Walmart,"tv ordered for Mother day worst customer service ever. the first agent stated lost in transit, second tried to convince no stock, even though there was online at the time of order. the refund issued without confirmation from me. no chat rating settings or save transcript of the chat.  utter waste of time. worst customer service, shop elsewhere."
2708,45231,Mike Hinton,17/05/2020,Walmart,Purchased item to be picked up at store. They couldnâ€™t find my order and when they did after I was already their they cancelled the main item on my order. Itâ€™s the last straw with Walmart Iâ€™m done with their lousy customer service and the online ordering. Amazon puts them to shame
2709,43170,Nunaya Bznss,17/05/2021,Walmart,"WALMART (Plainfield Illinois) employee ruined my Mitsubishi. (Over $537.00 in DAMAGE!!!) Needed two tires replaced. They had a deal on tires. DO NOT HAVE THEM REPLACE YOUR TIRES!! The imbecile had the pneumatic-drill on ""tighten"" instead of ""loosen"" and stripped two of the bolts on the driver's side wheel. They never installed the tires either, obviously. He sent my bother home in my car ( ho brought it in for me) with 2 broken bolts, and other 3 bolts loose! The wheel almost fell off!!  Then to top it all off, their ""Home_Office/ Claims-Dept."" reviewed the footage of their garage and apparently, the imbecile was clever enough to pull out the vehicle then start over an hour later, adjusting the time-code or something on the work order. So the Claims department couldn't review the footage of him ruining my car! Another worker verified the damage and explained what caused the damage. The store-manager acted rude and didn't want to help. $537.00 in damages (1 ALLOY RIM, ROTOR, BOLTS, LUGNUTS and I forget what else. and I had to pay someone else to install the tires WALFART was supposed to do free with tires. And I was without my car while car was waiting for replacement parts."
2710,43171,ilistitu,17/05/2021,Walmart,They don't care about disabled people at all! Went there today and no electric carts. I had surgery and shouldn't be walking the store. I had to push a cart and almost fell. Last time I was there the only cart they had died half way through the store. There's no excuse! Buy more carts (they only have about 3) and keep some charged before someone gets hurt and SUES YOU. This was at the Walmart in Fremont Michigan.
2711,43172,Mike Klatter,17/05/2021,Walmart,I bought a 55inch LG tv from ScagMart and about six weeks it went out well with ScagMart out of TVs because of the microchip shortage i decided to wait till they had more TVs in stock they only had like 50 inch and smaller I was hard to find one but then today they had all kinds of TVs 65 and bigger so I brought it in only for them to tell me that the store return is only good for 30 days but when I call ScagMart Corporate office that's when I found out about the chip shortage she told me I had 90 days to return has any one tried to find the return policy on TVs at (ScagMart)Walmart you can't find it it's not there it says return of 90 days but it doesn't explain on what so it don't matter they screwed me once again ( ScagMart )WalMart
2712,43173,Zeke Shortes,17/05/2021,Walmart,"I bought an air mattress two weeks ago, opened it up only to find the wrong air mattress and no pump in the box. I was just trying to replace it with a box that had the right air mattress and pump in it. The air mattress in there is a single very cheap quality air mattress. I bought $150 queen air mattress with dual pumps in it. They did not have any replacement units and refuse to give me my money back. I spoke with Daniel, allegedly the GM, and he would not even investigate why they have a box with the wrong air mattress in it. I don't think I have ever even tried to return something to Walmart prior to this. I will never buy anything in your store again"
2713,43174,Mario J Antoun,17/05/2021,Walmart,"I ordered many items since the delivery is free for orders above 35$. When checking out, I was charged a delivery fee of 8$. I called customer service and I was told that once I receive my order this fee can be waved. When I called again, they told me that this fee cannot be waved. In addition to that, the only item that I really needed wasn't available so they cancelled it for me. And finally, there is an item with a status delivered but I didn't get anything. I will NEVER order again nor refer it to anyone. I will make sure to post my experience and social media and share how BAD is your service is with everyone."
2714,43175,Rick Flammia,17/05/2021,Walmart,I ordered a 65inch flat screen TV from Wal-Mart.Com it was a great tv at a great price so I purchased it. It offered free shipping as a tv that big wont fit in my car. Nightmare begins TV is 2 days sitting around the house late. Then I finally get the TV delivered on the sidewalk no signature required whole in the side of the box. I take it in plug it power it up its smashed! No TV ! Never again deal with a poorly planned company.
2715,40643,Jessica McPherson,17/05/2022,Walmart,"I got the Walmart plus membership at the end of last year and have had nothing but trouble with the delivery and customer service at the Walmart at metro phoenix az. There has not been one time that something isn't missing that I ordered or incorrect items (not substitutions) such as deli ham being ordered but turkey being delivered instead. I have on many occasions received items with another customers name sticker on the bag. Once my order went to the wrong address and they just cancelled it all together making it so that I had to wait 7 days for a refund rather than correcting and delivering. Last sunday I made a large order of $430 and paid express shipping for it to be delivered in 2 or less hours. should have been here by 6pm latest. When I did the customer service chat they called and no one answered. They asked if I wanted a refund and I said no, I dont want the funds being held for a week just put a note to have it delivered tomorrow. The next day the store canceled the order and funds are being held anyway. So two days later I attempt again and put in a $270 order the day before and in the morning its late and says delayed delivery. I call the store and get hung up on at customer service a few times before someone finally puts me on hold for about 10 mins then gets me to a manager, Kristin, and she checks into it and says she will text me from her personal phone so I can get updates. Never does this which is fine just bs. Calls me back to say it will be here at 11am. It is now 1:34pm and the store keeps hanging up on me, I contact customer service at the main walmart 800 number where they cant get through"
2716,40644,leah aragon,17/05/2022,Walmart,"I refuse to buy anymore clothes from Walmart.com. They have too many Chinese suppliers and every item I've gotten from China is does not fit, extremely poor quality and trying to return this stuff is impossible. China is laughing at us."
2717,47188,Andrea Eviolet Toledo,18/05/2017,Walmart,"First attempt the postal carrier received a request to send back the item to Walmart the day it was supposed to be delivered. Same day called and was told that it would be cancelled, reordered and expedited w/o additional costs. 5 days later no tracking number received. Chatted with customer service again and they said there was an error on their part in regard to their processing system. Once again i had the order cancelled, reordered, expedited and receiving a 10% discount. Next day the new order did not populate on my account. Had to chat with them again and the rep was being cold and had to repeat many things. Then claims that no order was made and I wouldn't receive the item b/c its cancelled and no 10% discount. Lastly gave the excuse that the item was out of stock."
2718,47189,Karen L,18/05/2017,Walmart,Walmart you really should not sell main stay sheets in your store and online. They are full of electricity and a tremendous amount of lint that will not come out even after lint rolling or shaking out. Lint causes major headaches. I will always shop at Walmart and Walmart.com but I will never buy main stay sheets again.
2719,47190,Roman Ebbs,18/05/2017,Walmart,Great prices but poor customer service from my experience.

2721,45217,God Love Me,18/05/2020,Walmart,"At Walmart store, there was this cashier lady watching all the self check out machines. She was standing so close behind me watching over my shoulder. Please tell her to practice SOCIAL DISTANCING."
2722,45218,alpapd Lee,18/05/2020,Walmart,"6 individual bottles of TeaTree oil rolling around loosely in the box with a piece of plastic included. No protection for the bottles at all. Terrible. Terrible I say!  We had to search for the package because the driver never rang the door-bell nor was any attempt made to notify us. We finally located the package in our United States Postal Service Mail-box. Terrible. Terrible I say. Walmart, the Walmart supervisor and employee responsible for this order gets a definite triple grading score of F! The delivery by FedEx gets an F as well for putting order in mailbox. Lazy, Lazy, Lazy!"
2723,45219,Justin Hardesty,18/05/2020,Walmart,"Every time I think I have lowered the bar enough to shop at Walmart, they still manage to disappoint. Terrible customer service, somehow in this day in age they still manage to have the worst shipping to store and least helpful customer service (both in store and online). And I seriously hate how they make it feel like I am inconveniencing them in store just by asking questions. It's my own fault at this point I guess..."
2724,45221,Ronaldo Fisher,18/05/2020,Walmart,"I went to the Super Walmart on Byberry rd.,Philadelphia. I requested to speak to a Manager because two days in a row customers service was closed. I met with Manager Aletheia, she was so professional and helpful and she resolved my problem Forget five stars, I give her ten stars."
2725,45222,Jack Harbour,18/05/2020,Walmart,"Very disappointed with the Walmart.com website. I guess the old adage that you get what you pay for is true. I used the Walmart website for the first time to order a printer, it was shipped by a third party. I truly had no issues with the process. However, more recently, I ordered an appliance. Over the span of 3 weeks I have not been able to reach the company, and it appears that Walmart has not been able to do so either. The number they list for this seller ""has a voicemail that has not been set up."" I am very disappointed with the ""hands off"" approach Walmart seems to be taking with this. If you are going to sell products from a third party via your website you would think they'd want to hold them to a higher standard, or at least facilitate cancelling your order in cases where it appears the item will truly not ship."
2726,45223,Jasper Sp,18/05/2020,Walmart,Walmart on line is horrible. You don't get what you ordered and there is no recourse other than a credit card dispute. These days they are one of the few major companies not answering the customer service telephone.
2727,45224,elsaghorton,18/05/2020,Walmart,Itâ€™s a beautiful website. Thank you for sharing products at cheap price.
2728,43160,Isa Escobar,18/05/2021,Walmart,"Very rude associate, i was just minding my own business, on my phone while waiting for my uber after i just spent over $100 at your store, while she was smoking a cigarette which mind you is disgusting, and she tells me to lower the volume and gives me faces. I have a picture of her I would love to submit if you gave me a link to submit it in cause I dont see where I am able to. If someone is able to smoke this disgusting cigarette in front of ME, a customer !! While i wait for my uber i should be allowed to watch a video while i wait. highly distrubing, unprofessional, and rude! She should be fired. Extremely rude."
2729,43161,Emma Papadopoulos,18/05/2021,Walmart,"I was looking to order a laptop through Walmart. My order had been cancelled and I did not know why. I called Walmart's customer service and a gentleman named Sid answered the phone and gave me very quick and polite service and helped me figure out how to navigate the issue. I would like to commend Sid, the general manager, and this location: 2190 Rymal Rd E, Hannon ON L0R 1P0. Thank you Sid for your help and your great attitude. I am grateful to this location for quickly transferring my calls, being so friendly, and helping me resolve this issue!"
2730,43162,Tina Pirtle,18/05/2021,Walmart,You can pretty much return anything these days without a receipt. My daughter grab the wrong pizza crust and all I wanted to do was exchange what I needed of course she threw the receipt away and im force to throw away something won't eat or use...
2731,43163,CJ Mai,18/05/2021,Walmart,"both the website and app are so glitchy and not operateble in Canada, the online shopping experience is horrible, I think whoever responsible for the online shopping experience should be fired as they made it look like worse than ever third-world website"

2733,43165,murray roffe,18/05/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a swing set from Walmart and it should have been delivered on May 6th. Called and then was told it would be delivered on May 12th. They wrote to me to set up a time and I stayed home and they never showed up or called. Then they said it would be delivered on May 17th but never showed up. When trying to call them no one could help me. They simply put me or explain what was going on,. I called their main corporate headquarters and they claim they couldn't help me since it was .com. I even called the company Kidskraft and they just re directed me back to walmart.  Sam Walton would not be happy with their .com business . I am a wholesaler and deal with major retailers but I would strongly suggest not to buy anything from Walmart.com. The very worse customer service ever."
2734,43166,latonya williams,18/05/2021,Walmart,Order the item on the 30th Walmart said it supposed to be delivered on the 17th call Walmart on the 18th I was informed they went through a third-party third-party only printed out a label for my order never shipped out my order so if I wasnâ€™t to call Walmart about the issue I would know my order was never coming on the 17th

2736,43168,kenneth gordon,18/05/2021,Walmart,Now a whole bunch of people have a variety of different opinions when it comes to walmart. Now the supercenters where you can buy anything you want are awsome. i go to walmart and can either window shop for hours on end. Or go get a few things u need and be in and out i 15 minutes give or take. I think walmart is a destination that belongs everywhere.
2737,43169,BigJuiceDaddy,18/05/2021,Walmart,"Trash, called Walmart (510 Centennial Pkwy N, Hamilton, ON L8E 0G2) for 2ds xl 12 times because their website wasn't allowing any curbside pickups, and either no one picked up or they just sent me another number to call. I later placed an order for the 2ds but was disappointed to hear 4 hours later that they were out of stock, and when I checked back on the website it said they were still in stock."

2741,45207,Louise Ungro,19/05/2020,Walmart,"All Walmarts are not taking clothes back for refunds or exchanges, its been months since the first breakout of the China Covid 19 yet, customer service keeps refusing my refunds by repeating the same thing over and over.....its ""Walmart policy during the covid 19 pandemic to not allow any refunds or exchanges for clothing""....However, its been five months and beyond the crisis now and Walmart still refuses to refund or exchange clothing worse yet, these clothes were purchased without trying them on in store which was the first rule ""no one is allowed to try on clothing"" so it was a guessing game as to fit and style for ourselves and others we bought for, at this point it doesn't look good that we will ever get our money back. Walmart is too big a deal on our very lives, I feel they are bent on not ever returning back to normal again. Thank goodness for competition we can go elsewhere for food and clothing and other necessities which will help our businesses immensely to finally get their rightful place again since Walmart took over years ago and nearly wiped them out heartlessly by selling cheaper products mainly from China and didn't mind damaging smaller businesses across this country, they are still presently the largest importer of China goods. Shame on you Walmart."
2742,45208,Consumer,19/05/2020,Walmart,I ordered 3 gifts for my grand daughters bday on April 17th. Two of them were canceled and one has a a fed ex tracking number that does not work. I have called and used the online chat ( which is a joke). And still dont know where this gift for her bday which is tomorrow is at. I will not ever order from them again. I have been emailing since it missed its expected delivery date and nothing. You cant talk to a real person. Save your money and order from somewhere else.

Tried to call customer service but there is a 1 hour wait. Tried to use Chat but they don't respond. Maybe Walmart can attend some Amazon training classes.
2745,45211,Dale Capavanni,19/05/2020,Walmart,"My name is Philip Capavanni I live in Kearny NJ and shop at the Harrison store. Today I was lucky enough to run into an exceptional young man who was tending the self checkout. His name is Ronald Rosado, I made sure he spelled it for me so I could write and let you know what kind of employee he is. At around 3pm today while checking out I was paying with my bank card and got 100 dollars cash back. I'd forgotten to take my 100 dollars and left. I didn't realize it until hours later when I got a text from my bank. When I went back to Walmart to see if I could make some kind of report, figuring surely it was gone. To my surprise I found out he had secured it and given it to customer service. Today l was reminded there will always be those who do what's right."
2746,45212,Josh,19/05/2020,Walmart,"Ok this is for their website/app...it sucks. You would think a $514.405 billion dollar company would make a decent website...no, this is not the case. Itâ€™s very difficult to navigate. Half the time I just want to know if the product Iâ€™m looking for is at my store...good luck. They need to take some pointers from amazon or eBay."

2748,45214,Carolyn Dennison,19/05/2020,Walmart,"Almost 3 weeks ago I complained at the Colorado Springs Space Center Drive store that there was no wipes or sanitizer for carts or customers upon entering the store. Greeter said store was out but there was a standing roll of dry paper towels I could use. Who else touched that roll? Also that carts were sprayed outside with sanitizer, never touched. Upon leaving I watched a young man with a weed sprayer quickly walk up the line of carts, already pushed together. Few shoppers had masks. Tonight the news cites this store has infected employees. Iâ€™m 70 and go there weekly, no more!"
2749,45215,Donyale Johnson,19/05/2020,Walmart,I used to live in Hampstead NC and now in Wilmington NC. I had a local Walmart on Porters Neck which I loved to frequent shop there because the customer service was awesome. I moved in an area I thought was a nice area and I built a home there and the local Walmart is HORRIBLE. My daughter was visiting from college and we went there to shop and we were treated like thieves who was begging for bread. We had a cart full which we walked around for an hr to purchase after getting off work. A young man by the name of Frank was staring at us in the self check out while my daughter was scanning our purchases. He proceeded towards her due to a couple of wine coolers I was purchasing in the cart. He said are you purchasing those she said no they are my momâ€™s he said if you scan them you canâ€™t purchase them she said ok and moved out of my way to allow me to scan them. He comes over after I was done and stated that we canâ€™t purchase those now. I stated she didnâ€™t scan them I did he said she was scanning the groceries but she stopped when it got to the wine coolers he said to me as though I was a child I said you canâ€™t purchase those. Then a security guard who wouldnâ€™t give me his name came over and acted as though we were stealing and stood there. I told them I am not purchasing any of these items a manager came over and stated to me have a nice day without asking anything a short white man with classes who wouldnâ€™t allow me see his name and didnâ€™t introduce himself. I have never been so humiliated in my life and I will take a long drive to shop for other items and spend a little more not to be treated like that ever. I am a Director at a business and my daughter is a 3rd year college student and I really think this happened because we were BLACK! Walmart on Carolina Beach Road (HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE)
2750,45216,delia schenhiet,19/05/2020,Walmart,"I wanted to purchase a cricut and they were out so I asked them to check. they all said ""no we don't have them"" but wouldn't check. we called later and they said they had it. I'm so disappointed! they wouldn't even bother to walk back and check"
2751,36464,Bindu G.,19/05/2018,Amazon Go,"Amazon go was an amazing experience for me. The store piqued my curiosity long ago but I didn't get the opportunity to go that side. I finally stepped in without any assumptions. Firstly one has to download the amazongo app on their mobile for entry. I had already done that a while ago. It has a bar code which has to be scanned at the entry gate which slides you in with no issues. I walked around the store looking at the food, drinks, chocolates, etc they even have alcohol by the way. I had no intent to shop but I wanted to experience the shopping experience hence I picked a coconut water and simply walked out. I must be honest I did feel I was stealing . The app was updated about the sale and the value maybe within 5 Mins and that was it. It's simple and super cool in My opinion. I went on a saturday afternoon and the crowd was moderate but I have a hunch that it can be bad during evenings and also during the lunch hours on weekdays. Happy hassle and human free shopping people! Go try!"

I called walmart.com and fedex for days only to get the run around then finally 5-19-21 walmart.com broke the news to me that my order was lost. They also charged my credit card on 5-12-21. All I wanted was the truth which was to hard for walmart.com and fedex to do."

Now Iâ€™m told itâ€™s on back order with no specific timeframe for delivery. They should have told me this before taking my payment and wasting my time.  Called customer service three times and was routed to Central America, India, and the Philippines. My complaint is still unresolved. I just cancelled my order. A very crappy experience."

The prices are great, they are super inexpensive, the products are good quality most of the time. It's easy to get a refund if the product doesn't work or if it isn't what you expected it to be. The only issue with the site is some items are out of stock and you don't know when (or if) they will ever come back in stock.  Walmart delivers faster than Amazon does (sometimes on the very next day for certain items) and you don't have to pay Walmart for their service like you have to pay Amazon Prime. Just meet the minimum $35 threshold.  Grocery pickup is quick and convenient. I just find whatever food I want to buy, checkout and choose a time & day to pick it up. The only issue I have with it is some items are out of stock but they have good substitutes available. If you don't like the substitutes, you can just cancel them.  Online shopping is easy. The app works well, it never crashes or freezes.  Honestly, if I ever had a negative experience, it's usually almost always in store (not surprising). But this review is for the main Walmart.com site/app.  Overall, I have had a pleasant and easy experience using the site. And I have been a loyal customer for years."
2755,40640,GH,19/05/2022,Walmart,"When another online store let me down, Walmart saved my bacon by quickly shipping the items I needed for a birthday party. The items arrived in 2 days and were very well packaged, and I didn't even pay for shipping!"

No mower & after 3 days of calling & begging for a time only response I got was email saying I had to go to Fed Ex drop location hour away from my home. Waited 45 minutes to be told they couldn't find it. To avoid interest I had to pay for it in my credit card bill. Hours of wasted time & gas plus $536.00, tall grass & no mower."
2757,47338,Andrew Louis,20/05/2014,Walmart,Walmart has some fast shipping time. I like the ease of use on their website and how fast it was it find the product that I wanted. They also have a layaway program that'll help save an item for you at the store location. Very helpful.. best prices all around.
2758,47187,Jonathan,20/05/2017,Walmart,"Like everyone is saying the 2 day shipping is false. Was hoping this would be another place to shop & get fast free shipping but guess not, I had guaranteed Delivery by Today & it was rescheduled to tomorrow & they couldn't do anything because ""it already shipped"" The order was split into separate shipments for some reason, the 1st part which I needed today, shipped first but is not on time! the part 2, which I didn't need soon, came hours after it shipped! DO NOT use Walmart if you need something by 2 days it will most likely not arrive!"
2759,47101,John Fitzmaurice,20/05/2018,Walmart,Every time I have looked for something they have it without exaggeration. There clearances are very good prices.

2761,45191,Grouchy Dude,20/05/2020,Walmart,"The Walmart in Napa Ca is run by idi*ts! I ordered a Scoob lights and sound at was instructed by the website to pick it up at Napa,Ca Walmart. I presented my bar code and a DynoMutt plushie comes out. I asked for help and some an Asian lady at the checkout literallys says, ""I dunno know..."" I stared at her for a minute until I see a light bulb shine over her head and she says, ""Maybe I can find help for you...."" She then asks another employee who then procededs to get someone to help me. At the pickup kiosk, the employee comes over to me and says ""I don't know..."" with a dumb look on her face. She then procedes to tell me that because I ordered online, i need to contact someone online and get a refund. I ask her, ""Someone in your store loaded the kiosk and put in the wrong order.."" She looked confused. Because I was only charge $7 or so and I had my 2 kids with me, I didn't feel I needed to make a scene for so little money so I left. I don't care about the money or my order not being fulfilled. What I hate the most is the sheer incompetence in that store! I know you don't need an education to work there, but at least get competent people who do custome service. I'm never, EVER shopping there again. I will either go to Safeway or Costco for my grocery needs."
2762,45192,cesar,20/05/2020,Walmart,"I am only giving one star because that's the lowest I can give. I don't know which of their service to name WORST First. WELL let me be fair THE ONLY THING THEY ARE GOOD AT IS CHARGING YOUR CREDIT CARD. When I contacted them for first time to find out where part of my order was, a representative from some where in ASIA not in the US let me know it was out of stock. Why to send something incomplete unless you want to upset customer. Why one has to contact a third party if I purchased thru WALMART.com. Getting my money back is a mission. I also had to print returning label thru USPS. Take the heavy box on top of scale cuz they could not do it at post office among some other headaches this order cuz me. Thanks Walmart for teaching me a lesson. NEVER EVER AIGAN."

2764,45194,Joseph Locke,20/05/2020,Walmart,"I ordered a white board from Walmart. After they charged my credit card and sent me a notification that it has shipped, it did not arrive. When I finally made contact (they are â€œreceiving an unexpectedly high volume of callsâ€) they gave me a refund, as if it wasnâ€™t their problem that the product hadnâ€™t been delivered. Unfortunately, I needed the item and have waited 10 days for delivery. Now I am stuck without a way to get one in time for my presentation. Stay away from Walmart.com!! They are neither reliable or responsive."
2765,45195,Dre Robinson,20/05/2020,Walmart,"Walmart needs to bring on some chick fil A hiring personel because the people they're hiring today is just terrible. Door greeters don't greet because they're too busy texting. Sales associates can't even tell you were the bathrooms are, even though I'm sure they use them quit often. And when you ask someone a simple question like: excuse me, could you tell me where peanut butter is? They turn around slowly like they wanna punch you in the face for doing the job they get paid for. Crazy! Don't think about asking for a manager, chances are the associate you want to complain about are close friends with manager. So nothings going to change. I went in Tuesday for new releases on dad's as always and the associate I asked never answered she just pointed to the manager next to her, I guess her voice box was disconnected. The manager saw her response and simply said: oh yeah they ""might"" be up front. Okay thankx for nothing."
2766,45196,Harry k,20/05/2020,Walmart,"Ordered cooking oil from walmart that i needed the next weekend. Website said 1 day shipping. The item was lost in shipping. Contacted customer service, they said they would cancel the order. I went to the store and bought the item I needed there. Walmart then ships a replacement of the missing items and bills me. Later the missing shipment shows up and walmart sends and email that they are rebilling me for it unless I call them... I will never do buisness with them again. Why do I have to just through hoops for their mistakes... the $100 isn't worth my time to wait on hold to fix their mistakes. Amazon treats customers better."
2767,45197,Renee,20/05/2020,Walmart,"I would rate zero stars if I could. Their customer service is the WORST I have ever experienced in over 30 years and I will NEVER buy from them again. When you call their customer service you have at a minimum over an hour WAIT TIME, then you get transferred again and again for each time OVER AN HOUR HOLD,they will not give you any identifier that links your conversation back to a person - no ID NUMBER - only First name and Last Name initial which is NO HELP when you have a problem. They made a typo in my email but will NOT Fix it nor forward the email the right address. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM - THEIR C/S IS NON EXISTENT i COULD NOT BE MORE FRUSTRATED AND SPENT OVER 5 HOURS FIXING THEIR PROBLEMS - AND IS IS NO EXAGGERATION. THE MOST MADDENING EXPERIENCE. DO NOT USE COVID AS AN EXCUSE NOT TO DO YOUR JOB. SHAME ON WALMART .."
2768,45198,Al Carr,20/05/2020,Walmart,"Received my order on time. However, there is no information on their site to assist on how to obtain a refund on broken glass food containers. So, now I am out the amount I paid for the broken items that cannot be shipped back."
2769,45199,sandra k,20/05/2020,Walmart,Such poor customer service that its unbelievable. I will NEVER order from the Walmart site again!! April 19th I placed an order. My credit card was charged. States I would receive order May 1-6th. No order arrived And NO ONE will respond to my questions. Please be aware of this company
2770,45200,Wendie Renee Halbert,20/05/2020,Walmart,If I could give no stars I would but it forced me to give at least one star to write a review. I will be deleting my Walmart app and never purchasing through them again. I have ordered and shopped Walmart for years. Recently I ordered tiles for a floor and they took my money and never received my tiles. I have also ordered two area rugs and they have not made it to my door either. They are ridiculous when you call customer service they are saying they have nothing to do with it and they canâ€™t help me. Do not order through Walmart. They are awful.

The packs have been $2.86 for years. Within a week of my last arrival, the price jumped to $3.98. If that is not price gouging I don't know what is!"

I have always enjoyed what I ordered from company but no I don't. This is good Walmart. Com
2774,45204,Karen Starnes,20/05/2020,Walmart,"Walmart really went above and beyond today. I used the self checkout to buy a full length mirror and I set it aside and sadly I bumped it and it fell over and shattered in the middle of the floor. I was incredibly sad bc it was the last mirror and thought I would have to pay for it, but the woman in self check out said it was okay and refunded it and even asked me if I was okay. It was a sad & embarrassing trip to Walmart but I really appreciated the customer service bc it could have been a lot worse."

2776,40635,Frank Lopez,20/05/2022,Walmart,"My complaint is about one of the Walmart's in Pearland, TX. It seems that on some items when prices are increased apparently overnight. The registers are changed to reflect the new price, but the tags on the shelves when they can be found are not changed. I have been surprised almost every time at the register. The price can be anywhere from 10 cents to a couple of dollars (I never but major stuff at Walmart). It may not be much of a price difference, but add that with the daily amount of people getting overcharged than it becomes quite a bit. I now only but at Walmart if I have no other option. Too bad they ran all the other businesses off by undercutting them. Bottom line is they are a monopoly and in need of competition."
2777,40636,KellyP Parde,20/05/2022,Walmart,The item I purchased was not as expected. The vacuum I purchased looked like it had been previously used. I now have to ship it back and wait longer for the new one to be shipped out. NOT happy with my experience. I should have just gone into the store.
2778,40637,Popi,20/05/2022,Walmart,"I have shopped the Carthage Walmart for over 30 yrs! Now I shop at Aldi's and King Cash for a decent purchase. One they do not move their products around the entire store so i can actually get an idea where my items are located. They do not price gouge products overnight like Walmart continues to practice. While they move it to a new more for a higher price in the name of marketing. This is our thanks for supporting our local ""GREEDY"" hope you go broke carthage Walmart!"
2779,40638,Elizabeth,20/05/2022,Walmart,"I do grocery pick-up with Wal-Mart. It's very easy, the app is super simple to use. I have only had one time, out of many that my fresh groceries weren't very fresh. I went to customer service and they refunded me for every item that wasn't good. Other than that, every other time my orders have been perfect. The staff is always very polite and hard working."
2780,40639,Matt,20/05/2022,Walmart,"I do not recommend walmart. They took my payment, delivered my item in another city and now I have to dispute with my bank. According to the rep. I could get compensation if I re-ordered, but it would take 2 weeks to deliver. What a Shame."
2781,40675,Joody,20/05/2022,Walmart,"WARNING: I made an online purchase from Walmart from one of their third party sellers. I was unhappy with the product. I followed the instructions on the Walmart website and promptly took the unused product to a Walmart store for a return. Unfortunately Walmart did not follow their own return policy and did not return the product. Instead, they shifted the responsibility to the third party seller. The 100% satisfaction gaurantee is a joke. I will never purchase anything from Walmart again and I will tell as many people as possible about the terrible customer service experience that I received today. Update: Itâ€™s 2 weeks later with many phone calls and broken promises from Walmart. They took my product back but have not returned my money. Many reviewers have called Walmart crooks. I can see why."
2782,47185,George Long,21/05/2017,Walmart,We went to the Walmart at High Ridge to have my girl friend's glasses repaired and Jennifer Garrett was so helpful and pleasant that she saved our day so much that I must tell you what a great employee you have there. She did not charge us anything for installing the nose pads that we purchased there and I wanted to give her a tip for her fine service and she informed us of the no tipping policy that Walmart has. Boo Walmart!!! These folks are so nice and they work hard. I hope you will take this review in consideration when it becomes evaluation and raise time for this lovely lady with an excellent personality. She is an employee to be proud of. Sincerely George Richard Long ( a long time and regular Walmart shopper)
2783,47186,Mark Cremer,21/05/2017,Walmart,"WalMart is a ripoff that seems to know no bounds. I purchased a $25 blu ray thinking I was getting a movie but it turned out to be a freaking cartoon. As soon as I realized that, I returned it to the store, less than 20 minutes after purchase and was told that because of copyright it could not be returned. I will NEVER shop at Walmart again."
2784,46766,Terry Nesmith,21/05/2019,Walmart,Eye glass lenses are bad quality. I've more trouble with glasses from Walmart than any other company. They don't honor their warranty. I would not trust them.

2789,40631,Jane,21/05/2022,Walmart,"Will never come back. Rudest service ever. In fact, no service. No one knows anything. App doesnâ€™t even work. Team lead called to customer service told me she didnâ€™t know answers to basic questions. Went back out to Order Pick Up and waited 15 mins after checking in for 2 small items. Called again as there was only one other car being helped and asked how long it would take for my order to be out. The man said â€œit doesnâ€™t exactly work that way.â€ What???? â€œOh, itâ€™s random,â€ he said. What???? Meanwhile, even though I was on time for pick up, yes, you must abide by WalMartâ€™s rules but there is no advocacy for customers, my card will be charged the full amount and then, hopefully, the amount will be refunded in 3 business days. You are kidding, right? Really? What an atrocity. On my way to Target. Cleaner store, better technology, friendly, helpful associates."

Walmart canceled my order without my knowledge , after talking with 3 people, I found out it was out of stock. Not 1 email or text saying it was out of stock. It only said it was unavailable or there was problem and it never said it was canceled. I found that out after I talked to 3 people. That was not $5.00 you people was playing around with, it was $219.00 , to me that is a lot of money!! I will never order form walmart.com again. It was my 1st time ordering online and my last time!! I don't like people messing with our hard earn money!! Your website said it was in stock, but the store says it was not. y'all need ti fix this issue, I found out I am not the only person something like this has happened!! Believe me, if Pell City had another store that carried the items Walmart carriers, I would never step back into the store again! BTW I am still waiting on my $219.00 to be refunded, but it only took seconds for walmart to get it out of my account!!!!!!"

At store 0706, in Zephyrhills, Florida, they needed a LDO, so I went in to speak with an assitant store manager, who knows NOTHIUNG about optics or the optical industry. I stated I wanted just to help them on a part-time basis until they found another LDO, as they are extremely short staffed. This so-called interview took place on April 29, 2019...

I have open a claim against Walmart with the Secretary of State and now someone called me but she seems to know nothing that would help my situation. I advise you all to please open a claim with your Secretary of State because they might be prevented to do business until they fix their online problem but we need to open cases and keep opening it until we get heard.

Of all the stores nearby I could find, it said the green and silver was available, when I called, they said it was there, when I went, it was not, all they had was a red one. They told me that the model is the same but they have no choice of colors that they get! [I'm sorry, but WHAT?!!!] Go to a furniture store and order a brown sofa, and when they deliver a blue one, tell me how you feel then! I'm very angry, Won't be ordering from them online any time soon, I won't know what I'll get based on my order!"

I checked tracking number with UPS and Wal-Mart never shipped the trampoline and its out of stock. Now I have a net, no trampoline. After 5 calls and being on hold for 6 hours, I was told 3 times that a shipping company would be in contact with me to pick up the item for return. 6th call I was told to return the item to my local Walmart (in the middle of the pandemic shut down). 3 weeks later I get recharged for the item because they have no record of the return. Yet another call, I get told they will call me tomorrow morning at 6AM!! So they can transfer me to another department!! Guess we will see if I will be awake tomorrow at 6AM, if not I will be disputing the charge. Don't waste your time, spend the extra few bucks and get your stuff elsewhere unless you enjoy spending hours on the phone with people who barely speak English."
2812,45185,Ericka Robinson,23/05/2020,Walmart,"Walmart south 710 East Ben White the customer service is horrible. I went to pay a Sams club bill there like usual in the customer service department. The young lady that was helping me really wasn't, familiar with the payment process. There was a manager near by and the young lady asked the manager Christina about the process and the manager stated to me ""We don't take Sams payments here"". I informed Christina that I have always paid my bill there. Christina threw her hands up very disrespectful and rudely and said go to the pay center. I then asked for a manager she got rude and said I am the only manager here, but didn't tell the truth. I call a cousin that works at that Walmart and asked if there is a supervisor on site and yes there was another supervisor on site. I then asked for the phone number to the corporate office. she basically refused to give out that number. I will not be going back to that Walmart any more. Walmarts Manager Christina needs to work on her people skills. Christina needs take more trainings on customer service."
2813,36203,AA J.,23/05/2022,Amazon Go,"Today I popped into the new Amazon Go on 132nd in Mill Creek. I purchased a turkey & Swiss croissant sandwich as well as Melt in your Mouth cookie from Alki Bakery. The sandwich was decent. The cookie tasted old. I looked for an expiration date, did not find o e. But what I did find was the date the cookie was packaged...01/29/22! What?!! I just purchased a cookie, from a brand new store, that was packed 4mos ago?!! Pretty disappointing Amazon. Things were over priced in comparison to a grocery store or even a small convenience store. I thought it might be worth it for convenience once in awhile but not when you have to sacrifice quality. Amazon failed again."
2814,43149,Cheated,23/05/2021,Walmart,"Recent online purchases were not received. On one order, delivery was delivered by Grub Hub, which I DID NOT WANT. I wanted the bag of party candy to come VIA MAIL. I never did get that first bag and the snapshot the delivery person took was OF THE INSIDE OF HIS/HER CAR! They delivered another order where the grocery bag had been opened and the contents fell out as I picked it up from my stoop. That was a week ago. I am presently waiting for an order that Walmart said would be here on the 21st of May. Unfortunately for me, this order was a third Party seller so according to the Customer Service person at Walmart, I now have to give 48 hrs to the vendor to contact me and if I donâ€™t hear from them, I have to recontact Walmart Customer Service. Meanwhile, Iâ€™ve already paid for the purchase and I have nothing. This is the 3rd time Iâ€™ve had issues with Walmart dot com in LESS THAN TWO WEEKS! WALMART IS BROKEN! I pray I donâ€™t have to go to them for anything ever again!"
2815,43150,George Trump,23/05/2021,Walmart,Bought stuff on line told I could pick up in a few hours. Checked on order told I would get refund on order 6 hours after order was placed cause they said they donâ€™t have any at store went over to store so I could get my money back and they have a full skid what I ordered. Done with this place
2816,43151,Ted Trebilcock,23/05/2021,Walmart,"The store manager and the inventory purchasing manager are selling â€œGood Year 26â€ heavy duty 1.9 to 2.3 bicycle tubesâ€ for bikes that are of such a low quality they donâ€™t work. I bought 3 boxes so I had 6 tubes. After installing and carefully not stressing or jarring the valve, three of them within 60 seconds blew out - meaning the valve itself let go. I then checked on the internet and folks have been complaint about these bike tires. At some point this becomes the store manager doing this on purpose, stealing from their customers by selling defective garbage, made in China, and not caring. They do not like their customers. They are harming us citizens because they are mean and donâ€™t care. Buy bike tires some where else."

2818,40622,Terry D Junior,23/05/2022,Walmart,"I will be as helpful and not negative as possible. I purchased a window AC unit on 4-23-22 and received a large mattress topper instead. Set up for return through walmart.com for two days later. Didn't realize they sent me a return tag so it was picked up from FedEx on 4-26-22 without a call tag. After calling walmart.com 6 times in two weeks the item can't be tracked. I went to local FedEx hub today and was able to get complete tracking info on package as it was delivered to my house then picked up and shipped back to original Walmart warehouse where it originated. Now I can't seem to get anyone from Walmart.com to send proof of delivery to original shipping location to get my $390 refund. Keep getting a run around. It is currently 5-23-22. Was told at one point by Walmart I would have to go talk to my bank to get money back. Who does this?! Pray for me that I get my money back. I will not be using walmart.com for ANYTHING ELSE ever again. Update, was about to ask for supervisor and after an hour and 20 minutes was able to speak to an American citizen in billing. He was able to refund my money. Very happy with Logan in the walmart.com billing department. That was like pulling teeth!!"

2820,40624,Arlene,23/05/2022,Walmart,I just went on line to Walmart to look at how much Ezekiel Muffins were at Walmart. $86 for Ezekiel Muffins? Who charges that? Who should be allowed to charge that? Disgusting and Deplorable!!!!! Would never buy or patronize Walmart Grocery Shopping!!!!
2821,40625,Christy,23/05/2022,Walmart,I only shop here because there is no other place to shop in my area. The products are cheap and do not last. You can buy something and it may work one time and never again. Nothing is guaranteed and it is a hassle trying to return something. I am just sick over the fact that the quality of the merchandise is so bad and it is made with cheap materials. Nothing in this store is worth any amount of money. It is a rare find if you purchase something from this store and it works or lasts. I don't know where they are getting their stock from but it has dropped way low. People should sell the stock they have and invest in another store like Target who has so much better products. People just dont realize what a rip off this company is. They are really taking advantage of consumers with the cheap products they are selling. If I had a choice I would not ever shop here for anything.

I have order 6 pillows, after two weeks while my order was finally ready to be picked up, all I got was just 1 pillow... And the store staff said this was all they had! The other 5 pillows are missing and they knew nothing and could do nothing... Physical store seemed did not communicate and deal with online order at any level, so they could do nothing for me. I called customer service and all they said its wait... What?! Wait? How long? What was next step? They could not answer rather than be patient and wait... For this reason, I shop again on Amazon and got my things the other day... I will not give up until I found out what happen to my order and consumers like me..."

2828,43143,Walter Eaton,24/05/2021,Walmart,"Walmart ""Customer Service"" I thought I'd save time shopping at Walmart today due to the varied goods I needed to purchase. Big mistake! On a Monday the place was busy! I completed my shopping and proceeded to check-out. Two registers were servicing many customers about ten deep. I was forced to ""scan and go"". A novel concept in which I, the paying customer gets to perform the duties previously done by paid employees. As I've always managed to avoid this travesty (I'm of the mind-set trained employees should be designated to this task). Following my griping a very pleasant employee ""Amanda"" volunteered to help. ""I don't mind"" she cheerfully exclaimed. Several of the items required her to look up the SKU'S and type into the scanner. They didn't match. We then had to discard the bags and run each item back through another register. This entire process took about 20 minutes. The poor employee kept apologizing and I felt bad for her, as well as me. Clearly Walmart is attempting to reduce their workplace over head by eliminating the register employee and getting the paying customer to volunteer our time to increase the Walton's wealth. The heirs of Sam are worth 155 billion according to a 2019 survey. Indeed two of them are among the thirty wealthiest people in America. When is enough wealth, enough? For me, I'm avoiding any of these entities that practice this form of retail abuse. Bye Walmart!"
2829,43144,Lauren Lam,24/05/2021,Walmart,"Went to purchase an outdoor rug that is listed on website and also offered Sam day pick up. Figured Iâ€™d just grab it while at the store since I have other small items to get. Price listed online was $49.97. Attempted to purchase in store, the exact rug, it rang up at $89.00. I told the sales associate the website says $49.97. Sales associate told me they do no price match. I advised her that this is YOURS(Walmart) website! She said the prices are different on website and that they donâ€™t price match their own site. Gtfoh....craziest thing Iâ€™ve heard. If I were to order same day pick up for THAT exact item, I would be getting it for the $49.97. At this point Iâ€™d rather pay more for better service."

Was told walmart.com was down and they could not refund to my credit card and was given a store gift card. Also employee was NOT wearing her mask had it around her neck. I asked her to put her mask on. She told me to"" Mind my own Business "" I took a photo of this person. Called Walmart corporate and they gave me a 10.00 promo for next online purchase... SMH.

This is a new way of scamming sayid g your item arrived and you canâ€™t fight it. Because they will say an item was delivered. Be careful, now you need to record and have proof. It will be your word agains the seller they use. I will take them to the better business bureau."
2833,43148,Tammy,24/05/2021,Walmart,"I had been using Wal Martâ€™s pick up service during the height of COVID-19 and was pleased at least for the few times. Then my orders werenâ€™t ready on time, despite the fact that they were placed several hours in advance. One time my order was ready 3 hours after specified pick up time and the pick up service was already closed for the day. One order was for 6 items placed 12 hours in advance and it wasnâ€™t ready, the store had been to busy that day. Iâ€™ve since stopped using this service. I quite often use the Walmart.com delivery service and am pleased with this service. Today I thought I would take advantage of their free 15 day trial of free delivery. I placed a big grocery order and chose the option for a text to be sent once the groceries were delivered between my chosen time of 12-1pm. Itâ€™s 1pm and still no text, I then check my email and at 12.30pm I received an email that my groceries had been delivered! I went outside and there they were sprawled all over the front walk, falling out of plastic bags in the hot sun, it was in the high 80â€™s!! I had cold and frozen food sitting in the hot sun!! I took my order in and put it away and started going over my digital receipt and realized I was missing about a quarter of my order!! I called the customer service number, was transferred to the wrong department and was put on hold again. When the woman answered, I explained what happened, told her the items I was missing, and she said thank you after every item I mentioned, and said she would refund my card. I told her I wanted the food, thatâ€™s why I placed order and took advantage of a service they offered. She placed me on hold to call the store only to come back on the line to say that she called the store twice and once was placed in hold, and the other time no one answered. I will be cancelling my free trial and NOT recommending Wal Mart to family or friends ever!! And I was also told that the delivery service doesnâ€™t send a text upon delivery, even though I checked the box to receive a text upon delivery! Oh, and I went to Aldiâ€™s to get my missing items and was able to pick up a few more items for the same price of my undelivered Wal Mart items. I will BE recommending Aldiâ€™s to family and friends which can have my pick-up order ready in less then 30 minutes from start to finish. BYE BYE WALMART!!!!"
2834,43152,Angel,24/05/2021,Walmart,"This is a thrift store. I bought a TCL TV 50"" and it stopped working after two months. I approached to this location (niles, IL) and asked them why my TV turned black and what my choice was to return it...they said: ""you may buy a new one and to throw the other one away""...it was amazing to hear how they implicitly recognized that what they sold was garbage. I asked to speak to the manager and he told me the same thing (May 22,/2021 @ 3pm) They do not care about what you have to say or to keep you as a costumer. They recognized that whatever you buy, you eventually will end up throwing them away after few either weeks or months...! that is a thrift store. they are not going to take any responsibility for any garbage they sell; however, you are most welcome to continue buying in their thrift store. You never should buy any electrical appliance, cells, or expensive products. they do not guarantee any products more than one month because they know that those things are wasting money...it is a joke when they say that they will cover the first months...that is their game because they know that whatever they have do not last too much time. They do not bother to ask their providers about quality of their products since they are not made in US. Stay away from those thrift stores. if you are a young professional, it is better to spend a little bit more but you will get good asleep. ABT, Best Buy or amazon are a good alternative for electronic equipments, appliance or furniture."
2835,40616,Monique S,24/05/2022,Walmart,"I have been purchasing on Walmart.com for 8 years now. Two times in the past few months Walmart has allowed someone to hack into my account & purchase hundreds of dollars worth of items. The first time I had to obtain a new business cc, which is such a hassle with all of my automatic debits coming out each month. Again yesterday an order was canceled because it was suspected to be fraudulent. I called the Walmart.com number only to be bounced back & forth to the corporate office. No manager was available to speak to me to help me to understand how this could happen not once but twice in a few months. I am suspecting itâ€™s their employees now,but Iâ€™m not sure. I told them I wanted to close my account & with no hesitation,no trying to keep me as a valued customer they did exactly that deactivated my account. Buyer BEWARE!!! This website is not secure!!!!!"

After 2 weeks of tracking order, got an email regarding my items been delivered while they did send it to another region. After following up my complaints, they said they are sorry and they would refund my money which will take 2 billing cycles like 2 months. I paid right away to buy the item. Why do they delay to refund my money ???? That was my first time buying from Walmart online and will be my last time for good. I am very disappointed and will not recommend Walmart online shopping never ever. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼"

2838,40619,Debra,24/05/2022,Walmart,"Walmart in Woodbury, MN: Itâ€™s not entirely true when they say Free Shipping, if youâ€™re above the min. purchase. Itâ€™s very sketchy, actually! Even though Iâ€™ve been above the min., Iâ€™ve been hit with shipping fees and sometimes â€œBelow min feeâ€ charges.  Iâ€™ve also been hit with duplicate charges (doubling items), then when you return the items, I only receive a refund for one item. Also, no refunds for the added fees. Totally CHEATING people!! Youâ€™re tipping the scales!  This is to warn people to pay attention to your charges, added fees, and quantity of items. Also, scrutinize your refunds!!  Iâ€™ve also had some problems ordering a set (I.e. 6 headband in a set) of items, only to get and be charged with one item out of the set. Also, totally cheating people!! I donâ€™t know who these vendors are (Chinese vendor names), but some are obviously NOT to be trusted!  Another serious issue is Walmartâ€™s Customer Service Dept. NOT answering their phones. It would seem whoever answers the phones initially catches wind that you have an issue, your call and number are flagged so that no one picks up. My guess is that they canâ€™t handle ALL of the complaints so they donâ€™t bother anymoreâ€¦.. Very POOR management!! They just lost another customer."

They have the lowest prices a lot of times, they get one star for that, but most of the time its only by a few cents and the way they do it isn't worth it. They don't treat their employees that well. They need to be compensated more and they can't keep such a bad record with avoiding the promotion of females to higher positions. I feel bad for them. I would rather shop somewhere else even if I have to pay a little more."

I have recently learned how to use the check out and enjoy it much more and its faster. there is always someone in the self check out to help.  Prices are by far the best. Assortment depending on which store is above average. Returns are easy with a generous time frame with and without a receipt.  opening hours have cut back here in NV.

2842,36276,Steph G.,25/05/2018,Amazon Go,"Wanted to start off stating that just because I'm an Amazonian does not mean this review will be biased. The Amazon Go store is such a cool addition to Seattle. I'm excited to see them pop up elsewhere so others can enjoy the fun.  While the store is small, it's always stocked with amazing grab and go items. The process is simple!!download the Amazon Go app on your smartphone and you'll log into your existing Amazon account. This will give you instant access to your preferred payment methods stored on your account. You scan to get into the store and that is where the magic behind the curtains happens.  Without getting into much detail (because we can't), the moment you've scanned into the store, anything you grab and place into your really cool AND FREE reusable Amazon Go bag is tracked. This scares some people as technology can be quite intimidating at this level! But trust me, it's accurate!  I had not gone in a while but decided to stop by before a meeting in one of the neighboring offices. The process was flawless and I began my scan of items I was going to buy. As usual, I really just wanted a La Croix and ended up buying a ton of goodies because everything is reasonably priced! Not to mention they sell Blazing Bagels! This was awesome for me to see and despite the store being a roughly 20 minute walk from my office, I'm probably going to come a lot more often!  They have a ton of bottled drinks, breakfast and lunch sandwiches, prepared dinner meals, veggies, now serving bottled alcohol! If I lived in seattle I would probably shop here all the time! If you haven't checked it out, download the app and experience it!"
2843,43137,Matt Wells,25/05/2021,Walmart,"Absolutely the worst customer experience at the Florence, KY Walmart location. We purchased a bike for a birthday (1 week before b-day), they said they could assemble it in a day or two. My wife called and the response was that the bike assembly person had not shown up. My wife called 5 days later and they said the bike was in terrible shape, but offered no alternative. Said they could only refund the bike. We requested if there was a bike at another Walmart location, if we could get that one. David, the manager we were talking to at this point, stated there is no way for them to get the bike from the other location to Florence, KY location (less than 20 miles away). One of the world's largest logistics companies can't get a bike from a location 20 miles away. I offered to get the bike, but they would not give a price break for the time we would have to go get the bike. Again, absolutely ridiculous one store cannot work with another store to ensure a happy customer experience. Manager David kept saying his hands are tied, he's not able to do either of those things. He stated the Store Manager was not at the Florence location, so he was one of the highest ranking managers at the Florence location at that point. It's unbelievable a manager of that level cannot ensure a good outcome for a customer. My wife has spent at least 4 hours trying to get this issue resolved, of which at least an hour was on hold. Just a refund does not effectively remedy this situation. It's unheard of that a manager does not have the authority to do any more to help the customer through this Walmart failure."

2848,43142,mark c,25/05/2021,Walmart,"Criminal Conduct!  I placed an on-line order with Walmart for two cans of Minwax for a total price of $43.12.  The Fed X tracking indicated the item arrived on May 18th, 20201 at 12:12 p.m. I checked my porch and it was not there. I checked my Ring camera and it showed no deliveries for that day. I called Fed X and they said the package was delivered to an address on Onstott Frontage Road in Yuba City and a person by the name of AEVANS signed for it. I live on a completely different street and I know no-one by the name of AEVANS. Obviously, the package was delivered to the wrong address.  Fed X said it was Walmartâ€™s fault because they put the wrong tracking number and wrong address on my order. I was told to contact Walmart for an easy resolution. The Fed X representative said put the information we discussed into Fed X and Walmartâ€™s notes regarding this order so Walmart could review the notes and easily resolve the matter.  On May 21, 2021, I â€œchattedâ€ on-line with a Walmart representative and she said that since the item was signed for, she would not help me. I told her to check Fed X notes about the delivery address and the person who signed. Both have no relationship to me. She told me there was nothing she would or could do and to dispute the charge with my credit card company. That takes five weeks or more and offers no guarantee!  Walmart, being one of the richest companies in the world does not seem to care about customer support. I have never had any trouble whatsoever with Amazon orders when a problem arises. It is handled immediately with one phone call.  Apparently, itâ€™s Walmartâ€™s policy to cheat their customers, and what can a consumer do when the company that took your money refuses to make good, reimburse or credit you. Itâ€™s out and out theft and action should be taken against such companies."

The woman at the customer service department told me they were closed. Walmart closes at 11pm. So why would they refuse to help me? I asked for a manager who later arrived at 9pm and she refused to do the exchange as well. The manager's name is ELIZABETH, she said, she was not going to do the exchange and as I was walking away she very loudly yelled, ""this is the worst store to work at and shop at."" Says a lot if a store manager yells that at the customers. I will be returning my item today & I will be taking my business elsewhere & I will let others know that this is the worst Walmart store because their own employees told me so."
2850,40613,John,25/05/2022,Walmart,"For the first time I am writing a review about walmart .Sam Walton was a simple guy who built an empire by providing goods and services .Over the years while Walmart profits has increased simultaneously Services and Product quality has Declined. I make no apologies for saying that there are stores within the Walmart chain that has fallen so bad its literally a ""cesspool"". This may come down to localize management but either way someone through the rank and file is definitely not doing there job.It is sad to know the hiring process looking at resumes takes 2 months minimum and then some epically when stores are lacking workers such as cleaners,packers , cashiers etc ...I.know this first hand ! Word of advice to Walmart upper upper management i know its difficult to see the ground when you reach the cloud. At least share in the vision of the founder , the legacy of Sam Walton ..not only by name but also by great customer service , great products , and the discipline and focus to Maintain employees and pay attention to whats happening on the ground ."

2854,47183,Jennifer,26/05/2017,Walmart,Had terrible experience using their buy online and pick up at location
2855,46758,Duane Tucker,26/05/2019,Walmart,Great improvement that Walmart has made here. Your team is finally getting their stuff together.
2856,45176,Juan A Wilkinson,26/05/2020,Walmart,"Order says delivered and is NOT at my door or mail box. When trying to contact customer service I receive NOTHING no actual people and a message that suggests I wait 48hrs. Really? Then why did you send me an email saying ""arrived""? It's not at all hard to have the object arrive and THEN send the email. Worthless."
2857,45177,Bothaina Hassan,26/05/2020,Walmart,GREAT REALLY

2859,45179,Steph,26/05/2020,Walmart,when i worked here a few of the managers ganged up on me and tried to get me fired. all i did was work hard even spoke with the store manager and told him i would love to move up one day and wanted to grow with the company and make it a career for myself. they were working me so hard getting mad at me for helping customers find things or if i didn't do unrealistic timed tasks. i ended up and antidepressants because they were treating me so badly. i was being harassed off the clock as well when shopping with my family on my days off being told i shouldnt wear certain clothes ( i was in jeans and a tank top). i remember one of the managers that hated me pulling me in to the office after yelling at me in front of a customer when i was trying to explain another manager had told me not to let other managers override something on our registers. i was simply following instructions. i was so upset and nearly had a mental break in front of the customer then she pulled me in the office to write me up for being defiant and tried to get me to sign a paper stating that i understood i was in trouble. the store manager wasn't any help either as it got worse after i explained what was happening. i went on medical leave when i found out my mother had breast cancer and never went back. it took me two years to not have complete anxiety attacks just walking through the doors. i rarely shop there now and will never work for walmart again.
2860,45180,Saman Karimi,26/05/2020,Walmart,"They don't accept returns even when it is perfectly reasonable to do so. Once they even refused to take back an item I bought, in sealed original packaging. A lot of their products is expensive low quality things which are made in China, coupled with their poo poor customer service."
2861,36251,Shaylor S.,26/05/2019,Amazon Go,"This is definitely the future of shopping. Basically no direct interaction. All surrogate and independent processes. It is very enabling for the customer making things quick and efficient. Really fun to experience! If Amazon can make this profitable, this will be an exciting future.  Open the app when you walk in and scan your phone. Put your phone in your pocket and go grab whatever you need. Lots of good snack and drink options with very low prices. Prices that you would see in any grocery store. When ever you're ready, just walk out and go on your way. So simple and enjoyable. Sensors galore all over the ceiling. Try to steal something, it just won't work.  Two concerns I had: If I put stuff back in a completely wrong spot or on the other side of the store, will that mess things up? Will it charge me? Does it have to go exactly back to the spot I grabbed it from? I scanned into the store on the app and I realized my phone was at 1%. If my phone died before I walked out, would that have caused any issues?"
2862,43129,Martin Timmons,26/05/2021,Walmart,We purchased the Baby Shark Vaccum for our daughter for her birthday. She absolutely loves it!!!!
2863,43130,larry smith,26/05/2021,Walmart,We purchased a tent for our daughter online Tuesday before Mamorial day weekend. They had 5 in stock at the Mount Pleasant Michigan store. We waited the rest of that afternoon and late into the next morning for them to get our order prepared for pick up. Around noon the following day they sent a email back to us saying they had to cancel our order do to high demand. So because they did not prepare our order in a timely manner the 5 they had in stock sold out by the next day. Ours should have been ready for pickup the previous evening. Now by the time I get out of work today I have one afternoon to find one before we go camping for the holiday weekend. Most the ones we looked at the afternoon before are sold out now. I will never order anything from Walmart again.
2864,43131,Livia Sanchez,26/05/2021,Walmart,"If I had the option of no stars that would be what I would choose, but I didnâ€™t. I bought a money order for 1,330.00 dollars as I do every month to pay my rent I accidentally tore one in the wrong place, and Walmart store would not void it and issue me a new one. I am very disappointed because I shop there everyday and I will never again. I am just suppose to lose 330.00 dollars and I canâ€™t afford to do that. Walmart on 288 st. And 137 ave in Naranja, Florida. Very disappointed."
2865,43132,Sherry L.,26/05/2021,Walmart,Do not order a swimming pool from Walmart.com. They order from a company that uses SAIA TRUCKING and they lose a 500# package when it gets to Columbus. It has a tracking# that serves no purpose. They can't find it. Sounds like someone got a free 24x52 swimming pool.
2866,43133,Kevin Allen,26/05/2021,Walmart,"Bought a set of tires(5) from walmart.com. Had tires mounted at tire dealer, but they couldn't get one to balance. Had another tire dealer check tire and they told me it was made out of round. Meaning it will not balance out. Tried contacting tire manufacturer... Crickets... Contacted WalMart customer service.. what a freaking joke!!!!. It has been several months and the issue still isn't resolved. My advice.... stay away from walmart.com when you want tires!!! The company Suretrac sucks butt crack and so does WalMart customer service!!!!"
2867,43134,Kendell Pierre,26/05/2021,Walmart,walmart is a rip off like all the other stores. Don't buy from them. They're letting other retailers buy Playstation 5 at regular prices and coming back on their website to sell at double the price paid for. If you don't believe me check for yourself. PS 5 cost $399.99-$499.99 but you can go on Walmart now and pay $1000 plus by other distributors.
2868,43135,Tori Ambrosia,26/05/2021,Walmart,"I went to Walmart at about 9:30pm And we had went to the tech area because I wanted to buy a laptop (there were still 2 people back there so we assumed they were still open, because at the time they didnâ€™t have the drawer ready to take up front). Well, they were out of the one I wanted to buy so we kept looking to find one not out of stock. We finally found one and as soon as we were about to go up and ask them for it, they were taking the drawer up front. Basically closing up that area. I have a job and Iâ€™m pretty sure they werenâ€™t supposed to do that because itâ€™s rude, like refusing a customers service, but ok. ðŸ™ƒ"

2870,40608,Sheila Michubu,26/05/2022,Walmart,"This is a horrible horrible app. Doesn't matter when you order, whether two days in advance or 1 hour.... very nonsensical people. And they won't even refund, or even send you the right order. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. HORRIBLE PEOPLE. HORRIBLE DELIVERY. NO MATTER HOW LONG YOUVE BEEN SHOPPING ONLINE. HORRIBLE."
2871,40609,Chaudhary,26/05/2022,Walmart,"I ordered more than 10 times online for delivery. I normally select delivery time for next day mornings because the shipment address is a business and closes at 5:00 pm. Every time I got confirmation email for next day delivery. But at 6:00 or 7pm suddenly a message pop up,â€ Congratulations your delivery is coming early. There is no option to stop the delivery. The phone call to help line took too long and the dasher starts blowing my phone Û” some time I canceled order and some time I sent some one to receive delivery. I called couple more times but the attendant doesnâ€™t have control on this kind of matter. I canceled my Walmart + account and started ordering from Costco. Much better service. Walmart online is extremely horrible"
2872,40610,Mrs J,26/05/2022,Walmart,"The Walmart Store in Portage, Indiana needs supervisors that workers can respect, but can be RESPECTFUL. May 23, 2022 around 930am myself and husband went to the Walmart store in Portage, IN to surprise my mother in law and husband (Mother) with a late Mother's Day gift. A 65"" color television, we use to enjoy this store, but some workers and higher management got things messed up with there Nasty A** dispositions. We were in Electronics no one was around and those coming out by back maybe stocking or pulling a jack looked at us like, we are beneath them or racists. This female employee didn't ask. If we needed help nothing just walked by not once but twice. My husband had to walk back to the front ask someone to page for help, then a nice employee came and stated, they pulled majority of the workers to chemical for freight, because of night crew work. We had nothing to with that. I could have been more understanding. If the rude ass supervisor over store Nina wouldn't have stated to the worker on the phone. That she wasn't coming down to speak with us, we heard her from the phone. Who does that?? I don't know her problem but supervisory positioning isn't for her, I see this all the time. People get a little authority and forget whom they're. First of all, Nina you choose that position, and just because you may have a title do not make you better than everyone else, I feel the owners, accountants whom ever is there, should help out in the store, don't throw all responsibility on the other employees this is why you're short handed. BEING DISRESPECTFUL AS F*** it's hard enough the Governor Opt out on all funding with inflation, food, living expenses, Healthcare on the rise but now he wants people to work for little or nothing while the world is still in casois, damn the loyalty that you do have with employees be greatly and Pay them so they can live and take care of theirs. Then Shannon a manager comes and she's apologic,, but lie in our faces and say Nina is on a conference call, how is that, when she was yelling saying She's not coming to Electronics to talk with customers whom spend money in a store, she's overseeing.  God is definitely on his way,because people like Nina are horribly rude and needs a reality check, and Shannon be a Manger stand up do what's right and not such up to people over you, when you knew Nina actions were wrong. People treat others the way you want to be treated. Because one day you will see that same person and God help you, if you may need that person help and they treat you the way you treated them, when they were in that store. Truly sad  I ðŸ™ ðŸ™ we can get ourselves together a d be one nation"
2873,40611,Deep,26/05/2022,Walmart,"I went delta b.c Scott road Walmart today , need to pickup baby formula which is usually under lock . I called assistant they announced two time nobody shows up its been 10mints already then I went at the front ask some help she said someone will come I went back but nobody shows up I wait 5 to 7 mint there then again I went up to the customer service ask that lady for help still nobody came for help , then she is the one went back Nd grab a milk for me which is wrong but still I appreciate her then again I went with her and took the right one but all together I spend 30 mints just for pickup babay formula which is not right . I asked manager, He came only say sorry but nothing else like will provide more staff or something, one mom also want to pickup babay milk but she left because she needs to pickup his son from class. This is very sad when we went and waste our time so request to Walmart authorities see this stuff and make good plan so customers not effected after that I was so upset even I donâ€™t want to do grocery shopping .very frustrating if they reduced the staff-from the floor how they can work either they should call robots ðŸ¤– like they open self service pay machine ."
2874,47313,m moore,27/05/2015,Walmart,"I love the great prices and I like the convenience of one stopping for household items, clothes and groceries. The store can be crowded on weekends, but so is the Costco we go to, so try to shop on weekdays."
2875,47290,Johnny appleseed,27/05/2016,Walmart,"My delivery is now over a week overdue and Walmart has provided NO explanation.

Now my shirt is still in North Carolina. Is been one week and it was supposed to arrive today! They promise 2 day delivery but dont. When you call you are told there is extended wait time of over an hour. Im sorry but I dont believe every day there is that long of a wait. They just dont want to hear the complaints. I will NEVER order online from them again. If you want to get your items on time go with Amazon. I know I will."
2877,45166,Michelle Jackson,27/05/2020,Walmart,"Don't buy any electronics from WALMART they have terrible old stuff and it's not worth it...and they also cancel your orders when they don't want to deliver merchandise. I bought a laptop from them in December and paid over eight hundred dollars for it...to this day it doesn't work well at all, the keyboard sticks and the screen goes black. Also I tried to order a smart television online from Walmart and they waited until the next day to cancel my order claiming that they didn't have good payment information, which is WRONG because they will either decline your creditcard or approve it the same day...so that doesn't make any sense...this place is not worth shopping for electronics...it's only good for cheap clothes and things that are cheap."
2878,45167,shannon scott,27/05/2020,Walmart,I ordered a loft bed at the beginning of April. To be fair FedEx lost the package and I was told to contact the seller. The seller was someone on WalMart's website and I could not get contact info for. One month four days later the bed shows up after I already had to purchase another. I will never shop WalMart.com again. I have had issues with Amazon but was immediately able to speak with someone and get resolution. Sadly this was not so with WalMart.
2879,45168,Fauntasia Le Ganiel,27/05/2020,Walmart,"I ordered a bunk bed from the walmart website to be delivered to my home in Pennsylvania and it was delivered to New York instead. When I called customer service they were of no help they told me I had to go to my local walmart to complain, which was false information. This was the third time I had ordered from them and the third time I did not receive my merchandise. . This is by far the worst company to order from. I was promised a full refund in a week. When I went in to look for bunk beds in the west york pa store the man I asked for help refused to call someone to furniture so I went to the counter to ask and again was not given the help requested. This is an ongoing issue with walmart. I am very upset with the services of this store."
2880,45169,judy mck,27/05/2020,Walmart,they have very rude people working for them this will be the last time i go there
2881,45170,Emre Dinc,27/05/2020,Walmart,You can not find what you like price realy expensive
2882,45171,MsNickie,27/05/2020,Walmart,"So Walmart.com decided to deactivate my account and told me I violated their policies concerning returns. They have some nerve. I had previously told them that I would not be placing anymore online orders anyway because I am tired of getting scammed and being sent counterfeit products or products that are damaged or spoiled. I have had NUMEROUS problems with placing orders on Walmart.com. Most times I do not get my order, the order shows up days or weeks late, it's damaged, or I am being sent a fake product. Over the last few weeks since COVID-19, I have had to deal with incorrect orders, money being taken from my account unauthorized, damaged smelly products, and the list goes on and on and on. I have complained several times about scam sellers and Walmart does nothing but blame me and think I am wrong, which couldn't be further from the truth.  One Walmart.com seller even sent me two shoes of different sizes where someone wrote over the size 9 and put the number 7!!!. Unbelievable!!! I wear a size 7 in shoes, so how in the holy hell did they think I could wear a size 9 flat shoe and the other shoe being a size 7?! The f&*k??? Actually, this is a relief. I have had issues with Walmart for years when it came to placing online orders for store pickup or delivery. Walmart.com is a complete scam full of criminals, and when you complain, they do nothing and their nasty attitude miserable employees don't give a royal f$%k! I hope to not even have to shop in their stores, but that is sometimes hard to do because they often have lower prices than other local stores. So I can breathe easier now and just spend my money online elsewhere from more reliable retailers. To be honest, most major retailers are problematic at some point, but I have found that Walmart and Amazon are the absolute worst. And most, if not all, retailers seem to give customers a hard time when it comes to returning items and wanting a refund. I do not want to shop with any store that tries to control me; I'm not anyone's inmate. If I have a legitimate concern, then I have a right to complain or request a refund however many times I want. That's why when I hear about Walmart or Amazon being scammed by customers, I rejoice because they deserve it. No one with active brain cells likes Walmart, people only shop there because it is cheaper when you live on a budget. So f%$k you Walmart, I do NOT need anymore stress and I'm much happier not having to deal with Walmart.com!!! Goodbye!"
2883,45172,James and Ty Whitmire,27/05/2020,Walmart,"Don't purchase clothing from Walmart if you have a growing teenager or have changed sizes recently and need to try them on. They will NOT allow returns on any clothing until they say ""maybe sometime in June"". So keep it/store it until then and maybe they will take it back. But they have a 30 day return policy? They say that the signs are posted. Yeah right, little index cards with small print in obscure places and they have a current sale on clothing now to boot. As far as I'm concerned, the clothing can sit on the racks and rot because I will not purchase from Wally world ever again. Their whole attitude about it made me see red. At least when they sell fireworks, they post HUGE signs that say no returns. Why not about NOT returning clothing? Because it's a straight up rip off. Other stores are allowing returns on clothing and I will stick with them moving forward."
2884,45173,Margot Cabrera,27/05/2020,Walmart,its horrible
2885,45174,Tricia Gartley,27/05/2020,Walmart,This is so Horrible. I purchased a cutting machine online that I no longer needed anymore and I have been trying to return it for about 1 whole month now. I keep contacting Walmart customer service and after staying on the phone over an hour before I even get to reach someone I am told to give it 24hrs and if the 3rd party doesnâ€™t contact them back they will issue my refund as it is a part of Walmart customer service. The people werenâ€™t rude but I am tired of waiting for a refund for this product like just take it damn I just want my money back I had no clue I was ordering from a 3rd party site but after this I will NEVER EVER EVER order from Walmart ever again and or shop in there stores. This is the worst customer service ever. I wouldnâ€™t suggest anyone purchase anything in store or online as I have had issues with returns in the store because I used cash and lost receipt thatâ€™s why I always try to use my card for everything now. Bad store ðŸ™„
2886,45175,Robin Mcinnis,27/05/2020,Walmart,Ordered 2 TV's and one was delivered to the wrong address by FED EX so we never received it.

Never again will I order anything from Walmart or shop there. Terrible experience.

2888,43122,Teresa Norman,27/05/2021,Walmart,"Walmart want to charge membership in your to get free shipping, nothing free about that. Amazon without a membership and prices are comparable. Considering Walmarts prices are not the cheapest anymore I can shop elsewhere we have lots of options."
2889,43123,Amber Taft,27/05/2021,Walmart,Honestly I didn't even want to give this company a one star. I feel like they don't deserve any stars. I have purchased from Walmart.com three times . The first two times was small items and 20.00 or less but never got the items and never got the money back. When you write the merchants about the products they give you run arounds and pretty much refuses to help you. Yesterday I purchased two items for pickup at Walmart near me. Walmart online shows the item was at the store so I purchased it. When my fiancÃ© pulled up to get items he got one out of two items. When I asked about the other item they said that the hold on my card can take 5 to 10 business days for refund. Now I don't think ðŸ¤” it's fair that if I used a ebt card or Walmart gift card my funds would be returned with in 3 hours. But now I used my debt card and I have to wait 5-10 days for my money to be returned for something I never got and never Picked up I feel that if Walmart doesn't have the item they should reach out to customers. Not just email but also call them and see what they want to do. Cause if someone would have called me and said hey I don't have this futon but I have this one I would have paid the difference now I'm out of a bed for my child and gotta wait for the money to be returned smh. I hate Walmart with a passion and I can't wait to get my lawyer involved with this company and help customers get what they want ajd need with out hassle cause I don't feel we should be thrown away and I don't feel they should just take money from us

I wasn't using the numbers under the scratch off part (never used a gift card before to order online or in store), just the ones to the left, and the pin, and no one could tell me to use the other 4!

2894,43128,Mr Unlimited,27/05/2021,Walmart,"Had a grill delivered and the box was open on the bottom when delivers and when I opened the box the grill was damaged ,it has been nothing but a headache since. Have to print a shipping label for fed ex to come back and pick up in which I don't have a printer ,then I can't get one shipped for another couple weeks which is garbage as well. Keep it up WalMart . Your customer service is trash all g with your entire company. Why should I have to wait for a grill and jump through hoops so I can get something I purchased delivered back to my house in a timely matter? How about holding yourselves accountable and stop screwing over your loyal consumers. This is the final straw I am DONE with WalMart and will never spend another dollar of my money with your company."

I requested new hardware but was informed that was not possible and to bring the frame to the store? After much debate they agreed to pick up the frame after I repacked it . 2. I ordered a second bedframe. 3. After receiving my shipped email notification, but no delivery after 5 days, I tracked the package. 4. Stated the bed had been delivered 5 days prior?!? Which it had not. Nor was there any notification for such? 5. I had now paid for 2 frames and had no frame 6. They directed me on my 13th call to fill in some paperwork and reorder a new frame ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸- my refunds were in process 7. Who would be willing to be out for 3 frames- still waiting for my funds after 4 weeks. Run!!!!!!"

2897,40607,Jamie,27/05/2022,Walmart,"I Purchased 4 Goodyear tires and paid extra to have the LIFETIME roadside hazard Warranty with lifetime balance and lifetime tire repair from Walmart Store on County Road 54 and Little Road In New Port Richey Fl 34655. Within 10 months of owning these Goodyear tires, the tires started to Crack in a few places on the tires. I took my car to Walmart tire service and they said it was normal and safe to drive on. As time went on the front driver side tire upper side wall just split open by those cracks in the rubber. So Walmart charged me around $50 to replace that tire even with having the road side hazard under the warranty. Then 11 months later the passenger side front tire came apart like it was a recapped tire when driving at 25MPH in city, and thank god this did not happen on the highway. The Goodyear tires came with a factory 60,000 mile warranty. The first tire blew out side wall at 23K miles the 2nd tire fell apart ripping rubber off like it was a recapped tire at 29K miles. Walmart would not honor road hazard warranty on that 2nd tire. On top of that I had a nail in back tire and went in to get that fixed under lifetime tire repair that I paid extra for. Walmart service said they won't patch the nail leak because the rear Goodyear tires they sold me had cracks in the rubber. These are the same Goodyear tires I showed them within 10 months of being installed with cracks that Walmart Tire Service said was normal cracking. Now Walmart Tire Service said those 2 rear goodyear tires with cracks need to be replaced. Walmart service is telling me they can't honor the lifetime road hazard warranty that I paid extra for because Walmart Tire Service is now blaming the cracking on weather conditions, but tires are designed to drive in different weather conditions. Yet when I took my car into Walmart Tire Service with 9K miles on the tires and within 10 months of bring installed, I was told at that time few cracks were normal. So Walmart Tire Service flip flopped their story to benefit not replacing defected tires they sold me when I first showed them the tires with cracks in the rubber within 10 months of being installed. I never had issues when buying tires from regular tire stores. I feel I was sold defected tires based on all what happened plus these Goodyear tires did not wear well based on Walmart saying tires came with a 60,000 mile wear warranty and front tires blew apart at under 30,000 miles, and it is only a matter of time before the 2 rear Goodyear tires do the same thing."

2901,45136,Giselle,28/05/2020,Walmart,"Never order from Walmart.com. I ordered 500.00 worth of items and they sent me double my order and charged my debit card twice. The same week I ordered from them - my debit card was compromised And 900.00 was taken out. I had to cancel my debit card. I had to return the duplicate items and because my debit card had been cancelled they could not return the money to my card and said because I ordered through Wal-Mart.com I could not receive a cash refund and would have to get my refund in Walmart Gift cards. Additionally, half my order couldnâ€™t be returned and I had to send it back to the 3rd party ... the 3rd party emailed me 1 time and sent me two return labels and I could only print one. They didnâ€™t send a label for the last item. I have been trying to reach Hayneedle, the third party, for days and no response and I have only a couple more weeks before I can no longer return these items. Additionally, I will have to dispute with my bank to try and get a response. This is absolutely unacceptable for a mistake Wal-Mart.com made. I will NEVER use them again and strongly advise against order from them. This has been noting but a nightmare."

The 1st time the said that they could confirm my bank card and they claimed it was their mistake. The second time they claim that my bank had denied my purchase wish my bank never did. The 3rd time i used a credit card and the day that i was supposed to pick up the tv they send me an email that my order was cancel because of high demand. Walmart use to be my favor store and is disappointing that they are doing this. I send them an email and they never replied. Call them as well and all they say is to reorder again. This tv is was supposed to be a gift for my wife.
2903,45138,Dustene Nixon McKenna,28/05/2020,Walmart,My husband order an iPad from Walmart for my birthday. It didn't arrive.

They called FedEx and know that I never received it. I can't dispute it on my credit card because Walmart is keeping it as a pending charge. I guess the next stop is the BBB to try and get help.

2913,45162,D Wyatt,28/05/2020,Walmart,"I think back 10 years or more and Walmart was the place to go, what felt like the best place in the world. I wanted to be there literally everyday! Fast forward to today and I DESPISE going there. It is never an enjoyable experience and honestly for me it has been because of the employees. I live in LA, and I have been to multiple Walmarts and the experience has been the same-no one greets you, they are huddling around talking about personal stories ex.- ""how they didn't get a stimulus check because someone owed taxes,"" complaining about benefits, how much they are paid, hours, ect. I understand if you are unhappy, but if you are choosing to stay then you should be professional and not have discussions like that around customers. I have asked for help and someone just shakes their head no, and the last straw for me was being in Walmart and asking for something from the case-I asked 2 employees that were working in that area ""I don't have the key,"" ok so who has the key? ""Manager up at customer service""-ok, can you go ask for me to get in the case? ""Oh, I would have to walk all the way up there and back because I don't have a radio.!"" WAIT, WHAT! Now come on man, and to beat it all I went to customer service and then the manager tells me to go back and ask the pharmacy because they have the key.  I was appalled and honestly I have been dealing with that kind of environment long enough and that was the last straw. I would rather pay more money and go to a classier store where you are treated with respect, people are friendly, employees aren't miserable and displaying it to customers AFTER I have even heard them in the huddle meetings yelling ""Walmart, Walmart, Walmart.""  Don't be fake Walmart. I know I am only one person, but I am 100% certain that others have experienced the same situations and they are tired of it to."

2918,43108,Ken Mershon Virus Vanquisher,28/05/2021,Walmart,"Order: 4022180-500129 I ordered this on 5/11, it was to arrive on 5/28. I went online today to check if it was still on time and am told to go to Pilot Air Freight and check order 122040186. Pilot Air Freight tells me that is not even a proper tracking number...yet here it is in my email as the tracking number. They look further and find that there is nothing in their system for my address. I then call Walmart (1-800-925-6278), this is where the real fun begins. After navigating their automated system to get to an actual person, the person tells me the shipper picked it up and I am to call them. I explained in detail that I had in fact called the shipper first and they have nothing and the tracking number is not even a number they use! I asked to speak to a manager and one was not available but would call me back in 30mins to 1hour. 3 hours later no call back! I call Walmart back. I gave the girl my order number and she says...""i am sorry our system is slow"" and something else I could not make out. I wait for a few seconds and hear nothing and say hello a couple times and then get a disconnect. I call back for THE THIRD TIME and this time the person tells me the shipper never got the item, Walmart shows it was processed but yet have no shipper info...THEN HOW AND WHY did Walmart send me 122040186?! When was Walmart going to tell me my order was never going to arrive? They then said I could wait till the 15th and I could get another. Ya no. I was told earlier in the call to wait for it a little longer to arrive, yet then later in the call told it was never shipped! So Walmart, that is the new business model? Take people's money and give them nothing...sounds lucrative.  I told my kids about this playset, we talked and talked all about it and made plans. You have DESTROYED our plans and my children's happiness. Sam Walton would turn in his grave if he knew what Walmart has become.  I will NEVER buy from walmart.com again. Amazon from now on. Will be reporting Walmart to the Better Business Bureau."
2919,43109,Linda Miller,28/05/2021,Walmart,"I ordered an online item to be picked up at my local store. I got a mail saying my item had shipped, but the link for tracking never worked. I waited patiently for the mail to pick my item up but that never came. After 10 days I managed to track it through an alternate link, and my item was returned to the seller the day after it was shipped. No idea why. I tried to speak with Walmart Customer Service online. They could not tell me anything. They referred it back to the seller. The seller asked if I wanted a refund or a reship. I chose the refund. I got a mail from WALMART saying it would come in 2 billing cycles. What is a billing cycle? When I tried to ask Walmart Customer Service that simple question on the phone, I got nothing but run around. I paid Walmart for this item, not the manufacturer. I expect my money back within 10 business days, or I will be issuing a chargeback for failure to deliver my item."

2921,43111,Richard Rodrigues,28/05/2021,Walmart,"Shopping on Walmart's online marketplace means you're buying from random sellers, not Walmart. I purchased a swing set weeks ago, though I was charged and notified it was delivered, the product never actually shipped. I found out two days after it was due that it was never shipped. Walmart customer service couldn't figure out what happened or why the tracking info was wrong. To fix it they simply said I would have my $2600 refund sometime in the next two weeks so that I could order from some other place."
2922,43112,LuAnn Foster Leasure,28/05/2021,Walmart,I am 66 years old and have always shopped at walmart. When I went today I finished my shopping and went to check out. There were NO regular checkouts open. Only Self checkouts. I used the self checkouts but was NOT happy. Bags are impossible to open and the whole process is only good if you only purchase a few things. I will now shop at Marc's where they have people working at the checkouts. If I wanted to scan and pack groceries I would get a job doing so.

2925,43115,The Bear Family,28/05/2021,Walmart,"I was considering buying a used portable tabletop ice machine from Kijiji. My partner suggested we get a new one instead, but I insisted they were alot more than the $75 I was to spend on the used one. She found one at Walmart.ca on sale for $119+ hst, with expected delivery of June 11 2021 and convinced me to go that route as a newer unit is more reliable. The reliability may have been possible had we not been dealing with Walmart online. I ordered the unit, paid for it and got my email confirmation. I promptly told the kijiji posting that I had changed my mind and would be buying a new one instead. Now Walmart has canceled the order, citing availability. The kijiji one has sold, and I'm left spending $200 instead of $75. In these times where online shopping has become so prevalent, Walmart has proven that while they want to compete, they aren't actually a reliable online retailer. Who collects payment for an item they don't even have for sale? This will be my last dealing with Walmart online, I will stick with more reputable retailers like, well, any other online retailer out there."

Customer service said they'll make a replacement, but at the end they just give me refund. Then second time, they delivered part of my stuff to somewhere else that I don't even know where to find. I talked to customer service again, whatever they said ended up just a refund. An email told me the rest of my stuff will arrive today, then today I got another email says ""We're processing your refund. "" What's going on?! They just directly give me my refund without saying/doing anything?! That's rediculous and awful! If Walmart had problem delivery stuff to people then don't make any online purchase service!"

2931,43121,Robin Batura,28/05/2021,Walmart,"This store staff, on Collier, near Marco Island, doesn't care about elderly or handicapped people. Not one cash register available other than self checkout. Customer service did not have one customer. However they did have three employees standing there doing nothing. They refused to let me check out which would have been so much easier with my handicap cart and refused to open up a lane. When I got home I could barely get out of the car I was in so much pain. From now on I will shop at Publix because it would be worth paying more money to be treated like a human being. These people on duty at 5:00 p.m. on May 24, 2001 had no compassion or humanity concerns whatsoever. They should be ashamed of themselves."

In addition, their knowledge of the English language is very limited making it almost impossible to understand them on the phone.

THEY DEBITED MY DEBIT CARD FOR A ITEM THEY DIDNT HAVE IN STOCK AND I NEVER EVEN RECEIVED. THEY LIE. AND WHEN I CANCELED THE PRE ORDER THEY HELD ON TO MY FUNDS STILL FOREVER..IT TOOK ME GOING TO MY BANK TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST THEM FOR FRAUD TO FINALLY GET MY MONEY BACK! DONT DO BUSINESS WITH WALMART.COM THEY ARE FRAUD AND LIARS ...A VERY DISHONEST COMPANY! FRAUD LIARS! NO DIGNITY NO CLASS AT ALL THIS WALMART.COM SHOULDN'T EVEN BE IN BUSINESS!
2935,47181,Customer,29/05/2017,Walmart,"On April 29, I bought a custom made blanket from here, and the process of making it was kind of annoying, which was okay because it's not their fault. So after I purchased it, I checked to see when it was going to arrive, because since it was a birthday present, I wanted to make sure it arrives before my friend's birthday, which was May 5. I saw that it said the most likely delivery date was going to be May 9th, so thinking that it might be faster if I send it to my local Walmart, (so they could print it there, and I pick it up), I did. And thats when I wait, waiting, waiting, waiting. It is now May 10, AFTER my friend's birthday and I keep trying to check the status of the blanket but it just says ""Processing"". I have not gotten any email update, or any email saying there was difficulty with my product (which is extremely understandable because mistakes always happen). So I'm pretty annoyed by now since I waited 11 days for my item but it was still stuck at ""processing"". So I decide to go on the Walmart live chat and just see what was going on. (I recommend going on a live chat, rather than a call because it is just more efficient and less likely to receive ""bad customer service""). And I chat with them, probably over 30 minutes) to see what was going on with my package, and they tell me that the package had an error so it never finished processing, and so they just cancelled it and gave me a refund just now. I was understanding and grateful for the customer service because they explained to me. But the thing is, if I HADN'T come forth with the error with my package, I would've still been waiting for an email or something about it. I just think that if the product has an error, the customer should be notified of it."
2936,45128,Gil,29/05/2020,Walmart,"Low low level store with the most horrible CS. They have closed their fitting rooms due to corvid telling clients to check fitting at home and replace as needed, so we did. Now trying to replace some of the non fitting items they tell us they don't replace anything until further notice. Called the store manager and she said that if I don't remember the name of whoever told me that then she will not replace them... LOL Insanity and stupidity at its best. I'm done with Walmart after 20 years of loyalty... they are really dropping the ball lately"
2937,45129,CHARLENE JACOBSON,29/05/2020,Walmart,"We are behind a Wal-Mart in Lancaster ca. I posted a review about how well they did here and how horrible it was in bullhead city az. So I've been sitting here in the heat for 30 minutes and no sign of my groceries. Also, 2 hours before pickup they notified me of items I ordered not in stock. Totally unacceptable. Will start shopping at winco."

2939,45131,Deez Nutz,29/05/2020,Walmart,Avoid using Walmart at all costs. Their return policy is how they are making up for loss from covid-19. They are not doing exchanges or returns until the unforeseeable future. So they will hold onto your money and build the interest in their accounts for the next 3 to 6 months. Holding the money of millions of customers that are already struggling just to make more profit is downright scumbag and dirty of Walmart. They are knowingly selling defective food products and Walmart is not willing to correct the issue in any way.
2940,45132,Scott Cooper,29/05/2020,Walmart,"Ordered a product 5 weeks ago online from a third party seller. Product has not arrived and countless emails have gone unanswered and what is worse Walmart customer service reps were ignorant and uninformed. One rep rudely hung up on me while another transferred me back into the main queue and the third rep simply lied to me by telling me my package would be delivered within the next few days. The package she was referring to was still at customs in Vancouver and she would have not known that at that time.  In short, Walmart has hired lying buffoons to help their loyal customers. I will not shop at Walmart until they fix this issue. Wayfair gets my business  Scott"
2941,45133,Ms Mercedesk,29/05/2020,Walmart,"In the midst of COVID Walmart had this cycle for $98.99. I called & after being put on hold for 47 minutes they said it was on clearance & ""out of stock"". It wasn't returning therefore, I couldn't be put on backorder lists. They adviced to try my local stores. I spent a long weekend calling & going to all my local stores in a 40 mile radius. Zilch! Nothing! The VERY next day, MONDAY, a friend called saying It was BACK on their website! I said what? I went online & sure enough miracles of miracles there it is! Except now 24 HOURS later it's for $199.99! I ordered it but the more I thought on it I felt conned! I called Walmart for an explanation. They said ""it just arrived"" & that it sold online ONLY. So why was I directed to the stores? No answer. Only ""Sorry"". After all the rigamarules I went through I feel walmart yanked it off their website only to jack up the price. That as a ""3rd party"" sold this they were unable to honor the 24 hours previous price. Adding insult to injury they offered a 10% off my next order. UNBELIEVABLE! I'm refusing delivery of this & will no longer shop Walmart. (And trust me when I tell you. I shopped A LOT at walmart) I'm going back to Target & Amazon. At least they honor their prices. This kind of horrid service shall become walmarts down fall. As a loyal customer I am seriously so very disappointed in Walmart."
2942,45134,Katrina Clarke,29/05/2020,Walmart,HORRIBLE.....OUT OF $300 AND AN IPAD  ordered iPad 4 weeks ago for a motherâ€™s day gift for my grandma and still waiting. Wish I wouldâ€™ve just paid an extra $100 and went through target. At least I would have had it 2 weeks ago. I guess they have to recover for all the stolen items due to becoming a DIY CHECK OUT type of store. People steal from them and then walmart steals from me. Nice but if I do what they did to me.... IM GOING TO JAIL. What a sorry excuse for a family store.
2943,45135,Michael Hanford,29/05/2020,Walmart,"Problem with delivery of my order by FedEx. Called Walmart, as, I got nowhere with FedEx! In four minutes, the young lady got FedEx on the phone (Iâ€™d waited 30minutes and no answer), found out that FedEx outright lied to me, placed a new order, and apologized (NOT Walmartâ€™s fault). A perfect example of the all-too-rare first class customer service!"
2944,45148,Gil,29/05/2020,Walmart,"Low low level store with the most horrible CS. They have closed their fitting rooms due to corvid telling clients to check fitting at home and replace as needed, so we did. Now trying to replace some of the non fitting items they tell us they don't replace anything until further notice. Called the store manager and she said that if I don't remember the name of whoever told me that then she will not replace them... LOL Insanity and stupidity at its best. I'm done with Walmart after 20 years of loyalty... they are really dropping the ball lately"
2945,45149,CHARLENE JACOBSON,29/05/2020,Walmart,"We are behind a Wal-Mart in Lancaster ca. I posted a review about how well they did here and how horrible it was in bullhead city az. So I've been sitting here in the heat for 30 minutes and no sign of my groceries. Also, 2 hours before pickup they notified me of items I ordered not in stock. Totally unacceptable. Will start shopping at winco."
2946,45150,Aneisha Cooper,29/05/2020,Walmart,Walmart has the best customer service team.
2947,45151,Deez Nutz,29/05/2020,Walmart,Avoid using Walmart at all costs. Their return policy is how they are making up for loss from covid-19. They are not doing exchanges or returns until the unforeseeable future. So they will hold onto your money and build the interest in their accounts for the next 3 to 6 months. Holding the money of millions of customers that are already struggling just to make more profit is downright scumbag and dirty of Walmart. They are knowingly selling defective food products and Walmart is not willing to correct the issue in any way.
2948,45152,Scott Cooper,29/05/2020,Walmart,"Ordered a product 5 weeks ago online from a third party seller. Product has not arrived and countless emails have gone unanswered and what is worse Walmart customer service reps were ignorant and uninformed. One rep rudely hung up on me while another transferred me back into the main queue and the third rep simply lied to me by telling me my package would be delivered within the next few days. The package she was referring to was still at customs in Vancouver and she would have not known that at that time.  In short, Walmart has hired lying buffoons to help their loyal customers. I will not shop at Walmart until they fix this issue. Wayfair gets my business  Scott"
2949,45153,Ms Mercedesk,29/05/2020,Walmart,"In the midst of COVID Walmart had this cycle for $98.99. I called & after being put on hold for 47 minutes they said it was on clearance & ""out of stock"". It wasn't returning therefore, I couldn't be put on backorder lists. They adviced to try my local stores. I spent a long weekend calling & going to all my local stores in a 40 mile radius. Zilch! Nothing! The VERY next day, MONDAY, a friend called saying It was BACK on their website! I said what? I went online & sure enough miracles of miracles there it is! Except now 24 HOURS later it's for $199.99! I ordered it but the more I thought on it I felt conned! I called Walmart for an explanation. They said ""it just arrived"" & that it sold online ONLY. So why was I directed to the stores? No answer. Only ""Sorry"". After all the rigamarules I went through I feel walmart yanked it off their website only to jack up the price. That as a ""3rd party"" sold this they were unable to honor the 24 hours previous price. Adding insult to injury they offered a 10% off my next order. UNBELIEVABLE! I'm refusing delivery of this & will no longer shop Walmart. (And trust me when I tell you. I shopped A LOT at walmart) I'm going back to Target & Amazon. At least they honor their prices. This kind of horrid service shall become walmarts down fall. As a loyal customer I am seriously so very disappointed in Walmart."
2950,45154,Katrina Clarke,29/05/2020,Walmart,HORRIBLE.....OUT OF $300 AND AN IPAD  ordered iPad 4 weeks ago for a motherâ€™s day gift for my grandma and still waiting. Wish I wouldâ€™ve just paid an extra $100 and went through target. At least I would have had it 2 weeks ago.

2952,36294,Tamara D.,29/05/2018,Amazon Go,"Friendly staff, first timer here and helped me get in with my stroller.  It is a bit tight spaced when it's crowded so bring your baby carrier and skip the stroller!    I liked the selection of ready to eat snacks, lots of drink choices.  They have beer and wine too.  The only downside was there was no baby food.  And that's really not that much of a downside.    They're giving away free reusable totes for a limited time so come now to get yours.  You'll need it if you're grabbing more than a couple things.    The best thing that stood out to me was the reasonable prices.  I filled up an entire tote with snacks and drinks and treats and it only cost me $16!  They do not mark up the prices like other grocery places downtown which is awesome.  Things were cheaper than back home at my local grocery store.  My son thought it was the coolest place so we will be back."
2953,36363,Nick S.,29/05/2019,Amazon Go,"It's in an amazon district so it feels like you're in a suburb surrounded by boring people. Being in amazon districts in Seattle also have a mall vibe about them. Everyone over there dresses and looks the same. It makes it hard to enjoy it. Amazon should have moved into Bellevue, they would have fit in well."
2954,43100,Thomas Barry,29/05/2021,Walmart,Service has always suffered at Walmart locations. Now they suffer a lack of employees. Due to the government and their lack of paying employees. So now the service is worse the lines are longer and Walmart keeps profiting. I'm no longer spending my money at Walmart. I'll go somewhere I get treated nice and spend my money.
2955,43101,Kenneth A,29/05/2021,Walmart,"I find it TOTALLY offensive that Walmart store #2205 allowed a black employee to wear a shirt while at work on duty stating, ""I'M ROOTING FOR EVERYONE BLACK"" on Saturday, May 29th, 2021. This needs to be addressed. Racism comes from ALL directions!!!"
2956,43102,the og st st,29/05/2021,Walmart,"Walmart is the worst when it comes to online orders for pickup. Target, order is ready within 20 minutes.

2957,43103,ABM Ontario,29/05/2021,Walmart,"I ordered through walmart.ca and paid through walmart.ca. Their return policy states any product $150.00 or less sold and shipped by a third party can be returned at walmart stores. I received the car wash solution spilled all over the bag it was packaged in. I chatted with customer service who told me the product is final sale and would not be taking back the item. I said it was never indicated anywhere that it was final sale and I never would have purchased it if it was final sale. She said the third party will contact me within one business day. I said I bought this through walmart.ca and was charged by walmart, that walmart had no issue charging me this product but when I received this product damaged, they cannot help me resolve this and I'll have to wait for the third party seller to contact me. walmart said this is their policy. Business practice to charge customers and not care about customer's issues with the purchased products as long as they get your money. Hopefully Better Business Bureau can help me."

2962,40598,Jill Leone,29/05/2022,Walmart,"On two different occasions, when I ordered online and was sent confirmation I am then notified that the items and are not available! One time, I went to the store after receiving a pick up notice ,waited for a while using the app, and decided to go in the store and wait some more. I was told that items were not available! To make matters worse, I went into the store and found the items in stock which were twice the amount of money! I contacted customer service and was told that they would be returning after they investigated. Receive no refund and no call! Amazon is far more efficient !"

I tried to return it the next day. Although they poise a 90 day return policy. They do not honor it. They refused the return."
2964,40600,AnnieW,29/05/2022,Walmart,I had a very horrible experience with two Representatives from walmart.com. the first person whose name was cordaja actually hung up on me when I was trying to explain my situation. I was not being rude in any way. The next representative was an actual manager. Her name is Roxanna and she refused to refund me for a product that I was charged twice for. She was very unprofessional. This was actually the first time I called Walmart for a refund and usually representatives are supposed to look at the background of this kind of History to see if I'm able to get a refund or not and she did not do that I do not believe that she is an ethical person she may need more coaching for this position.
2965,40601,Cari,29/05/2022,Walmart,Walmart.com has the worst service ever. Do not order from Walmart.com if you cancel your order as it processing they will still charge you and make you send it back with your own money or tell you not to worry about it and charge your credit card a month later. Order through Amazon where it is easier and convenient. Walmart has the worst customer service ever they are rude and have no understanding of nothing. It is a list of problems with Walmart.com and I believe they will never fix it. A bunch of morons.

2976,36271,Jeff L.,30/05/2018,Amazon Go,"The Amazon Go store was quite the experience.  Luckily, one of my friends in my traveling party had visited earlier in the day and gave us the breakdown of how it all worked so we were ready to go.  We made sure we had the app ready to go on our phones prior to getting to the store itself.    Walking into the store was almost like a grab and go convenience store set up but with some subway turnstiles.  You scan your QR code via the app when you enter and you're ready to go.  The store itself is fairly small but there's a variety of some household grocery items on the right side of the store, and then a lot of packaged ready to eat things on the left hand side.  There's some cool Amazon Go store exclusive items that they have at the store that would be great souvenirs.  They had tumblers, mugs, and chocolate bars.  You take anything that you want and once you're done, you leave the store.  Through the magic of technology, they know exactly what you took and what you put back. In about 10 minutes or less you'll have an emailed receipt of what items you had taken and what was charged to the credit card that was linked to the Amazon account/app.  The app didn't accept my gift card balance as a form of payment but it had to be a credit card.  Overall, this store is very efficient and convenient.  There wasn't a wait to check out and this place easily could have been chaotic with crazy lines with how many people were in there if this was a traditional market.  There were It's a wide range of shoppers that were in here including people that worked in offices nearby, construction workers that are working on the next big building across the street, and I'm sure many tourists such as myself checking the store out.  I wonder when they'll start rolling these stores out in other cities.  This probably works best in a city setting where there's just the right amount of foot traffic."

2978,43097,Chris Hamlin,30/05/2021,Walmart,I would rate zero if possible two time one couldn't find a TV they had 20 of on their shelf and then the 2 items I had with it they put in a totally different car because they can't tell what numbers are and then I give a days notice for pick up for what they had in stock and then it gets canceled then next morning and the crappy thing is they hold your money just to not give you your stuff this is the dumbest stuff I have ever been thru like everyone should stick to amazon changing because it was definitely in-stock I went in and bought it they are crazy
2979,43098,Princess Annabelle,30/05/2021,Walmart,A month ago me and my roomate went shopping with our money and a customer in front of us forgot to cancel his order.  He was also upset at them too cause they assumed we were stealing.  I'm sorry we flipped out on them but its places like this that give me flashbacks.  This was very disrespectful and discriminatory how this store treated him and I really was on self check out trying to help my friend pay for his food.  He is disabled and sometimes i go with him to help him pay.  I do not appreciate how your staff stands over the customers like were all criminals.  Please tell your staff to ease up on the customers.  Some of us used to work retail too and we quit because of people like that who worship there staff but ignore the needs of the customers.  They have way to many self check outs and not enough carts. It is ridiculous. That is not customer service. That is discrimination. Grow up walmart.
2980,43099,NDIrishfan â€œNDIrishfanâ€,30/05/2021,Walmart,Walmart.com has gotten so bad that you see more 3rd party merchandise than you do Walmart. I do not go to Walmart.com to buy from sellers already on Amazon and Ebay. You cannot even filter them out. It always lists them 1st and Walmart stock last. No wonder Amazon is so much better. At least Amazon lists their items 1st then the 3rd parties. Hey Walmart if I want to shop 3rd parties I can go to Ebay or many other seller sites. Walmart should always list their products 1st. What I see happening now is 3rd party sellers using bots to buy up all the hot products and then selling at scalper prices on the same site. Walmart is aweful now. If you go into a Walmart its cluttered up and there is never any help around. They now want you to self check out and I have done just that. I have Self checked out of Walmart period!
2981,40590,Anthony Romero,30/05/2022,Walmart,"I don't like the online store, every time I make a purchase there is a problem, it can be with the shipping, with the stock, with the price or they just cancel the purchase without notice. I love the physical store."
2982,40591,N V,30/05/2022,Walmart,"I wish I could give them zero. There is a manager Muhammad he is the worst. He was so rude and bad to talk with. They had an item available online and when it came to delivery they said unavailable. I wasted two hours fighting for milk being available at the online and not delivered. They did not do anything to recompense it, I am a customer of Walmart delivery and revery week I order from Walmart. From this experience I don't want to order anything with them. Amazon really knows how to treat their customers right. Walmart you will not be getting my business."
2983,40592,Kristy Gorman,30/05/2022,Walmart,I really dislike Walmart online if you do store pick up tells you have everything be ready in hrs. You get there to o it's going to be tomorrow. Or if have it mailed it's supposed to be here one day always gets delayed for some reason never the 2 or 3 days promised. I have tried using Walmart online 5 times now only 1 time did it work right or get my stuff when I was supposed to. Very very unimpressed with it !!!

2986,40595,marlene harris,30/05/2022,Walmart,Ordered groceries select delivery. In Delivery preference I added directions as this is always an issue. Receive 1st text order is on the way approximate arrival time. Next I receive an email order is out for delivery etc. it showed in tracking order 18 mins. Driver Travel time. 3 mins away driver calls he doesnâ€™t speak English I reply â€œno hablo espaÃ±olâ€œ remember what driver is calling about is in the delivery preference . I did my best to indicate the Main Street he was to turn on he replied ok and hung up 3 mins away 5 mins goes by and tracking ends in between the time we hung up I sent Spanish text to update driver(Spanish translator)! After 45 mins of waiting I called Walmart to be told order was delivered back to store & canceled . What poor services it leaves me the customer to reorder the same items while my payment for a refund is being refunded what if thatâ€™s my only money. Itâ€™s not fair to the customer to wait several days for a refund itâ€™s been cleared on walmart end they have confirmed & cancel the order. I know everyone needs a job We also have to make sure their subcontractors have people who can speak or comprehend In order to have a successful delivery. This happens a lot Walmart loses if the order is delivered to the wrong address or return because the driver canâ€™t find the correct address. A lost and not to mention the client. Since this all started itâ€™s the worst service when dealing with Walmart and they donâ€™t care . They have the means to sub with companies to put in place better delivery protocol and a faster turn around of refunding customers that paid with their bank or credit card within 3 hrs as their other methods of payment. Im very upset with this process. And I have to reorder and hope tomorrow they can get my order delivered! Thumbs down Walmart!
2987,40596,Wil Clarke,30/05/2022,Walmart,"May 29, 2022  Message 1: â€œYour Walmart delivery has arrived! Chanelle will leave your order at your door. No need to sign!â€ Message 2, a minute or so later: â€œSome of your Walmart items were delivered on Sat May 28 at 9:13 a.m. View a photo of your delivery at â€¦â€ The photo showed a wall covered with a rack-facade and a bench in front of it with a plastic bag of goods. Walmart has recently proved to be significantly faster by a day or more than either e-Bay or Amazon. This time Chanelle outdid herself. Only one problem! She delivered it somewhere else! My house doesnâ€™t have a stone faÃ§ade, nor a brown bench. I phoned Walmart the next day and spoke with Rana who had an Asian accent. I explained what had happened. He put me on a long hold. When he finally came back, he asked if he could refund my money. I suspect he checked Googleâ€™s picture of the front of my house and saw that indeed this isnâ€™t a picture of my house. We did some sleuthing. Google Maps boldly and erroneously labels the house behind my house on a different street, with my address. That house has a setup as shown in the picture. But its number is not the number in the address and is on a different street than mine. Obviously, Chanelle didnâ€™t read my address: she simply, blindly believed Google and delivered my order to that house. That part of my order was not vital. The outstanding item in the order is vital and is to be delivered in a day or two. Iâ€™m hoping that Chanelle isnâ€™t chosen to deliver that one, too!"

I tried really hard to find something I would want to buy but 1) there isn't much selection; and 2) everything is really expensive. I ended up buying a yogurt and some vegetarian sausages just to have the complete experience. I did get a free Amazon bag, so that was pretty cool. I just wish the store was bigger."

They continue to have several cash registers that aren't staffed, you can hardly find help and when you do, they tell you they don't work in ""that"" department. Lines are long and many of the stores are unkept. Does Walmart even come here to read these reviews? I'd like to know if Walmart even cares?"
2997,43096,Ryan S,31/05/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a set of tires to be delivered to a nearby store location for pickup. The shipment was delayed a week and a half. It said online they had been delivered to the store, but when I called the store they had no record of them having arrived. This order was then refunded to me and a new set of tires was ordered with a 10% discount for the inconvenience. The discount part was at least something. But with this second order, there were yet again logistical problems. The website said they had been delivered to the store, but the store checked the back room and did not find my tires. Again they said contact the website. I called walmart.com again and politely explained how frustrating this whole experience had been, which had taken almost a month, and I had nothing to show for it. They said they would refund my order. Apart from this, the maximum compensation they said they were able to give me was a promo code to ""spend $45 dollars on the website, get a $25 dollars off"". Now ask yourself, does this sound like it makes up for all the wasted time waiting for nothing, the phone calls with representatives that had no idea where the tires were, the bouncing back and forth between the website and the brick and mortar store, etc? For me, this waste a serious waste of time, and the promo code compensation a shrugged off gesture with very little substantive value."
2998,40585,nakesia saulsberry,31/05/2022,Walmart,I always shop online at Walmart. Sometimes I go to the store. I order mostly groceries. I have it delivered to my apartment. The drivers are lousy. They will deliver your groceries and put them on the sidewalk. I told them to bring the food inside. My groceries was stolen. Somebody walked by and took it. They didn't bring the food to my door. Left it on outside on the sidewalk.
2999,40586,MrNugua,31/05/2022,Walmart,I want to love their online service. I really do. But 3/4 of the items I need to order are constantly out of stock. Or they won't ship them.  Sorry Walmart. I really did want to utilize your service but it needs improving.
3000,40587,Boom Ona,31/05/2022,Walmart,I had given a 1 before for the rude staff. On 2nd thought I'll give a 3 on account of the place being tidy and clean. Restroom didn't have an awful smell either. In guiding the stag effort hag a bad night or just didn't wish to be there.
3001,40588,V.A. RCE,31/05/2022,Walmart,"Was charged 98 dollars for a yearly delivery service that I did NOT sign up for. I don't know how it happened but my bank account is 98 dollars lower today because of it. It took a struggle to finally get a customer service rep to issue a refund that I am supposed to see with 3 to 5 business days, I'll believe it when I see it. Walmart says it is all up to my bank as when and if I receive it. Should never have been charged in the first place. I removed my payment method from my account and will never use them again."
3002,40589,Brandon M,31/05/2022,Walmart,"Great prices but, bad quality products that break easily after using for few months."

3004,47098,diana rodrigues,13/06/2018,Walmart,im so upset with walmart that i dont think im gonna use their website ever again ! they have other companies between them and if you wanna send ur item back you have to deal with this 3 parties companies this is so upsetting horrible customer service !
3005,46728,Joe,13/06/2019,Walmart,"Pharmacy is a joke. Waiting 4days for my medication. The only pharmacy that needs codes to fill your prescription. They say they are going to help you,by the time they get back to you your prescription is cancelled. Do Not Get Your Pain Medicine From Walmart Pharmacy. If you do you will be sorry."
3006,46729,ingersollwe,13/06/2019,Walmart,"Last night at 11:30PM I found a squat rack that was a 'roll back'. I attempted to purchase this on walmart.com several times last night but every time I clicked proceed to checkout I would receive an error message. Now it was late and there was no timer that I could see that would indicate the squat rack offer would expire, so I figured I would go to bed and order them in the morning. Well this morning (6 and a half hours later) I go on to order them and the squat racks are no longer 'roll back', increasing the cost by 10 bucks. I then contacted customer support hoping to receive the previous pricing since it was less than 24 hours old. The representative informed me that Walmart prices go up and down and to check back later because Walmart could not honor previous prices...  First of all, I have dumped thousands of dollars into Walmart over the years and have had mostly decent experiences. For such a large Organization to not honor their own prices is ridiculous. I've heard several other stores have honored previous pricing in situations like this, but I suppose that's because they value customers.  Second, I am not the kind of person that enjoys messing around with price watching. When I need something I need it, and don't have time to sit and see what happens.  After this experience I plan to still get these squat racks, but I will most likely purchase them on Amazon. I'm sure nothing will happen because of this review, but I just want people to be aware in the event you see a product that is considered a 'roll back'."
3007,46730,Andrew Messina,13/06/2019,Walmart,Worst store I have ever tried to shop at. Got lied to over and over and over and then sent to two different store locations 4times . I am a disabled man and feel like I have been played a game with the employees. Phillip the store manager at pier park is an jerk attitude that did not want to waste his time to help me with my situation. Amber the manager at location 818 tried to help but told me a lie that pier park would help. Panama City beach Florida is the worst !!
3008,45035,Amar,13/06/2020,Walmart,"Be careful with your purchases! Without notice, Walmart is no longer accepting returns on food and some other items . . . Taking advantage of Covid19 to get richer!"
3009,45036,N.M.,13/06/2020,Walmart,"I ordered a chair for $200. online at walmart. The chair showed that there were 4 in stock and it would be delivered in a week. A week later i got an email saying that they item was out of stock and they cancelled my order. I went back to the online site and the chair was still there, but the price had been doubled to $400. They wanted me to re-order at double the price. I have reached out to them but only got one reply saying that due to high demand they were out of stock. This is bull. They still show 4 of the chairs in stock at the new price."
3010,45037,SJohnson,13/06/2020,Walmart,"Today I spent almost $300 using the delivery grocery service. My order was NOT delivered to my home yet it showed delivered on the app. There is no direct phone # or chat to customer service, I had to google it. I finally spoke to a csr who told me they would reach out to the store directly and the result was my order would be delivered within 2 hours. It wasn't! Now I'm nervous. I called back asking for refund, I was informed that because it was over $50 the matter had to be escalated. I asked for supervisor or manager, was informed that they do not speak with customers directly, it would only be escalated and decided with a callback. The only thing the csr could do was reach out to the store a 2nd time for order status, again, informed that order will be delivered but they need a driver. I called the store and offered to pick it up, was told ""no, we already ordered the driver is there anything else""? Her tone was so nasty and Im so disgusted with this experience. Also several of the gluten free items were substituted with reg items, which is a waste. I will just have to go back to shopping at several stores."
3011,45038,M-G Alfano,13/06/2020,Walmart,"Today I received a package with the wrong item. Looking up that item, it was discontinued which is most likely why the substitution was made from that ordered. Upon contacting the Online department, going to the store and speaking to the return associate, then the floor super, and finally the manager, ""Nothing can be done."" If you order from the online department you may not be able to get satisfaction. Walmart says their computer system prevents the return and only through the contract company can one expect the right package. A bait and switch is obvious, give your possible unsuspecting customer something you had for a while as they won't know. But, often we do. Compare this store with A... and C..., any number of others too numerous to name. Buy elsewhere, receive what you ordered and get customer service rather than customer no service, receipt or not. This company online dept doesn't even deserve a 1. So, customers, buyer be ware."
3012,45039,Laura B,13/06/2020,Walmart,"I'd give a negative star, if I could. I ordered a piece of furniture from these clowns. When it didn't come by the promised date I called, only to be told, ""That's a different seller. We can't help you."" Seriously?!?!? You'll sell it on your site under your name, but you won't take any responsibility for it? Homesquare is the third-party seller from whom the furniture was supposed to come, and if you look them up you'll see they rate about one star everywhere on the web. Shame on you, Walmart.com, for doing business with companies who don't come through, and for refusing to stand behind what you sell!"
3013,47096,Candyce,14/06/2018,Walmart,"Been a Walmart customer (in the store and online) for more than 12 years. I have let them know many times of recent frustrations in my local 99362 store with poor management, they never bother to respond with anything other than the corporate ""we are sorry, blah blah"". They are so huge the frustrations of one customer does not bother them. Online, they do have fast, free shipping after 39.00 but the website is clunky, slow and full of errors. Often, the descriptions are just not there or inaccurate. It is unfortunate that I live in a very rural area and have to drive 65 miles round trip, so guess I am stuck with good old WM."

3015,46725,Jason Mulkey,14/06/2019,Walmart,Ordered of Walmart.com. they go through 3 parties to supply your stuff. And charge you a restocking fee and shipping fee for each individual item. Then through them all in the same box. It's not right. And you dont get stuff from Walmart. Its places in China. Not even any return tags on them. Or size tags
3016,46726,Judy Tipp,14/06/2019,Walmart,"Went to the Walmart on Sanderson in Hemet CA to get a tire replaced. My husband checked with them the day before to make sure they had the tire size we needed and they told him they opened at 7a the next day. We arrived at 655a and got our car in line. Cars were lining up behind us but they hadnâ€™t opened yet. At 730a myself and another lady starting calling the store to see if there was a problem. No answer, it just rang for about 3 minutes then disconnected. We both called 10 times and same result. Finally around 8a I walked around to the front of the store and asked for a manager. A girl said she was the front end manager. I asked about the auto shop. She said they donâ€™t open until 8a. I said the sign in the door says 7a. She walked away from me. So I walked to the interior auto department and found the manager. He said most of his staff didnâ€™t show up, only one mechanic. At this point he and the mechanic opened the bay doors and advised everyone that it would take one hour per car and they would start with me since I was there first. They wrote me up and took my keys. I went inside to shop. After an hour I returned to the auto shop and my car had not been touched. Now their story was they cannot change a tire without a second mechanic on the premises pee California state law. I verified this and it is not true. At this point Iâ€™d been there 2 and a half hours so just said give me my keys, Iâ€™m done. They were rude and unprofessional. Laughing at the customers who were all upset at this point. A women who said she was the shop assistant manager showed up and instigated all kinds of anger amongst the customers that were still there. I went to take a photo of her name tag so I wouldnâ€™t forget her name and she completely flipped out of me. Started yelling at me that it was illegal to take a video. I said oh, I wasnâ€™t taking a video but I will now. She completely lost it. She put her hand up to block my phone. It was crazy! I finally got my keys and left. I called to register a complaint with Walmart customer service. They advised the the store general manager would call me in 3 days. I waited 2 weeks and no call so I contacted them back. I was advised that my behavior was inappropriate so he refused to call me. Inappropriate? For taking a video? Donâ€™t ever do business here. I for one will never shop at any Walmart again"

3018,45032,Arqui,14/06/2020,Walmart,"So, I went into this store today (12236 Montana Ave El Paso, TX 79938) looking for a robovac. The one I wanted was locked, so I asked someone for help. As I asked this person, he immediately continued walking and said that he didnâ€™t have the key and that he would call someone. About 10 min passed by, no one showed up and neither the person that â€œwas going to called someone.â€ Another employee approached me and asked if I needed help, he said that he is going to customer service to see who has the key. CS came up in the loud speaker saying customer needs assistance in the vacuum department. He returned, saying someone would be there shortly. After about 15 mins waiting there, I walked to CS and explained the situation. An employee called for someone from that department to come to customer service and again no one showed up. She went to talked to her supervisor and the supervisor asked her to get my name and phone number and they would contact me back because they donâ€™t have the key. ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾â€â™‚ï¸ no one likes people wasting their time. If it is for you to have certain merchandises locked, either make sure that someone is available at all time with the key on the floor or leave those merchandises unlocked"
3019,45033,M FR,14/06/2020,Walmart,"Walmart's customer service is designed to steal money. If they make a mistake in on order, they make the customer fix it or they will not issue a refund. I spent two weeks trying to get them to resolve an order I canceled immediately because the $70 in expedited shipping was worthless. I paid to have an item delivered fast. They then emailed me to say it would arrive five days later, after I'd moved 3000 miles away. They expected me to go pick up the item and return it before issuing a refund. Their customer service is a complete waste of time and obnoxious with their cute little ""nice day"" attempts. Meanwhile, they cause problems they won't fix and then keep the money. SCUM BAG company."
3020,45034,Amanda Rifenburgh,14/06/2020,Walmart,I ordered a class ring for my daughter online. Waited a month nvr got ring. Order was cancelled but they took the money out of my account. I called they said they nvr got the money. Called my bank and they said it was paid. Bank gave me a good faith and put it back in my account and went after walmart for money. Walmart nvr paid my bank. They took the money back ouT of my account and bounced every one of my pending charges. I tried calling walmart no answer or the run around. By the time I got anyone my account was negative $407.16 walmart apologize said they would hve my $80 put back and gove me a $25 gift card but would not take care of all the other charges they caused. They told me they felt they were taking care of their part n were nice enough to give me that crappy gift card. Needless to say now im goin to contact a lawyer n will never shop that store again Meijers all the way! If I had stolen $80 in merch from their store it would be all charges pressed against me b miney id pay in fines but its ok for them to steal from me.

I was so excited to check out the Go store with my friend from out of town after hearing that the store has open. After all, nobody else has cashier-less and check--out-less process in the world today! :D  It was so fun to see how cool technology can be integrated smartly into everyday life and, better, help bring our lives even more efficiencies!  My friend and I had fun checking out the store, the food selection and...we even tried to engi-nerd some confusing use cases to see if Amazon system could get the billing wrong! But no, they got all the systems done right!!  Great idea and super well executed concept! I would love to see this store expand to other areas...and also..more selection beyond food...and cover the whole supermarket selection!"

3023,47094,MichaelB,15/06/2018,Walmart,Walmart performed like they said. They where true to their word regarding getting a warranty issue solved. A few months ago I was moving and hired a moving company. Once the moving was completed we started to get our new home situated. We turned the TV on and unfortunately the screen was cracked internally. We called Walmart where I purchased the TV/warranty and they told me the steps I needed to do. Within 15 minutes I had completed the warranty paperwork and a new TV was on its way. The TV was delivered within a week.The new TV was similar but had more features for which I was satisfied. I would recommend Walmart to purchase any TV and also the warranty to which they back.

I expected a delay in delivery due to Covid-19, however, upon checking on my walmart order history, items were said to be delivered! You can imagine my surprise as patio furniture would be a hard one to miss on your front step!  I contacted walmart's customer service. They saw that it was delivered and suggested I ask a neighbor or family member to see if they had it. Really?! Patio furniture? It's not a small box. I was, like most of the world, AT HOME due to covid-19 so it was not delivered.  I called again! This time they suggested I file a police report or I would not get my refund!  I then called the shipping company and in their searches, they discovered that it hadn't even been documented there and concluded that it was never shipped to them! (I'll remind you that in my tracking, it had already said delivered to my door!)  I called walmart again!!! This time I spoke with a nice gentleman who said it was long enough and he would escalate a ticket to a supervisor who would contact me within the day or two so I gave him my cell phone number for contact purposes.  It is now a week later and I have not heard from anyone SO... I CALLED AGAIN! This time, I got someone who repeated the notes on file (I could tell her almost by heart right now). She told me that someone had already tried to reach out to me but there was no answer and no voicemail. *GRRRR Need I remind you that I gave my CELL PHONE NUMBER in case I go out to get milk or whatever and that my cell phone has voicemail attached!  I am beyond angry at this point and STILL HAVE NO patio furniture. Why am I writing all of this?  DON'T SHOP AT WALMART ONLINE!!!"

3036,40547,David M Mack,15/06/2022,Walmart,"This review is regarding my experiences with Walmart's online customer service. I have been shopping online since about 2014 for everything from housewares to clothing to craft supplies and everything in between. My purchasing picked up during covid and has increased recently because of the epidemic of street crime and gun violence in the city in which I live. Anyways, I have been making purchases from Walmart for grocery, craft supplies, and power tools and whenever there was/is the unavoidable hiccup their customer service has resolved the issue to my satisfaction. I feel so comfortable with my shopping experiences with them that I opened a Walmart credit account. I can not say enough about my positive experiences with the Walmart Customer Service Team. Thank you for reading this review and I hope that someone may find it useful."

Almost unbelievable.....so yeah that is it for me no more WalMart. They do not need paying customers at that particular store anyway."
3038,40549,Kathryn Torres,15/06/2022,Walmart,"Walmart.com is complete trash. Everything they are saying about not getting your order is completely true. I ordered some items and went ahead with the 30 day trial for the service. I got multiple emails and text messages that my order was on it's way and then that it was delivered the very next day I ordered. I thought, wow this is great. When I go check, there is no order. So I call and they say I need to look around to see if the order was left ""somewhere'. I need to go ask my neighbors to see if they received it instead. And the best part: I need to wait at least 48 hours before I can get a refund for my money for the order I never received that says ""delivered"". They told me that some carriers will mark an order delivered before it really is delivered. WHAT??? I never heard such nonsense in my life. They use the worst method possible, USPS. So the tracking information says my ordered was left in the mail parcel receptacle which means who knows if it was really delivered or someone got my order and never came clean. Total garbage. Their customer service people will pretend they check to see if they can refund your money but the answer is always NO. You will have to wait. When I called back after the required wait time, they now mark my order ""Lost"" which in their lingo means I might have received it but I am saying I did not. Do not fall for their advertising. This is a very subpar service. Stick with the mainstream competitor. I never any issues with them."

3040,40551,Karen Talarico,15/06/2022,Walmart,"Each visit to Walmart I get more and more frustrated. Service is horrendous. The self check outs are a joke! If your lucky there may be one cashier open and line ups at the self check out. Now most of the self checkouts are closed causing huge line ups for something we must do ourselves. Prices continue to go up double and triple what they were a few months ago. You pay your staff peanuts and expect your customers to do staffs job. Many products, cleaning supplies, condiments, some clothing etc are more reasonable ( less than 1/2 the price) in the Dollarama and dollar stores than Walmart. Which I have begun utilizing. Your fresh meats and selection of meats are something to be desired. For a few cents more it is now more cost effective to shop in places such as SaveOn. They provide a good variety of grocery selection and offer full service."

I explained to the people greeter and customer service that I was bringing back a product. I got to the desk of customer service to exchange the ceiling fan. I was refused the right to exchange it, because a sales associate lied to a manager and said that I cursed them out. I told the manager that it was not true. On the way out I explain to the supervisor that it was a lie. Talked to the sheriff on duty that followed me out the store and told him that the manager lied, she was not even present during the conversation that I had with the sales associate. I recently contacted Walmart corporate office and the police officer's superior. The officer told me that I was banned. I may just decide to contact the media. The way I was treated was unjustly and unnecessary."

Had to open and remove box from safe to review contents, Only to discover no key. So I have a locked cabinet I cannot open. Called Walmart customer service, guess what they wonâ€™t replace the key. Ok, I said return it. Ok they say, but it must be in a box to return it, I ask how do I do that? They say after escalating to their tier 2 sophisticated customer service, â€œthatâ€™s my problem, if I donâ€™t b0x it, I cant return itâ€.. they cared nothing that they short shipped an order and charged me, they cared nothing that they could simply get me a key.. and they certainly cared nothing about customer service. If I couldtnâ€™t Use something I got from them, they donâ€™t care. Itâ€™s like about Walmart policies. .... well, Iâ€™ll cancel the credit card payment and see them in small claims court before I get stuck with a gun safe I cannot open. My advice, donâ€™t purchase anything that requires opening from Walmart.com, because if you want to return it they make you pack it all up again for shipping. Little hard if you have to destroy the box to open it!"
3046,46721,Robert Cecil,16/06/2019,Walmart,People need to leave their pets at home. If you cannot go more than 1/2 hour to one hour without your pet then your life is pathetic
3047,46722,Tosha chewning,16/06/2019,Walmart,"I will never shop in Walmart again. They are not deserving of my hard earned money. They changed the garden center to a 20 items or less line all of a sudden and I didn't notice, so after waiting 15 minutes in line one of the employee's walks over and starts going through my basket and counting my stuff. I had 26 items and 7 of them were candy bars. The employee told me to leave the line. Rude nasty people!"
3048,45018,Jennifer Jackson,16/06/2020,Walmart,"Still waiting on my order from a couple months ago. They've actually cancelled orders before and not notified me in the past, so I'm not surprised. This time I put in for a refund. It says they'll send a mailing label for me to return item that were to arrive a 2 months ago and says delayed. Uhmm, I don't have them....ughhh"
3049,45019,Brandee,16/06/2020,Walmart,Bought Walmart grocery delivery 300 dollars worth. The doordasher delivered it to the wrong apartment. The tenants stole my groceries and split it between three people. Called the cops. They recovered some of the stuff but some was damaged. Walmart issued me a 39 dollar refund and took an 18 dollar delivery charge out. Now I'm without grocery money and groceries
3050,45020,Susan Obrien,16/06/2020,Walmart,"Ordered pharmacy supply, accepted order, told me delivery date June 12, no updates, last time I checked AFTER delivery date it was marked ""Canceled."" Thank heaven I did not really need this product immediately. Never ever will order from War Mart again."
3051,45021,Patty A Rodriguez,16/06/2020,Walmart,"Walmart has the worst website ever, information is never accurate... it show products available that are totally sold out weeks ago. Twice drove more than 1 hour and got there an everything was sold out two weeks ago!"
3052,45022,JoDeana Stafford,16/06/2020,Walmart,When Sam Walton first started Wal-Mart he told my roommate that if he just made a penny profit on what he sold he would be happy. He also asked him if he wanted to invest in his new business but my roommate didn't think much about it at the time. Now he wishes he had gotten in at the time. Sam Walton would turn over in his grave if he knew what was happening to the business he started now. They are now trying out a new concept at a store somewhere. There are no cashier's there are only self check out there. And they plan to do this in ALL STORES in the near future. Look at the thousands of people who will lose their jobs. If they continue to do this WE will stop shopping there even though it will cost us more money to do it.
3053,45023,Daniel Rockwell,16/06/2020,Walmart,"I ordered 2 game for my son for his birthday Splatoon 2 and Cuphead. Cuphead only came over night and the Splatoon 2 version just stayed there not processing I tried to chat with someone about this but they were no help. So if you try to order games from Walmart, try to do it at a decent time cuz they will of course *not do it*"
3054,45024,Bevers,16/06/2020,Walmart,"We just visited the Walmart in Deerfoot Meadows. There were 2 staff in the self checkout area - neither of them cleaned our terminal either before or after we checked out. They both appeared to just be standing around. Also, isnâ€™t Walmart a large enough store to have no contact credit card terminals?"
3055,45025,Regina Johnson,16/06/2020,Walmart,Returned an item that I purchased a week ago. It is customary to have money returned to card used however they already have my money so why should I have to wait 3 to 5 business days for refund when I was in store and requested cash immediately. I've been waiting for a supervisor to call me back to resolve this issue since 3 PM and it is 11 PM
3056,45026,Tony,16/06/2020,Walmart,"I was scammed by Walmart into buying two $500 Walmart/Sams gift cards. My Bad! Walmart adamantly refused to refund my money. Tried to use the gift cards to buy gas at Sams and they wonâ€™t work without spending more money on a membership card plus the gas is $0.15/gal higher than Costco. All in all, Iâ€™m stuck with $1000.00 of Walmart gift cards for a store I find absolutely nothing of value to purchase, expensive gasoline, and an attitude of extreme confrontation."
3057,36437,Lauren N.,16/06/2018,Amazon Go,This is a really interesting way to shop. Just scan in with the app. Grab what you need and walk out. I felt rushed when I was in the store. People were walking up and grabbing things so quickly I felt like I had to get out of the way vs shopping. I also didn't like that it took some time after we left to find out what we were charged for.
3058,36393,Kyle M.,16/06/2019,Amazon Go,"Regardless of the products offered, I think this is an awesome experience to have. I like how you can check your Amazon Go app after a visit and see what you took and how long you spent in the store (my record is 14 seconds). Aside from the novelty of it, this place is extremely convenient amidst a busy lunch scene in South Lake Union. Their offerings are pretty tasty as well. I would recommend the goat cheese and date salad and the egg salad sandwich."
3059,43027,Mckenzie,16/06/2021,Walmart,Poor customer service. Tried investing in crypto? Give a try to www. primetrustcoin.io . They are legit and genuine site with an incredible policy for payments. Iâ€™m getting much profit here
3060,43028,Moe Akhbari,16/06/2021,Walmart,I purchased tire twice it took 2 hours to put the on very unprofessional establishment I wouldn't shop there anymore they're either on cellphone or walking around went to another place took only 20 minutes
3061,43029,d miyazaki,16/06/2021,Walmart,horrendous. trying to return a spray that did not work. after fedex says CANNOT due to postal regulations. then walmart to say thank you for being a customer then deactivates my account.  never never will order anything more. dectivate a customer's account after attempting to return that fedex cannot accept ?
3062,43030,Customer,16/06/2021,Walmart,Order a pool june 1 was suppose to be HERE by june 15th here it is the 17th still no pool called walmart told them and all i got was a run around told me to just wait its summer and i paid over 2500 for shipping and the pool do not order from walmart they get your money then screw you around on delivery!
3063,43031,Kate Savoyard,16/06/2021,Walmart,I have not ordered any items online yet - prefer seeing things and having opportunity to touch them in order to see the true quality and try them on before buying. I love the variety and prices.
3064,43032,Harry Siew,16/06/2021,Walmart,"I wanted to buy a TV set, so I went to Walmart to look for one, but I went home without buying it - thinking that I could buy it cheaper elsewhere. But I returned the next day I saw the same unit were more affordable by 50 dollars! I quickly bought it.  So I guess if you think your item is not cheap enough, check the next day. Perhaps they are more affordable then :D"
3065,43033,Keshu MAINI,16/06/2021,Walmart,"Selected this company by thinking that it is one of the biggest name in US. Using web service, from U.K tried to send a family gift for brother's family in Round Rock, TX., After waiting for a week and talking to the courier company, come to know it's delivered to someone else as address labels messed up by the company. The customer support executive promised to delivered afterwards but then refused. A very big disappointment. Will never recommend to anyone to buy something from Walmart."
3066,40562,Tommy,16/06/2022,Walmart,They scrutinize your product reviews and if they don't like it they don't allow it to post so I don't review anything that I buy from them.
3067,45009,Lodye,17/06/2020,Walmart,"I have placed an order on March 12, 2020. and still haven't received it. contacted Walmart to cancel and refund my payment on May 15, 2020. as of today, still not receive money back. i called every second day to follow up. each person the the phone told me a different s*it of waiting another 2 days. it's completely bulls*it. my request has been escalated multiply times,,, now on hold waiting to talk to escalating team.. been on hold for more than an hour, i guess no one is dare to pick up my call any more. the worst shopping experience ever."
3068,45010,Jeanie Melton,17/06/2020,Walmart,"I went to the vision center in Walmart at Quinlan Texas 75474 to order some contacts . of course its all roped off you have to stand outside the rope for service. one lady is in there sitting at a computer didnt bother to look up when it was obvious she knew i was there. Shes been there for 50 years, needs to retire shes so rude. I told her the doctor personally brought my prescription over to them , which of course she couldnt find. im will never go in that sorry Walmart store again. Im white of course so i dont guess that discrimination. I have never been treated so rudely in my life. They will never have any business from me or my family again"
3069,45011,Eric Garvey,17/06/2020,Walmart,"I ordered a product online and they said that it was in stock and I could pick it up today. I then received a message stating that it had been delayed. About an hour later, I received a message stating that my order had been cancelled and that the item was no longer in stock. THANKS FOR WASTING MY TIME WALMART! I will now shop elsewhere!"
3070,45012,latoya james,17/06/2020,Walmart,"Every time I order online the order is cancelled. These people do not keep track of what is in stock so why they have online ordering, I have no idea. Will not order online any longer and I do not really shop there so no problem. HEB > Walmart!"
3071,45013,Maria,17/06/2020,Walmart,"The pharmacy at Walmart in Chicago Ridge is great. Not only do they have great employees working there but one of the employees specifically, Patrycja was kind enough to give me a big discount on my medications. Iâ€™m so pleased with the service I received."
3072,45014,bob,17/06/2020,Walmart,"This has been THE WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had any where!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Order COMPLETELY wrong. I ordered 5 tires for my trailer; all the same every thing; Load range ""d"", size 205-75-R15; same manufacture, and got 3 the wrong size, 1 with a lower load range than what I ordered and 1 that is about 3 size's bigger, different manufacture, different type ""off road"" I think. Customer service IS THEE WORST!! People on the other end don't speak or VERY little English, They do not understand you, They speak right over the top of you with out paying attention to you, Miserable gruesome experience. Walmart IS NOT worth the aggravation, buy else where, IT WILL BE WORTH IT!!!!!!!"
3073,45015,Rozanne Lamar,17/06/2020,Walmart,I Would rather do anything than walk in Walmart I hate going to walmart. The store is tired and the workers are unfriendly. They also never have enough people working in line There are workers there standing around doing nothing but the manager has told us standing in line before that walmart will not let him open extra check out lines. Walmart use to be great I love sams but I would rather go anywhere than go to Walmarts now.
3074,45016,Maria Damato,17/06/2020,Walmart,"Gave one star because there are no lower ratings available. If there was, I would have rated it -10. Customer service agents do not know what they are doing, at all. If you call 10 times, you will get 10 different answers. Need more training or placed on a different position."
3075,45017,Michael Apice,17/06/2020,Walmart,"Utter disgrace of a store.  I went to this â€œsuperâ€ store because it was on the way....what a mistake. Gotta be the dirtiest,, most disgusting and least welcoming Walmart Iâ€™ve been too. Just avoid this place at all cost."

This is basically a convenience store with a larger than normal selection of stuff. But here is the cool part, you come in and scan your Amazon Go app, you grab what you want... AND YOU WALK OUT! Itâ€™s really cool and amazing how it all works. Prices are normal and they have a good â€œbasicâ€ selection of stuff with some good prepared foods. Check it out if you have any interest in tech!"

3078,36209,Brian H.,17/06/2021,Amazon Go,"All of the Amazon Go locations have steadily declined to the point Amazon should be embarrassed.  This week I went to the Amazon Go at headquarters.  A lot of the shelves were empty, a common occurrence since they opened.  The prepared foods selection and quality has also gone down in quantity and quality.  At first they offered selections from local restaurants and food purveyors.  Now it's almost all Amazon brand, and we find the quality  of Amazon brand prepared foods similar to 7-11.    Complaints and feedback sent in online and delivered in person go unanswered."
3079,43019,Chris Flores,17/06/2021,Walmart,"Horrible customer service, a well as security who was more worried about his hair, not about the associates.  I ask about my online order and was directed to a 800 number who unfortunately was unable to answer my question about a refund due to the lack of limited acknowledgment of speaking English. Walmart Associates unable to fill my online order promptly. Will never again purchase online orders with Walmart due to the lack of courtesy by their employees."
3080,43020,Dinky Dee,17/06/2021,Walmart,Walmart publishers nice sales on their air conditioners online only. You order one online only on the date it's supposed to be delivered you can't find a tracking number but you call and they give you a 5% discount and sorry for the inconvenience but it's going to take 10 extra days to order it from a different location. You check back in 7 days and they've canceled your order without notification because they want you to now pay from 294 to 418 and buy it from the from the manufacturer who now offers it. They're not sure when they'll get it back in but they can hold you a rain check.
3081,43021,Shelia B,17/06/2021,Walmart,"I bought a battery Nov 2019 and this battery is now DEAD, took it back to Walmart for an exchange and I have my bank record of purchasing it, they wouldn't honor it!! Walmart is the worst!"
3082,43022,Jeremy Castello,17/06/2021,Walmart,"Walmart is luck to even to get 1 full star. Customers service horrible, I called 5 time and was hang up on 2 times.

3083,43023,Amber,17/06/2021,Walmart,my experience was really bad because non of the cloths were in my size and you're jewelry was crap and really ugly and the few good jewelry was really expansive and you guys had ZERO BBQ chips at the time and that made me really mad and i took my anger out on my kids. Also don't forget that BBQ is the best chips flavor
3084,43024,Laquan Webb,17/06/2021,Walmart,I purchased a pool with handy service only to get rescheduled 3 times. After putting it together myself having a hard time getting my refund. Already a month in Walmart now wants me to collect it from the service company purchased through them. Never again. Shop anywhere else people.
3085,43025,Kristin Driscoll,17/06/2021,Walmart,So I donâ€™t know if anybody else has ever experienced a Walmart customer service these days. But I know that the Walmart in Waverly Iowa is definitely lacking it. When did Walmart start not returning things after 8 oâ€™clock what if I can only go into Walmart at 9 oâ€™clock at night. I can buy something at nine but I canâ€™t return something at nine I canâ€™t make it in any other time so youâ€™re really gonna shut your customer service down at 8 oâ€™clock.? What do I need to find somebody to take my returns back for me because Walmart decided to start closing their customer service down at 8. Now checkout there is not a damnWorker on check out these days. Theyâ€™re all watching us as we work for them. What are we? what are they? They stand around and watch us check out. I Mean the customer service was already bad enough but now you walk in you donâ€™t even get greeted by anybody they sit there and watch you as you check out like youâ€™re a criminal. Thereâ€™s nobody to help you in any aisle when you actually do need it for a specialized spot in your store such as hunting. And then the other half of the time when you ask somebody something they have no clue where it is. Occasionally I do run into somebody that actually goes out of their way to get up off from what theyâ€™re doing and actually walk me over to what Iâ€™m looking for. Every single time I walk into Walmart in Waverley Iowa I am disgusted by what I see and Iâ€™m not the only one I can tell you that. I think Walmart needs to remember a little bit of customer skills when it comes to the customers in their store. Maybe instead of talking to each other and being in groups of three and four they could actually do something on the floor Ha that rhymes. I donâ€™t even know if I can be serious now because I mean it is ridiculous please if anybody feels the same way let let let me know I cannot stand Walmart the only reason why I go into it is because itâ€™s taking over the whole entire country and itâ€™s the only thing in my little small town and it sucks. Iâ€™m not just saying this because of one bad experience Iâ€™m saying this because of many bad experiences. They wouldnâ€™t sell me cigarettes it was 10:50 and Iâ€™m sorry but now because I could only go in at 10:50 having one leg they were going to make me go to another store to get cigarettes . Good thing for my lack of control and not being able to keep my mouth shut about some thing I see is not right. . I ended up getting my cigarettes but I know it wasnâ€™t A wanted sell for them since they have already shut down that area and counter down the drawer. . If there are only one spot to do a certain sale why would you close that one down before 1059. Because yes thatâ€™s more work for you to do youâ€™ve already counted down the drawer. Our world is turned to lazy lazy employees and people that are only allowing their own jobs to be taken away by robots basically I mean what good are you for your job if you donâ€™t even work when youâ€™re there. Your jobs are now mine. why am I not getting paid back for what I do at Walmart when Iâ€™m there half of the time I canâ€™t even get the right prices with the right things because theyâ€™re in the wrong places and then they make me wait what happened to Being free or discounted when it was in the wrong place. so now I have to wait another 15 minutes for the employees to all gather up and figure out this one is in the wrong place and it should be over here and then still try to charge me full price screw that this is all Iâ€™ve got folks if youâ€™ve had anything like this you know the stresses that I am feeling right now itâ€™s itâ€™s ridiculous I have to laugh.Iâ€™m sure I could probably get about 1000 different names of people I know that Iâ€™ve had the same experience at Walmart in Waverly Iowa maybe you should really start training your customer service skills again thank you people have a good night
3086,43026,Martin Sedano,17/06/2021,Walmart,Never buy from Walmart online is the worst place
3087,47335,Zalina Kirshat,18/06/2014,Walmart,"Seriously, I order all sorts of bulky items from them - TP, cat food, shampoos... They ship for free for orders over $50. Once an order came damaged (the shampoo leaked), and they did replace the shampoo. I am a fan!!!"
3088,45002,Yu Alec,18/06/2020,Walmart,"I wish I had a way to give a minus score. Walmart online is the worst that I had experienced.  It is unbelievable bad experience for us to deliver to Vancouver.  We bought 3 things online, one was sent with UPS after 3 weeks. UPS even does not attempt to reach to us although we leave all contact information. They simply dropped a slip. We have to go miles to reach to a limited hours UPS store.  The 2nd is even worse. It was a belt of $30. When it is delivered, the belt was completely broken. The package slip read "" please send to above address for return"" and there is no above address at all. I wrote to both walmart and the deliver vendor to whom we paid delivery fees with attached the images. They never came back.  The 3rd never reached to us.  So we would like to let you know so that you will not be robbed by Walmart like Walmart did to us."
3089,45003,Mary Kelly,18/06/2020,Walmart,Would not return item from 3rd party after 30 days even though returns were not being accepted at store because of covid-19. I tried to return day after I received the item. Awful service. Walmart.com did nothing and 3rd party did not respond to email. I will never shop on walmart.com again
3090,45004,Amanda H.,18/06/2020,Walmart,"I will only shop INSIDE a Walmart store, BUT NOT ONLINE via the Walmart Marketplace. They need to do a better job of vetting their third-party sellers who are doing a good job of scamming Walmart customers! BEWARE OF DEALS R US - an online Search of DEALS R US to include the search term ""Walmart"" will produce countless reviews by those who have been scammed by this seller, me included. You won't be able to contact this third-party seller - no working email or phone number. Walmart explained to me that they don't have address information for their third-party sellers. Thankfully I was able to request a refund of a purchase from DEALS R US, for an item which I never received. BUYER BEWARE!"
3091,45005,Tony Murillo,18/06/2020,Walmart,"Their inventory system is broken. They're allowing the overselling of items, giving phony delivery dates, and then once it's past the estimated delivery date, it will just sit on delayed indefinitely. I've spent a combined 3 months of waiting on two different items. I will never again shop on Walmart.com."
3092,45006,Richy,18/06/2020,Walmart,I bought 2 watches from Walmart online May 21 for delivery May 28. Today is June 18. Still no watches and still no refund. Despite numerous communications.
3093,45007,Lee Dodd,18/06/2020,Walmart,Walmart is getting to be worse than Amazon if that's possible. They don't care about their customers. Both have turned into a modern day corporate Ebay. They allow their sellers to price gouge their customers because there doesn't appear to be any oversight. This is very poor management and very bad customer service. I do believe I have just personally made my last purchase from Walmart. I'm tired of your order giving one delivery date and then when you follow up you get a totally different delivery date. It's not worth it anymore. Walmart isn't worth it!
3094,45008,Tawfik Salama,18/06/2020,Walmart,the worst on line service .... never again ... and for Walmart please take my email off your list i dont wish to receive any offers.... you have to take care of your customers first
3095,43011,Ange,18/06/2021,Walmart,"Walmart is usually pretty great especially with delivery. Today I received my order and the headache medication was in a bag alone, I put my hand in the bag to get it out and there was a slimy clear substance on the box and my hand. I just wanted to make sure I let you all know in case it was something harmful. I have a picture."
3096,43012,Donald Swanson,18/06/2021,Walmart,I was expecting Walmart to step up and offer significant competition to Amazon... IMO What we got was a half effort where every transaction leaves me a little disappointed. with all the hype I expected more.
3097,43013,Edith Quinly,18/06/2021,Walmart,"I went to the Wal-Mart at 4021 Lagniappe Way in Tallahassee, FL. First on a Friday afternoon they had only 3 cashiers available plus self serve which had a ridiculous long line. I waited for a cashier who didn't understand that they have a sheet with products in the Garden Center at each cashier station (or they should have one at each cashier) I told her that I needed 12 bags of pine bark mulch and the cost is $1.97 per bag. I found a sheet at another station and was told that she could not discount the pine bark mulch for the displayed price and to go stand in the Customer Service line instead of calling for assistance. The Customer Service line was beyond long so I went and took pictures of the scan bar and price and went back to the cashier where I had originally stood in line. She told me again that she could not help me and to go to Customer Service and by this time the line was more manageable. I was able to but the pine bark mulch. Unfortunately I had to load the 12 bags of mulch by myself since there were not employees to be found near the drive trough mulch.  Once I was in my car I called the store to speak to the manager to complain about my experience. It took approximately 3 minutes for someone to pick up and she put me on hold and after for holding for another 26 minutes waiting to speak to the manager I was hung up on. I'm afraid that the lack of customer service starts at the top with management and goes all the way to the cashiers on the front lines. If the pine bark mulch was the same price at the other Wal-Marts stores I would avoid this location like the plague."
3098,43014,K. Williams,18/06/2021,Walmart,Purchased a 70â€ T.V. from Walmart in Hampton VA. Once we arrived home and unboxed the T.V. we realized the TV wasnâ€™t the one we purchased and the screen was damaged. We took it back to Walmart and they refused to offer any sort of resolution. The store associate Cora was very disrespectful and the Managers acted as if we were trying to get over. We believe another customer purchased the TV and placed their broken TV back in the box and returned it for a refund. The customer service rep probably didnâ€™t check it as they should and refunded it. Placed it back on the sales floor. Now we are out of $559.63 and have a useless broken T.V. Highly upset that a person would do that. Money is hard to come by and to be cheated out of it is saddening.
3099,43015,Dennis Sage,18/06/2021,Walmart,"In all of the Harrisburg Pennsylvania area stores, there are Never Enough wheelchairs. There are either no chairs available or the ones that could be available have dead batteries. Same goes for handicap parking spaces. Can't tell you how often I see teenagers driving apparently Grandma's car pull into a wheelchair spot go giggling into the store."
3100,43016,Ann Mills,18/06/2021,Walmart,"Went to the Maplewood, Mo Walmart which is normally a decent store. It was an hour before closing. Not 1 shopping cart available at the entrance. The only riding cart available was inoperable. Looked for the Walmart brand 12 Grain & Seed Bread, none found. Went to the canning supplies isle and found mostly empty shelves. A few jars, a few lids but not the 2 piece lids I was looking for. There were no tools either. Quite disappointing."
3101,43017,Sheila Buadu,18/06/2021,Walmart,"Bought a Shark Rocket vacuum cleaner 6/4/21. Took it home unpacked it. Decided to use it 6/14/21, while adding cleaner I noticed the filter was dirty (on this new vacuum cleaner (how???). I looked at the brushes and they were dirty (mind you I am the only person in the household). I immediately took the vacuum back to Walmart and explained everything to Customer Service. Customer Service stated they could not accept return without being in original packaging. I only wanted even exchange, not refund. I paid for a new machine not a used one. I asked to speak to the manager, Ratesha, she immediately re-stated with a blank face they will not accept the return without original packaging. I was very disappointed being that I live in the area and frequently shopped at this Walmart #5927 Lingbergh Florissant. What really puzzles me is what is going on at this Walmart how can a concealed packaged item be used. I will no longer frequent this Walmart and advise everyone that does to check your purchases before discarding the packaging. The manager, Ratesha, was very uncaring in attitude and body language. Had I wanted a used product I would have gone to a thrift store. No longer a Walmart customer."

3103,40542,Bdwkrl SHU,18/06/2022,Walmart,"A delivery guy was very rude. He phoned several times and demanded that I picked up grocery from his car at the street because he would not drive through townhouse property. I told that the instruction was ""live at the door"". He screamed on the phone and threatened that he will live groceries at the street. I have a mobility problem, so I am not able to carry heavy items. He was very mad and creamed loudly. Finally, groceries were thrown on the dirty ground and scattered on the doorway. He damaged coffee cream and a jug of olives was opened and it leaked. Absolutely unacceptable to treat customers this way."
3104,40543,GamerMom,18/06/2022,Walmart,"This is in regards to order that should have been delivered today, June 18th between 12-1pm. I am absolutely furious! My daughter watched the delivery driver go to my next door neighbors house, speak with the neighbor, pick the groceries off of the neighbors porch, reload them back into the trunk of her car and speed away. We then get a zoomed up image of the grocery bags showing my name but conveniently not showing any background so you could see where the groceries were left and a note asking me to tip the driver because the groceries were delivered. I IMMEDIATELY got on a chat with Walmart. For 40 minutes, we went back and forth before he said he would have someone call me. I donâ€™t trust anyone to call (because Walmart proves themselves untrustworthy) so I asked for a phone number where I could call someone. He gave me 2 wrong numbers. I found the right number on the internet called it where after waiting for an eternity the call was picked up, then hung up without anyone saying a word. Not once, twice! Then I get a call for my local Walmart. The gentleman says word for word, â€œHeyâ€¦ummmmâ€¦you were supposed to have a grocery delivery done today but the driver said that YOU gave them an address that doesnâ€™t exist so she brought your groceries back to the storeâ€. Iâ€™m sorry, what!? I order from Walmart 1-2 times a week. I donâ€™t randomly change my address with each individual order, I know where I live and what my address is so it was a bunch of BS. I tell him that I am recovering from surgery and canâ€™t come to pick up my groceries. He says, â€˜I guess I can put in a delivery order for a couple of hours from now but you did give the wrong addressâ€. Right, so we are now double downing on the ridiculous. The driver apparently has an issue telling the truth, the person that called me apparently has an issue with using his common sense. I finally get a call from a Walmart customer service and he â€œrefundsâ€ my money (never telling me that it could take up to 10 days for me to get it) and places the order again for 7-8pm. And surprise, surprise now some items are out of stock. Never mind the fact that they are literally paid for, packed and purchased sitting at Walmart. I donâ€™t get any offers of compensation. I literally have to ask. I get a whopping $10 off coupon. That isnâ€™t even the $12.50 I spend monthly as a Walmart + member! Walmart makes their customers feel like they donâ€™t value them. This kind of craziness happens on a constant basis. I have had my entire order cancelled and never once been notified. Today was just the icing on the cake, implying that I am somehow at fault because I supposedly donâ€™t know my address when it was an incompetent driver. I do not get my groceries delivered because Iâ€™m too lazy to go to the store, I get them delivered because I unfortunately have no other choice! I am disabled and canâ€™t go get groceries, I would love to but physically canâ€™t! I used to use SHIPT and Instacart but they were very expensive. I also used Amazon Fresh but they donâ€™t have a large selection and they also are expensive. I went to Walmart because I thought I would be getting lower prices and quality delivery. Walmart is even jacking their prices up. At least with any of the other three grocery delivery services, I actually got my groceries."

3107,47173,Nike Lover,19/06/2017,Walmart,"There's not many things I hate, but Walmart is definitely one of them. Walmarts are always messy, and unorganized. The employees don't want to help you, and they act like they are not getting paid to help people. Customer service is rude, and nonchalant! The registers are always majority closed, which is said. I have not stepped foot in a Walmart in a long time, but from what I hear it is the same. Do yourself a favor, and do not go to Walmart, give your money to a store who appreciates you."
3108,44995,Wendy C.,19/06/2020,Walmart,Website could be a little broader when looking for items. You have to change wording to get same results several times but other than that I had no problems and shipping was very fast. I have used it several times and will continue
3109,44996,Achraf Toufella,19/06/2020,Walmart,this is very good website i did enjoy working with you cs services answer are so professionally they answer on the chat 24/24 returns are guranteed and fast shipping everything here is amazing i do really recommend this websites

3111,44998,Jean Ruthruff,19/06/2020,Walmart,I am 62 years old and that is a very hard age to lose weight. I did some reading on this product and decided to check it out I've been using it for about 3 months now and that is really help me control my eating and also helps me lose weight. And I get no side effects from it whatsoever. And I do believe I have more energy.
3112,44999,Jennifer Gajan,19/06/2020,Walmart,I enjoy shopping walmart.com.. i can usually find what I'm looking for that's not always in stock or they just don't have it in the actual Walmart .stores
3113,45000,Clarisse RaqueÃ±o,19/06/2020,Walmart,Walmart has affordable products. I ordered few items here before and got the exact products that I wanted. Will order again next time!
3114,45001,Sue Meals,19/06/2020,Walmart,"Customer resolution get above and beyond! I purchased 119.95 shoes through there market place and was unable to return during covid-19 and when they did accept returns the market place (shoes.com) refused to take back because of time limit. The resolution department just refunded my money and told me to donate the 119.95 shoes to someone in need. Wow Walmart, your great. Thanks and they will be donated to the salvation army."
3115,36404,Kasey D.,19/06/2018,Amazon Go,"The introvert in me LOVES this! Just walk in, take what you want, leave! No interaction. It's great. It's so spooky how it links to your account so quickly. If you look up you can see all the sensors and cameras. It's crazy. I was so blown away I forgot to take pictures. I will have to go back. They have ""Amazon Go"" mugs and water bottles. They also have free reusable bags for a limited time. If you're in the area or on vacation make this a stop!"
3116,36208,Joe D.,19/06/2020,Amazon Go,"Woohoo!  Welcome to the 21st century corner market.  This fully automated Amazon grocery is the best thing since sliced bread IMHO, and further cements my tendency to make Jeff Bezos even richer.  On a quick business trip to Seattle, I tried out one of these fully automated Amazon stores (the flight during CV19 was a trip, so to speak).  I'd read about this new concept, testing since about 2018 and now opening up all over (Seattle, Chicago, New York, SF, Philly, NJ).  Amazon is now the owner of Whole Foods (can integration of this tech be far off there?)  They're also experimenting with buying and converting standard grocery stores to this methodology.  The basic idea is you load an app on your phone which clocks you into a little gate at the front of the store.   Everything is fully automated on your Amazon account and there's no need to check out or even self-scan.  A couple of cities have passed ordinances that you must have a cash option, so a few of these stores also have a human checkout for Luddites, but most don't take cash or have any form human attendant.  Wow: clean, fast, good prices and never a chance of a surly check-out dude.  When will this concept come to Miami?"
3117,43007,Marty,19/06/2021,Walmart,"This is one of the worst experiences I have ever had. I made an appointment at the tire portion of the store, they couldn't find my appointment and asked what I needed They kept asking and asking me if I was sure I made the appointment, must have been at least ten times. I finally said forget about the appointment do you have time to perform the service. She said yes went out to the vehicle and another clerk came over and started asking the same questions, by that time I was so DISGUSETED I just told him to go away. Treating customers like they are dumb instead of just fixing their mistakes"
3118,43008,customer in Atlanta Ga,19/06/2021,Walmart,"I placed an order with Walmart. They used FedEx for the delivery on May 17. Upon leaving my driveway, the FedEx driver ran over a decorative landscaping raised bed damaging the low block wall and bed. I call Walmart. They said to call FedEx. I call FedEx. They said they would turn it over to the local FedEx. The local FedEx turned it over to their claims contractor, ARC. ARC asked for additional info. I sent it twice. They claimed they could not read it or open it. I sent it again in two different formats and asked for them to confirm that they have it. No response. I have sent over 15 emails to ARC. It has now been over a month. No response. From now on, no Walmart; no FedEx; no worries. I guess I am stuck with Amazon."
3119,43009,Rose D,19/06/2021,Walmart,"Received email at 3:38pm that FedEx delivered at 11:55am. Looked on my porch, no package. Called customer service and told I had to wait 48 hrs. to initiate a refund. What? Called 2 days later; oh wait, you have to call back at 8:00pm. What? Never again will I shop Walmart. Iâ€™ll pay the extra money for Amazon Prime and their exceptional customer service."
3120,43010,Nic Donga,19/06/2021,Walmart,Poor customer service. Tried investing in crypto? Give a try to wellinvested.org . They are legit and genuine site with an incredible policy for payments. Iâ€™m getting much profit here
3121,40534,Regina Cromwell,19/06/2022,Walmart,Walmart online ordering is the worst ever!!!!! Took my money with no pick !! No merchandise!!!!Bad customer service
3122,40535,John,19/06/2022,Walmart,"I decided to try an order for delivery. They charged an automatic $7 tip for a $10.99 order. This was on top of a $13.98 delivery charge. No thank you. I used to be a dedicated Walmart customer. I will still get a few items from them, but they will no longer be my first choice. In fact, I just spent $450 on groceries and the new upscale Walmart got zero dollars from me."
3123,40536,James,19/06/2022,Walmart,"Worst grocery service ever. Delayed, cancelled and then doesn't show up"
3124,40537,Marilyn York Reames,19/06/2022,Walmart,"Purchased several items. 2 WRONG products delivered to me. Called CS within 5 minutes of receiving the WRONG product. Told them I wanted a refund and to send a RSL right away. This was June 4. Shipped the items BACK via Fed Ex on June 13th and they are showing they will arrive on June 20. The message from Walmart is that it will then take ANOTHER 3 WEEKS to issue a refund to me! I will NEVER, EVER, EVER purchase another item from this company. It is sickening that they screwed up the order and then punish the buyer by withholding THEIR money. Repeated phone calls are met with call centers and people who read from scripts. UTTERLY HORRIFIC ""Customer Service""."
3125,40538,Crystal Jeroneika,19/06/2022,Walmart,Walmart have became the worst place to shop at. And they show that they don't care about they customer at all just our money. I place an order to be delivered for today and now it's 12 and no update about my order or anything and when I call customer service and all they can say is it's delayed until tomorrow..
3126,40539,RareVinyl Vault,19/06/2022,Walmart,"Two can play this game. As a result of this stupid woke conglomerate's decision to egregiously remove Mike Lindell's product line of My pillows from their stores, I've punched back by closing my online account I used to buy and have things shipped to me. I have followed up with selecting Meijer's as my new place to buy my goods forever removing Walmart from our place to shop. THIS is how to slap the crap out of these sanctimonious morons when they walk all over us and our country with absolute impunity. You have power over these people and places. USE IT as I have. Thank you."
3127,40540,Kyle Robinson,19/06/2022,Walmart,Sent me the wrong tools I ordered twice. So I had to go up there to the store and exchange it both times. So that just cost more money going back up there plus there's not enough hours in the day the way it is just want my packages to be right
3128,40541,John Simonson,19/06/2022,Walmart,"I went to my local Walmart in Florida and they said that My Pillow is no longer being sold due to the ""owner and his political stance."" I find it absolutely appalling that Walmart has taken a great American made product away from its consumers but will happily distribute garbage products made in communist China all day long. Walmart now becoming ""woke"" and political is a terrible financial move and even the mighty can fall. Beware of who your consumer base is Walton family and please don't try and play the blame game on the products made up fake reviews online. Never again will I shop in a Walmart due to this reckless political hatchet job."
3129,44992,Nandi,20/06/2020,Walmart,"I was a relatively new hard working Walmart associate. I found out about their biased/poor treatment of employees but was focused on doing my job well. When the pandemic hit, I decided to take the leave that was offered. I am black, over 55, have underlying health conditions, live in a ""hot spot"" and learned that a coworker had contracted the virus. I was not willing to take a chance with my life or those that I love... my grandchildren and elderly mother whom I care for on occasion. I extended my leave until June 15, when the governor lifted the stay at home order. Upon my return to work I phoned in to check my work schedule and was informed that I had been terminated weeks ago. It was obvious that the manager was mad when I told her I had extended my leave to June 15, by her sharp tone and the slamming of the phone receiver before I was even finished. No notice, no reason given, fired during the pandemic. Walmart uses unfair, biased and predjudiced practices in the treatment of their employees. Shame on this mega retail store for allowing these practices to take place over and over again."
3130,44993,My Lawyers,20/06/2020,Walmart,"I love Wal-mart but they're starting to suck. I purchase some clothes and went to try them on the lady said you can't try them on. I said okay, she told me if they didn't fit I could bring the back for an exchange. I also asked a manager too. I took some of them back the same day and they said we're not doing returns. Of course I was pissed off I told her how can some say you can return and now you tell me I can't. She call the manager and that heffa said the same thing, but I said I'm confuse you was one of them that said I could bring them back. OH NOW you want to look STUPID and I said yes you told me a couple about 2 hours ago. Now I'm stuck with clothes until or maybe for months that I can't use on my vacation now. I will be shopping for clothes at Target before I clothes shop here again. WAL-MART SUCKS."
3131,44994,Lynn Goodman,20/06/2020,Walmart,Douglas walmart! That's in Ga. 1. They discriminating against old people. Their rope area twice longer than others! Then they have no electric carts for use??? 2. You take back item with receipt and to be told dont take back that item??? So called another store had NO PROBLEM????? The people there are not friendly!
3132,43002,Jay Sowden,20/06/2021,Walmart,Associated with text scammers like you are doing shows the type of greed that Walmart really has. Bullahitsurveys & lies about receiving prizes and over charging. Only to try stealing from good people. You need to stop.
3133,43003,JUDITH NIEVES,20/06/2021,Walmart,"I bought on walmart.com an umbrella stand but it did no hold my 9' ft umbrella. I took the stand to my closest Walmart store to return it, but the service representative there told me that I had to put it in a box to return it (it was shipped to me from Walmart in a plastic bag). And to ask around to Walmart employers for any box that I can fit the scan in, so I didn't have to pay for one. I got an empty fruit box, and went back to the service area. A supervisor said that the box wasn't suitable to return it because it had holes in it. I was returning a big plastic umbrella stand that was already in a plastic bag. After all that hassle just to return an item, I decided to keep it and donate it. I lost $30.00 because of the worst return policy I have ever seen."
3134,43004,Linda Jacobs,20/06/2021,Walmart,went to the harrison ar walmart this morning went to check out a young man was running the cash register a lady in front of us spoke to him he never said a word she waited and she said are you mad or something not a word. so she left it and went on. i went to the register he never spoke never said a word put one item no matter how big or how small in a bag an that was it . no customer to it at all he sure needs to find another job . if he had worked for me he would have been fired right there. he didnt want to be there and he wanted everyone to know that.
3135,43005,Timberly Davis,20/06/2021,Walmart,"Saw a product online in a store by our home for $20.88. Went to the store the same item rang up for $48.88. Spoke with Mgr, he informed me they don't price match and online prices are different. He had no authority to override the price. I informed him this wasn't a good customer experience. I went home and ordered the same item for curbside pickup. Walmart is a very low-end store and I expected better but had to remember who I was dealing with."

3137,40529,Adeline Schooley,20/06/2022,Walmart,"Do you think with all the money walmart makes they can splurge a little bit. Just bought the strawberry cream cheese croissants. Hardly any filling inside, they were so dry they were almost dust. And $2 to answer a question for me......no thanks. Wont be shopping to much at walmart anymore."
3138,40530,msbav8r,20/06/2022,Walmart,"Made a purchase from Walmart.com and used Affirm as payment method. I ended up retrurning the item, as it was listed as 'refurbished', but was used, dirty, and unusable. I requested a return, was given a shipping label, returned the item, Walmart confirmed they receved the return. Yet, Affirm has started to debit my bank account for monthly payments. Both Walmart and Affirm are fetid cesspools of incompetence. Going to have to sue both of them."
3139,40531,Randall Gardner,20/06/2022,Walmart,"I have been trying for 30 minutes to get somebody on the phone, but no luck. After that I tried every extension on the phone list, still no luck. No wonder they have only a one star rating!"
3140,40532,Michael Webb,20/06/2022,Walmart,"Walmart owned by the Waltons. The people who by life insurance policies on their workers, so when one of them dies, they get millions and the families get nothing. Did you see the World Economic Forum? According to them, they own the world, and they want you microchipped, so they can control you! These people are Nazi's who are in bed with China. Stop spending your money here."
3141,40533,Robert Sanchez,20/06/2022,Walmart,When your tired and have a basket full of groceries dont go to walmart. They wont open the conveyor self check stating not enough people to watch the area. I go to Costco or heb . Walmart mangers holding back on labor hours. Hurting there stores and walmart overall. Unacceptable in San Antonio tx
3142,40552,Ken,20/06/2022,Walmart,"I placed 3 orders in the last two weeks one never showed up and it's been 10 days, one was delivered to the wrong house. one i received two days late. You order online, they deliver part of your order from the store and you never get the order. When you call they say there is nothing they can do? They said I ordered groceries, I ordered a bottle of flea medication for the dog and a coffee maker? So after 20 minutes of arguing they agree to refund my money in 10 to 15 days? I ordered because we needed it now! Update 06/20/2022 the order I placed on the 5th of May 2022 still has not been delivered Walmart customer support is no help."
3143,47091,RUSTY CHAMBERS,21/06/2018,Walmart,I have been a Walmart fan since the first time I walked into one in Yuba City CA. Unfortunately the friendlyness and professionalism of their staff has been declining over the years. Now itâ€™s hard to find an employee that is friendly and willing to help me. I have been in retail for a long time and I believe that a lot of BUT not all of of employees behavior towards customers is a reflection of their working environment. Itâ€™s sad too see but even managment has been rude and unprofessional lately.
3144,47092,Linda Rogers,21/06/2018,Walmart,We placed an order for about $50 worth of items. Unfortunately the package came all torn up the bottles with liquid and boxes of the actual products were smashed dented and very bad shape. If this is how they're going to send their product to a customer brand new?! No thank you! I'd rather buy from the dollar store. Very disappointed and will not shop here or order anything else to be shipped to my house because they trashed my order.

3146,44985,Tam Nix,21/06/2020,Walmart,Want to buy a money order at Walmart... here's why you shouldn't. If you buy it and want to cash it in that same day you can't. So if you pay someone with it and they go to cash it in they can't. It has to be cashed at the same Walmart and because their system and MoneyGram don't communicate that money order is a piece of paper Do not waste your money go to QT or the post office instead. Money transactions are still done Walmart. Bad business.
3147,44986,Lori Leonard,21/06/2020,Walmart,I USE TO LOVE SHOPPING AT WALMART BUT I PLACED AN ORDER AND WAS TO GET IT JUNE 10 AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT..

3148,44987,Manda,21/06/2020,Walmart,The shipping relatively quick. I get some items very quickly and others take a little longer. Only once did my items not get delivered but they were quick to send replacements or a refund.
3149,44988,Novie Grampon,21/06/2020,Walmart,"Their products are affordable and very sturdy! I really love their products because it is very cheap than any other stores. Though during this pandemic my package takes so long to arrive it is just okay because of this pandemic, I understand."

3152,44991,Jennifer Rooks,21/06/2020,Walmart,"I have been a shopper and a employee work Walmart both where bad. I have come across so many employees that have been rude when you ask them something,or act like they didn't hear you. I have ordered things and had it shipped to the store and it never make it. The worse experience I've had was a Christmas lay way for my kids that they lost and couldn't replace cause they where out on the shelf. Working there I have seen employees stick their hands in the food at the deli and get them some to eat while on the clock note not washing their hands or putting on gloves."
3153,45099,Keeper,21/06/2020,Walmart,"The third party seller was still messing around with my return request and offering no resolution to the issue. I finally gave up trying to get my money back from them and opened the journal package. As soon as I opened the journal the spine separated from the pages making the journal useless. I have asked for a full refund on the journal which included a shipping charge since it's defective so we'll see how they respond to my request for a refund. I don't have high hopes that they will do the right thing though.  Never shop Walmart online. They use third party sellers and if you don't like the product(s) they offer NO SUPPORT. I have a Better Business and Consumer complaint filed against them for failing to support me as a customer. I ordered a couple items that were no where near what was described and took a lot longer to arrive so wanted to return them. The third party seller was pretty much useless and honestly very insulting. They refused to allow me return and offered a whopping $2 refund instead (after charging me $5 to get the items shipped). When I reached out to Walmart all they said was deal with the third party seller, nice huh? Save your money and frustration level and shop with companies that protect their customers."

3156,42998,Upset Customer,21/06/2021,Walmart,"They deprived me of over $100 from my point of view. Too ridiculous of a situation to be worth the typing. All I know is I won't be going back (to Walmart, which sounds strange)"
3157,42999,Consumer,21/06/2021,Walmart,This is a Company that doesnâ€™t give a damn about their Customers! I purchased a Outside Shed from them 656.00. They told me it would be at my house by June 18th. I took off work paid men to help me install it but it never showed up! They tried to give me some junk that it was delivered on Wednesday but I was home that day and nothing! I finally got a message from the actual distribution center stating that it was damaged and couldnâ€™t be sold! Walmart had the same shed on their website for more money and asked me to pay the extra to get the same shed different distributor! That Bad Business! Donâ€™t waste your money on Companies that donâ€™t back the merchandise that their Selling
3158,43000,Snedden Ferreira,21/06/2021,Walmart,"Totally dishonest policy to serve Canadian customers online. I have been waiting for over a month for a refund and each customer service agent tells me that it has been processed, only to be again told that it has not yet been initiated.

3160,40524,Rodney,21/06/2022,Walmart,"Bought a Walmart Gift Card that doesn't work. I am over a week trying to get a solution from Walmart and all I get is the runaround. I called 1-888-537-5503 and the genius there told me to call 1-888-537-5503. I have called 6 times, sent various emails and no one cares and I am losing my patience over this and of course there are no managers that you can call. I was told 5 days ago that this was escalated, in my world that means someone is going to reach out to you and rectify the situation, not according to Walmart it seems. Horrible experience that gets worse and worse"
3161,40525,D LANIER,21/06/2022,Walmart,"I made one order of 11 items to be delivered that same day. Instead I have so far had 6 deliveries. 1 jar of jelly, 1 jar of jelly, 1 jar of aspirin, 2 things of Oreos, 1 small stool and 1 hp printer ink. 6 deliveries. If I was out of townâ€¦. I live in Phoenix. Everything would be ruined. Please stop the random arbitrary shipping. I hate it!!"
3162,40526,Kim Mathis,21/06/2022,Walmart,"I ordered from walmart.com on June 15th, went to pick up my order which wasn't complete. Online stated my item was available, it wasn't. They were unable to tell me when I would recieve my ""pending transaction"" back to my card. I was told the ""system"" is searching to see if it's at another store then they would ship it. If I wanted it shipped I would have done that in the first place. Seven days later the transaction has disappeared from my credit card without ""releasing"" the hold. Weird how it isn't on my card where I can see it. I recieved an ""we are sorry"" email and hope we ""get it right next time"". There will not be a next time. The worst service ever, plus they are holding credit on my card knowing that they have canceled the order. Days before they will release the hold."
3163,40527,Grace Woodward,21/06/2022,Walmart,"The delivery services that Walmart uses are horrible. I order food for my 92 year old mother who lives in a senior apartment. Recently an order was delivered but there were many items missing. We were charged for the items. I spent a lot of time on the phone with customer service reviewing the items that weren't received but we were charged. The driver either misdelivered some of our order or decided to keep some of the items for himself. Where's the check & balance? Today's order was delivered to the wrong apartment. My mom had a honest neighbor who brought my mom's order to her. Also, there were special instructions for my mom to sign for the order. BEWARE of using Walmart!! They use Uber, Door Dash, & one other service that I didn't write down while complaining to Customer Service. We'll spend our $$ some place else. Walmart - Are you listening???"
3164,40528,alan lau,21/06/2022,Walmart,"Walmart online is awful, their customer service can do nothing for their customers. I'm returning a bike bought from Walmart.com and the tire was delivered flat as in won't inflate with air, this is Walmart quality. I'm trying to return it and I've been waiting a entire day for a fed ex to pick up this piece of junk Walmart bike and they didn't come to pick it up. Bear in mind I called Walmart to confirm today's delivery and the customer service says yes someone will pick it up today and it's 6pm and no one came to pick up the bike. I called walmart again and the customer service says tomorrow and theirs nothing that can be done about it. Walmart customer service is horrible, Walmart quality is horrible too. Don't buy anything from Walmart buy amazon."

3166,44983,Darlene Fischer,22/06/2020,Walmart,TMZ posted a video on twitter.... As I watched this video of one of your employees trying to enforce the wearing of a mask.I found that maybe you should treat your employees the way one of yours was treating that old man in the video. One employee doesn't even have a mask on and others not wearing them properly.

3169,42994,linda winchester,22/06/2021,Walmart,"I'm new to using the on line Walart website. Looking at all the canned goods, it skulk help me if canned product descriptions included ""Pop Top."" Examining the product photos, it doesn't show the top of the can well enough to show that & it is not mentioned in the description. I avoided buying canned veggies $ canned beans. Some of us don't own a cam opener anymore. I wanted to buy a csn of beans to make some heavy duty navajos but I didn't want to gst stuck with a can I can't open. I wanted to buy canned corn & French Cut green beans but it doesn't do me any good when I receive my order & discover I need a can opener. Perhaps I don't want to buy a $5+ manual owner just to open a 59 cent can of Great Value corn & have to buy a tool to get it open. We've had food drives for the needy & a homeless person might have enough to buy an inexpensive canned good but certainly not a nanusl can opener too. & certainly the needy wouldn't have an electric can opener + selectivity. Vienna sausages are popular because they're a meat product that doesn't require refrigeration & these ALWAYS have pop tops. Not everyone is like us. Walmart is complimented for low prices, especially important to low income & homeless folks But those folks can't take advantage of something they desperately need: tenedy their hunger with the small amount of $ they have. Some will donate canned goods that don't have the easy open pop tops. If the recipients don't have access to a can opener, those products are set aside at the end of the day.to be donated to a homeless shelter/charity that prepare meals for the homeless that agrees they can use them. Thanks for reading my perspective on this minor but impactful situation.Respectfully, Linda Winchester"
3170,42995,Crescent Moon,22/06/2021,Walmart,"It has been a few days, and I decide that I needed to do this. So I was in a rush, and I went to customer service for help. However, all the spots were taken so I waited for my turn. I waited for a really long time. I heard employee one telling the customer that they were done, but then employee two whisper to employee one, and they both looked at me. Employee one continued to talk to the same customer even though she said they were done and kept on asking him to sign things. When employee two walk back to her space. She service two people who came after me. I was in a rush like really bad. When the two people left, I walked up to employee two. Employee two told me that she was not open. I literally wanted to scream at her. I saw her talk to the people earlier and offer her help, but she refused to help me. The worst part about it was that she kept staring at me the whole time I was waiting for my turn so she definitely saw that I was waiting for a long time. I don't know if she was being lazy or if it was because I am a asian."
3171,40520,Sergey Yasevich,22/06/2022,Walmart,"Casual story - bought an item in the store, paid with my cell phone Walmart Pay came home and realized does not need it. Already have it. Came up to the store and on the way used same App to start a refund - refund started. But no email, or message back. Customer service cannot refund because it is started online and askes for email that never came. Walmart agent online does not process refunds to items bough in store. Luckily the purchase was for 2.74 and after quite a long chat the Agent gave me a refund (as an exception) Thank you Walmart. Lesson learned DO NOT START RETURN WITH THE APP. LET CUSTOMER SERVICE DO ALL THE WORK."

3173,40522,Paul,22/06/2022,Walmart,"I gave them 80% because of the stores that I've gone to, and some of those stores I still do business with, is because Walmart has the best prices overall! Walmart has its own Pharmacy and Vision Center. It also has just about everything you'd need or want for your home, apartment, or business. Pets too! I almost forgot to mention the auto and garden sections! The cold and frozen food sections, have good quality products as well! It's where I do most of my shopping! Name it, and you can probably find it there, including electronics and clothes."

Recently I had an issue with my online account being compromised and later found out that there were more people with the exact same issue. It took numerous phone calls to get them to completely delete my account online. Other than that, I have been pretty happy with my purchases, shipping, and the site as a whole. I love that most products have reviews, that's the main thing I look for when making a purchase."
3176,47287,Pam Beamon,23/06/2016,Walmart,"I use Walmart stores because they have everything I need from food to footwear. I think that the employees could be taught better customer skills.

For such a large, successful business, I really feel like they need to be either choosier in their employee selection or teach their employees to better serve their customers."

Since the fitting rooms are closed because of the viral pandemic, I couldn't try it on at the store, so I just bought the shirt to try at home, thinking I could return the item easily. The shirt didn't fit well at all, so I tried to return it the next couple of days, but the associate tending the custoner service counter said they are not accepting returns indefinitely. Walmart should have made an advisory about this no return policy while fitting rooms are not usable, so buyers won't be tricked into buying an apparel they could not return if it won't fit."

The told me they are inspecting where is the package now 9 times and for many months every week, they told me to contact next week. When I said to an agent that I want to talk to the supervisor she put me on hold for 2 hours and somebody cut up the phone. I get out of this terrible company, NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM. That was my LAST SHOPPING FROM WALMART"

3187,42988,Gail Miller,23/06/2021,Walmart,"I don't know what is happening to this Wal Mart. Very poor management. The store is always low on stock. One time I went in there for a tooth brush, and they were out.. The shelves are always empty. The are unsupervised teenagers in the sporting good dept. playing basket ball, and knocking things down. I almost got hit by a ball, and all the kids did was laugh. It's messy, dirty, and understocked. They always have people attacking you to buy cable or something. This store has to be evaluated. It's terrible. I will not shop there anymore until they get their ack together. Gail"

3191,46735,Tonya,24/06/2019,Walmart,"I ordered a knee brace. It was supposedly delivered Friday. I was home all day & it was not delivered to my address. I've called fed x & got a claim #. I waited 48 hours & called walmart.com. lt literally took me 2 hours to find the phone number. I was told I had to deal with another company. Apparently I had ordered from a 3rd party. I'm extremely frustrated at this point. I had to talk to the 3rd part vendor, I was told it was delivered. At this point I lose my cool. I know it said it was delivered. It's not at my house & I'm tired of getting the run around. I may or may not get this $60 knee brace or my money back. I do know this, I WILL NEVER ORDER from WAL-MART.COM again! Update a week later the 3 Rd party sent a new brace but Walmart never called back to make sure everything was taken care of. Customer service is a thing of the past when it involves Walmart."

Was given a walmart.com customer service number. Told her my problem and how aggravated I was. She said they'd refund me in 5 business days!! Would not deliver the missing food. NEVER apologized. Told me no supervisor available and had done the max amount for me and hung up. HEB would NEVER do this to their customer. I will NEVER order from walmart again. BEWARE!!
3194,44974,Fatima Gako,24/06/2020,Walmart,Not only that they offer a lot of items for you but they also have the greatest customer service. Most of the employees Ive met is very accomodating. Great Job and Keep it up.
3195,44975,K Dent,24/06/2020,Walmart,"I bought an inflatable paddleboard in February from a third party seller on Walmart.com. Since it's cold in February and the beaches closed in March and April due to the global pandemic, we did not use the paddleboard until recently. The first time we tried it out in our pool and it worked great. The directions on releasing the air were very unclear but we thought we did it correctly. The second time we tried using it was at the beach last weekend. The valve appeared to be broken and the paddleboard would not maintain the correct PSI of air. I contacted the seller who informed me that it was made out of the country, the warranty had expired, and there was nothing they could do to help me. I contacted Walmart .com's customer service and asked if they stood behind the products sold through third party sellers and was there nothing they could do for me? The rep was sooo friendly and helpful. He assured me that they could help me and put me on hold. After being on hold for about 8 minutes, the rep came back and told me that they were issuing a full refund! THANK YOU, Walmart, for supporting your customers!!!"
3196,44976,ConiMans,24/06/2020,Walmart,"I had to use a delivery service for my groceries due to my health and the pandemic so I chose Wal-Mart as I know what they have at their stores. I created my cart, the delivery fee was attached and I placed my order. It was to arrive between 6-7pm and they stated that I would be notified when it arrived. I was very happy, until 6-7pm came and passed. Iwent to the front of my building, no one was there, no groceries so I called the help on the site of my Wal-Mart confirmation email. The lady told me that my order had been cancelled because something went wrong on their end and she said they sent me an email stating that. I returned to my email account, while with her on the phone, and...No...there was only my confirmation email. I asked why would they Not call me, text me or send that email...once again, she said they sent me an email and Once Again I told her No.. They Didn't. She apologized and asked if she could help me re-order my groceries.. You know, they Failed Miserably... so No...I will take my business else where...probably to Target and Food Lion."

I went back with a box and was told this time it was a marketplace item and I must contact to seller for a return label. Never, ever buy on line from Walmart. Not worth the hassle. Amazon and Target make returns easy."

3203,47088,Carol Evans Younce,25/06/2018,Walmart,"I just hate this store. Almost all of their product is imported from China, and there have been issues with lead in their little jelly shoes for little girls and purses and toys that I have READ ABOUT on FB. You can walk a mile and still have to wait 20 minutes in the only checkout line. Walmart is on the bottom of the barrel as far as customer service, speed of checkout, pricing, quality and ethics. On the plus side, my friends young son just got a job as a stock boy there for $11 an hour and he likes it a great deal."
3204,46715,Chris Lewis,25/06/2019,Walmart,Dont do it! I waited 2 weeks for a tv I bought on a good sale to get here. Excited to open it up and the screen is broken. Someone had already been in the box for this tv as all of the plastic protective film had already been removed from the frame and back of the TV. Call Walmart and the girl tells me she will send me a replacement 4 series for the same price. I literally laughed at her. Yeah. I want the base model as a direct replacement for one of the highest rated tv's from last year? She says wait a minute I found a replacement but i would NEED TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL $550 for her to ship it to me. At that point I lost it and flipped out on her. You ship me a broken TV that someone had obviously already returned for being broken. Then you tell try to replace it with a crap model or pay $550 more???? What is that junk? I spoke with a supervisor after her who is going to make it right with a direct replacement. But what a nightmare. Dont put yourself through it. Buy your TV's from a store where easy return is possible.
3205,46716,Tempie Lea Vickery,25/06/2019,Walmart,"My first time ordering in store pick up. My daughter was issued a gift card from her new employer to buy boots needed for the job. I ordered online to pick up in the store to save time. I then received a notice that the item was not available until Thursday. I cancelled the order, which will take them 48hrs to refund the gift card, so we can not go purchase the boots that we found ON THE SHELF, with the gift card that was provided by the employer. I am out the money. Hopefully their refund process is better than their online pickup experience."
3206,46717,Marry C Ako,25/06/2019,Walmart,"I had a bad experience with this company, I ordered furnitures online and the first set of items were delivered to the leasing office and not directly to our unit.I called the walmart call center and complained about the incident and requested to send the items directly to our unit as its all huge and heavy furnitures and the agent promised the next set of items will be delivered directly to our unit.But it did not happen, again they delivered the sofa,beds and tv holder to the leasing office which is quite far from my unit. I CALLED THEIR CALL CENTER AGAIN AND COMPLAINED ABOUT THE SITUATION AND THE AGENT TOLD ME THAT ONLY HANDICAPPED PEOPLE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO GET THEIR ITEMS DIRECTLY SENT TO THEIR DOORSTEP, AND I ASKED HIM SO I NEED TO BE DISABLED FIRST BEFORE I CAN GET YOU DELIVERD MY ITEMS DIRECTLY TO MY UNIT AND THE GUY SAID""BASICALLY YES MA'AM!!!!AS IN WOW !!!WHAT A GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"
3207,46718,Len Stillman,25/06/2019,Walmart,"I ordered a TV and that took about 10 days for processing and eventual delivery which was first problem.  When the TV came the screen was smashed. I called and got instant material to send the device back for a replacement.  Here is the point that caused me to give their CS one star. I asked when re-delivery would be to replace the damaged TV. I was told would take 2 DAYS TO REORDER A DEVICE. So, rather than expedite a re-order since I had no TV, they did not care and I envisioned another 7 days in addition to the 2 day processing to get the new TV, I was offered a 10% discount for the 'inconvenience' BTW. So, beware ordering online from Walmart, the time to order and receive is horrendous, and if damaged replacement is another endless process.  I cancelled the replacement, and ordered from Best Buy with 2 DAY DELIVERY. Saved myself 8 days without a TV if i had kept the order with Walmart. NEVER AGAIN"
3208,46719,Gill,25/06/2019,Walmart,"1st time ordering from Walmart online. 2 days delivery. Ordered a package of t-shirts that you can't really find at the store. This is Walmart, and NOT a 3rd party seller on Walmart.com.  My item should be arriving as promised. 1st time, maybe not the last. Truth be told, I still prefer Amazon on the ordering process."

3210,44967,Latisha Grimes,25/06/2020,Walmart,"Looks like Walmart decided to pick a side. This made me sick to read. Copied and pasted from a private group on FB.  My husband is a good man. My husband is not perfect. My husband makes mistakes. My husband is the type of person that would help anyone at any time. My husband is a police officer. Today I watched the light in my husband and my son's eyes leave. Today I had to defend one of the bravest men I have ever met.  Let's back up a bit. Today is Sunday, June 14th, 2020. Our family went to church as we do every Sunday. After church, we ran to Walmart in Grove Oklahoma. This is not unusual for our family, in fact, this is almost always a weekly trip. Someone has forgotten something and we zip over to Walmart and pick up what we need.  Today changed that for our family. We will never return to Grove Walmart or any other Walmart. While in the store a message repeatedly played over the loudspeaker. This message stated that Walmart understands white privilege exist and supports Black lives matter. It went on to say how they support the black community and acknowledge the injustices committed by the law enforcement agencies. I watched my nine-year-old son whip his head around and the light goes out in my husband's eyes. We decided to leave the store. My husband was just going to leave and not say anything to anyone. But I had to show my son that his father was a good man and that sometimes we have to stand up for what is right.  I asked our check out person if she would please get a manager for us. She said why maybe I can help. I said no please just call a manager. She refused. She looked at my husband and asked him to tell her why I wanted a manager. My husband replied that the message on the speaker is directly against his line of work and that it was not friendly towards the police department. She responded with I am no longer comfortable speaking with you. He said that is fine but you asked what was wrong so I told you. She said I did ask but I no longer want to know. I said that it is fine could you please call the manager my husband and I would like to speak with the manager. He is a police officer and would like to address this issue. At this time she said that she would not serve us at all because he was a police officer and she just walked away. She left us with half of our order rang up. I looked at the lady behind me with tears in my eyes and she told my husband thank you for your service.  Some other checkers came and finished the purchase. A few minutes later two male employees came up. The manager asked what happened. When we told him he said that she had the right to not serve anyone. My husband agreed with that. My husband told the manager that he didn't expect Walmart to back Blue lives but he did think of the very least for impartiality. The manager proceeded to tell us that corporate feel like there are more black people than law enforcement and that money is more important to the corporation than law enforcement and their families. He said this was Walmart's corporate policy. I asked the man so Walmart is not going to support law enforcement officers at all? His response was no not as long as they were making more money from the people in this movement. So this tells me that they only care about money. The manager said that people at corporate make the decisions and they have to play the message. Another officer came up and showed his badge asked about the broadcast and we told him about how we were treated and that Walmart corporation feels that law enforcement can be refused service just for being police officers his face registered utter shock. My son was devastated. We were treated like criminals. My husband was devastated. This is what These black lives matter and defund the police is causing. This is not okay. I am a proud LEO wife, I am proud of my husband. My husband may save that lady someday but still, she will hate him."
3211,44968,Karen Maas,25/06/2020,Walmart,I was in the walmart on rt 19 in new port richey Florida. They have many customers who are NOT wearing their masks. Store Manager why arent you on the floor handling this situation?
3212,44969,Cheryl Race,25/06/2020,Walmart,The Walmart in Western Hills Cincinnati is the absolute worse! The parking lot is filthy and the store is not much better. The employees act like they would rather be anywhere but there. There is no pride in working there! It is not located in the best neighborhood so it doesnâ€™t attract the best clientele. I try to avoid that store whenever possible! Clean up your stores Walmart! Make it a place that is pleasant to shop in and pleasant to work in!
3213,44970,Whiskkers,25/06/2020,Walmart,"Walmart.com is a scam. I ordered a ""New"" battery operated cordless drill and received a used one, I tried getting it swapped out and only got the run around, no product, no refund. A few other times I purchased items only to have them mark the item as ""shipped and delivered"" and never receiving the item. Again they refused to issue any credit because ""Our records show it was delivered"". They always put you in a your word against theirs situation. I think all delivery services should do what Amazon does and photograph the delivery; post office as well. I've lost hundreds of dollars using Walmart.com but no more, I refuse to spend another dollar with them online or in their local stores."
3214,44971,Jane,25/06/2020,Walmart,Walmart has become the most horrible place to deal with.. I have went online for over a month to place order tells me I have to go to the store.. It shows available only in store. Get to the store for them to tell me it wasn't on the truck. Walmart is horrible with updates online
3215,36312,Ajay K.,25/06/2019,Amazon Go,Super convenient. I wish this was omnipresent across all airports/train stations/inside office buildings. It is hands down the most efficient way to shop when you're in a rush or on the move. The Vietnamese chicken and Jamaican salads are particularly great. They also have a good number of Indian dishes that need to be heated up. I only wish the store was bigger and I wish they had more hot food/fresh food options (although I don't know if the technology would be able to support that).
3216,42974,Rodney Little,25/06/2021,Walmart,"I ordered delivery of my groceries 6/23. Supposed to be here between 12 & 1. Was not delivered as scheduled. Then left milk, eggs etc outside my door sometime. When I found it it was hot and spoiled. Called store was told would be delivered within an hour. No delivery. Called customer service. They stated that they talked to store manager and would be delivered in a hour. No delivery. Called customer service. Same crap. Called a 230Pm told be delivered in a hour. Itâ€™s 7pm still no delivery. If you need groceries go somewhere else. Walmart is full of liars from top to bottom. Will never use Walmart for anything. No such thing as honesty."
3217,42975,TTV_FLOW,25/06/2021,Walmart,I went there to get my tires fixed and they put the wrong tires on my truck wrong lovenuts and then told me they couldn't help
3218,42976,shernelle charles,25/06/2021,Walmart,"The customer service is absolutely terrible. You can't speak with anyone in Canada about your concerns. Representatives are rude, loud, and disrespectful! Maggie-PNM! and Ric83008! should be retrained on customer service. Would not recommend using or applying for a Walmart card. There is no assistance and everyone will keep forwarding you to different departments. ""Supervisors"" are not trained and of no assistance to resolve yours issues. Walmart MasterCard rewards program is not worth the poor customer service to resolve ANY issue. Representatives accused me of lying and raised his voice continuously. Completely offensive and abusive comments by the â€œsupervisionsâ€."
3219,42977,Tina Hawkins,25/06/2021,Walmart,"Never again will I order online. If you have to return thru mail, it takes forever to get refund back. Yesterday my refund was back on my debit card. I went to use my card, used a small sum. Today my card didnt work. I check with my bank and I'm overdrafts 72.00! The reason? They cancelled my refund and took my money back off my card and they dont know who authorized it. Now I'm stuck with an overdraft fee and I have to wait another 10 business days to get my money back again! My bank won't forgive it since it wasn't a bank error."
3220,42978,Jeffrey Bower,25/06/2021,Walmart,"the walmart.com, the walmart stores and the app all have the worst customer service!! i have been trying to update a review that i have posted on my recent order and talking to customer service thought i was trying to reset my password and that was not what i need!! i have tried to explain to them that i NEED to ""UPDATE POSTED REVIEW"", how hard is it for someone to answer that!!"

3222,42980,Ð Ðœ,25/06/2021,Walmart,I ordered kitchen aid kettles (37 kettles). And seller bargain corner has been sent not Kitchen aid. I received another kettles Hamilton beach. I started to return this kettles because that looks really like a scam. And what did walmart? He blocked me!! Because I did refund. I explained the situation and called a lot of times to Walmart. I asked them to check this seller. But no. They blocked me! I spent a lot of my time and lot of my nervous. Thank you walmart! Good luck you and Bargain corner. Lose your customers and deceive them further. You need to check your partners and not block clients. Good job.  Adeliia Klinkova

3224,47086,Rebecca,26/06/2018,Walmart,Recently I begin to ordering the clean supplies from Walmart. It helps me keep away from spending more money when I go to shop. The clean supplies are seem with the supplies I brought. It's more convenient for me.
3225,46710,Hannah,26/06/2019,Walmart,"Ordered a cute pair of size 6 shoes and delivery took about a week. Upon receiving the shoes, I see that the box says size 6 but notice that the bottom of the shoe itself says 7. Upon further inspection, the inner sole of the shoe says size 6.5. All in all, I am confused and the shoes are too big. Iâ€™m requesting a return and replacement but thereâ€™s no option to explain whatâ€™s wrong, so weâ€™ll see how that goes ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸"
3226,46711,Laura Vance,26/06/2019,Walmart,"I placed an online order with WalMart, through my established account. I recently moved and unfortunately did not update my address until after the order was entered. I realized my mistake immediately after submitting my order, so looked to see how I could correct the error.  I was unable to edit so tried to cancel the order, perhaps 3-5 minutes after it was placed and told that it wasn't a guaranteed cancel. Meaning, you cant cancel your order with WalMart.  Next, I contacted WalMart customer service to see if they could cancel it with a guarantee or update the address. I was informed to wait 48 hrs, even though the packages were to be delivered in that same time frame. So I then decided to update the addresse or hold at a FedEx location through FedEx. Here I was informed that the shipper, WalMart, put restrictions on shipping so they were unable to do anything.  Then, I decided to call WalMart to have them change the address through FedEx. They informed me all they could do is add a note with the new address. If there were issues with delivery to the wrong address FedEx would call WalMart and get the new address.  First, this is WalMart, so I was not expecting stellar service. However, I can't believe they're not able to cancel an order before it has shipped. Second, I work for a company that ships product out and as long as the package is not on its way to the final destination, it's a pretty good chance the address can be changed or it can be held at a FedEx location.  This may not mean a lot but I won't be shopping at Walmart again."
3227,46712,Tommy Pryor,26/06/2019,Walmart,Idk what is wrong with a lot of people. I freaking love Walmart. They have almost anything you can think of.
3228,46713,Cori,26/06/2019,Walmart,"So I bought a 2 in one car seat and stroller combo and when it arrived I received the car seat but not the stroller. So I called and they said to my luck that one is no longer in stock, well they refunded me the money but then a month or so passed and I noticed they charged me yet again for this item. So I called and the resolution team was so disrespectful and rude this lady today me the refund will not be given back because it already was back in March, but when I told her about the new one they recharged she said that there was nothing to be done I bought the item so they had to charge me, when I explained what happened she said she saw that in the notes but seen I was refunded that money so this time they couldnâ€™t. I was livid you recharged me for an item that was not received and then tell me there is nothing u can do. Never shop here again"
3229,46714,George,26/06/2019,Walmart,I'm guessing they are trying to compete with Amazon... I ordered jars of pickles and they busted everyone of the jars then didn't have any to replace the broken ones.. My suggestion is pay a few more dollars for Amazon and avoid headaches...NEVER AGAIN
3230,44960,Jessie Brader,26/06/2020,Walmart,"If four kids so we use their grocery delivery service constantly several times a month especially during the pandemic. Two weeks ago (because that's how long it took to sort out) for some reason our order paused at the preparing section even though we were fully charged and the order was delivered which meant that we never got the substitution or at a stock list now this order was for just under $500 I had to go through and systematically check to see everything that was missing and it came to be about $125. I called they told me that the system would update and the next day it would be accurate and it would see delivered and we would get the refund for the stuff that they did not have in stock that didn't happen, this went on for 4 days. every single time I called I was repeatedly told that either I wasn't allowed to talk to a supervisor because there are there were none or they weren't allowed to take customer calls because they were too busy with calls to which point I asked well who were they talking to if they're not allowed to talk to customers and then I was told they don't know because right now they're working from home and have no idea who's doing what. I spoke to several different people and was told multiple times that my argument was being escalated I was given to them storm manager at the physical store several times who repeatedly asked me to give her the list of every single item and what it cost to which every time I started when she realized that this was so much stuff she would stop me and tell me that someone else would call me back and hang up on me repeatedly. The third time this happened the manager for some reason kept asking me if I wanted to speak Spanish instead I don't know why she kept doing this I kept saying no I don't speak Spanish I don't understand why you're asking me this, at which point she eventually gave me to a Spanish person seeking person who after a minute was very confused when I kept insisting that no I don't speak Spanish nor do I want to try to do that. eventually I finally got to a customer service person who ultimately did an incredibly illegal refund The amount of stuff we were missing was mostly non-food In fact I think the food total came to maybe $14 the rest was predominantly cleaning supplies and baby stuff The food stuff had been paid with food stamps but the rest was off my debit card they proceeded to do the refund based off a previous order and put all of it into food stamps so they ended up illegally putting a crap ton of money on food stamps and I still have yet to have anyone fix this. Walmart I hate you so very much. And yes the status on the order is still listed as just preparing."
3231,44961,kathy Scheer,26/06/2020,Walmart,I had to give one star but Walmart doesn't deserve even one star. They don't let you try on clothes in a dressing room. So I bought some clothes and brought them home to try on. They were too big and now Walmart won't take them back. The staff at the door showed me a very small sign on the front door stating I have to call them in 6 weeks to see if they will even take them back at all. Today I got a dog bed which is too small for my daughters dog. I tried calling Walmart but of course they aren't answering the phones. After three times I gave up. Goodbye Walmart.
3232,44962,Thomas Koivisto,26/06/2020,Walmart,"I wanted a refund for an item. They made a return label for me to print. I cannot print with my laptop. The system told me one could be sent to me, like I got one from Amazon. The customer service person I talked to was totally incompetent in doing her job. I had to, in a chat, tell her the item 4 times, go over the situation more times, she could not find the order, one time came back with another item, as if she could not read English. I had to go back in their system to get the order number for her, it's the only time I ordered that item that I told her what it was. she finally got someone else who told me they could not send me a label, the first person couldn't do that much, They would give me a refund without sending it back, forget returning it. The whole process only took more than 70 MINUTES."

3234,44964,Bill Jenkins,26/06/2020,Walmart,"I don't have time to relate the many ways Walmart has given terrible service. This is partly because Walmart has wasted so much of my time dealing with their service. Mainly its been about items being out of stock and further that a customer doesn't know this until they place the order. But there's just been a comedy of screw ups they've made on my orders. They will try to blame Covid Virus. BUT! I used Jet.com with great service before WM. Then, all well before Covid, they took over Jet. The service immediately started to drop. And this was well before any effect from Covid virus."
3235,44965,Leanne Sydoriak,26/06/2020,Walmart,"Some little idiot overcharged me by $60 for Easter merchandise listed as 90% off, then rang up four items over a dozen times - most of the time without the 90% off either. Iâ€™ve been trying to get my money back since APRIL. Multiple calls to CS, where they sent my info to a manager in the entirely wrong state. They keep referring me to a store manager, but theyâ€™ve never once answered a call. If you make the mistake of shopping with Walmart, watch every single price, because after all of this, I have no doubt they do this on purpose hoping we wonâ€™t notice."
3236,44966,Judy Bristow,26/06/2020,Walmart,"Sunday I placed an order with Walmart.com. The items I ordered were for next day delivery. After I placed the order, I received a confirmation stating my order would be delivered the next day. I got up to find an E-mail saying the items would be delivered on Tuesday. I called Customer Service and explained my items were for next day delivery, the woman I spoke to looked up my order, she said I was right, then she send me a $15.00 eGift card for the inconvenience."
3237,36268,Pam A.,26/06/2018,Amazon Go,"Pretty cool concept. I can see the appeal for those looking for something convenient in the city. The store, attached to the Day 1 building, is a little small and can definitely feel cramped as people start piling in. Grab and go essentially. Not a huge selection, but you can get the basics here (cheese, salads, snacks beverages, and meal kits). It did feel weird to put stuff in my bag and just walk out. I was half expecting someone to tap me on the shoulder or an alarm to go off. Make sure you download the Amazon Go app before going in. You can tap others in under your account."
3238,42973,c roitsch,26/06/2021,Walmart,Absolutely horrible! Amazon...they are not! They lost my order and it's an act of congress to try and reach customer service. Fedex delivered a flat empty Walmart envelope that was literally ripped open! The item should have never been sent in an envelope in the first place!! Avoid online anything with Walmart. They just don't have their act together enough to deal with online purchases and shipping!
3239,46707,Terry Terry,27/06/2019,Walmart,"As useless as a fried piece of dog crap. Online order to be picked up. After 3 hours ""ready to pick up"". Pick up machine after scanning barcode ""Please monitor screen and wait"". Frigging screen is broken (and according to dumb employees, has been for weeks). Nobody shows up to deliver anything. Walking over to service desk, they cannot even get a hold on somebody. 10 minutes later some :experienced employee bee"" shows up and finally gets all my parts on the table (tractor battery, spark plug and a bottle Chemtool B-12 injector/carburetor cleaner) and tells me that these are ""restricted items"" and he needs to see my drivers license. I tell him to get a manager as I did not need my license to pick up the stuff I already paid for. Another 10 minutes with any of the morons showing up, then the assistant manager telling me it is their ""policy"" to ask for a license for their ""restricted items"". I told him to shove it up the other end of his mouth and left. Nothing about any ""restricted items"" or having a photo id requirement.  !!!! WALMART - F>>K OFF YOU MOTHERF>>>ING RET>>>S !!!!"
3240,46708,Howard Laucella,27/06/2019,Walmart,Came home after 11 had to use full service checkout as self service closes 11. As usual I didn't come home with everything I paid for. I wonder why they close self service check out at 11. Just thinking this time it was 2 cans of corn. last time 2 frozen dinners. What will it be next?
3241,46709,Agatha Vournas Mantanes,27/06/2019,Walmart,horrible place sells 3rd party items that cant be returned.
3242,44955,Alma Hernandez,27/06/2020,Walmart,If I could give them 0 stars I would. I understand we are going through a pandemic and that was the reason why I decided to purchase some personalized gifts online a month prior father's day. I didn't obtain any updates or tracking information on my order. Walmart absolutely cannot complete with Amazon if they are trying (lacking) and that shows. The experience ordering gifts for father's day was horrible because it was ruined since I did not receive my items. Never again! In general worse experience ever!
3243,44956,Stephen Wayne Busch,27/06/2020,Walmart,"Went to Walmart in Vidor Tx. and picked up a box of shells 100 of them, I look for the other day and apparently they moved the boxes around because 30 seconds after paying for them I realized they were the wrong gauge. Have not even walked out of the store yet and went to the service desk to exchanged them the guy says ok and I went and grabbed the right ones I get back and this door greeter comes over and says we can not exchange bullets. So beware once Walmart gets our money your stuck with something you can not even use. I left the store at that point."

My only other option was go on the website. The website gave me a delivery date of Saturday, June 27, 2020, which was perfect because that's the day I needed it by. Saturday comes and no TV. I called to see what was going on and the customer service rep stated the delivery company only delivers Mon-Fri. I was NOT happy because that's not what the website stated. Had I knew that, I would've NEVER ordered from you. At that point there was nothing more I could do, but wait. Monday rolls around, I get an email stating my package was delivered. It was odd because it required a signature and I know I didn't sign for it. I had my daughter go out to check the porch and there was no TV in sight. I called Walmart, they transferred me to FedEX and what would you know, my package was delivered to the wrong house!! Someone signed for my package that I never even heard of. I will NEVER do business with Walmart again!! The absolute worst experience I've ever had and I'll make sure I let everyone know!"

Have thrown out so much food because no checks the dates!
3265,44948,Donre Domio,29/06/2020,Walmart,If I could give Wal Mart a zero rating that is what they would get. Why would you not take returns at this time. There is no way I'll continue to shop at Wal Mart. This is why the employees don't want to work for your company. Wal Mart please do better by serving your community.

3270,42959,Jaye Trites,29/06/2021,Walmart,"Walmart On-Line Shopping Fiasco! Three weeks ago I bought a small bedside table from Walmart On-Line Shopping because it seems that this is the only way you can get items anymore. When notice was sent to me that my order was ready for pick-up, I went to my local store in Grande Prairie, AB and they said that they would bring the item right out. While outside waiting in their designated parking area, I noticed that vehicles that had arrived after I did, were receiving their big grocery orders before me but I foolishly waited patiently over 20 mins until I got fed up and then went into the store Customer Service Desk to investigate. Here I stood for another 15 mins in line until it was my turn and when the Walmart Pick-Up staff were summoned and arrived at the desk, I was informed that they were unable to locate my package because they believed that the day staff had put it somewhere and that I should call Walmart the next day to inquire with them. Called the next day and the staff said that they would look for my item and call me when found - They NEVER called me back and so ended calling them again and again because I kept receiving notifications that my package was in the store, ready for pick-up. Finally, I took matters into my own hands and contacted Walmart at the Customer Service phone number provided for On-Line Shopping and was informed that the product was supplied by a 3rd-party partner, SaveOnMany and that Walmart would contact them via eMail regarding my order - I received a reply from them within 24-hrs. SaveOnMany said it was shipped over two weeks ago by FedEx and gave me their tracking number to give to my Walmart so that they could find the package. Called Walmart Pick-Up staff and even with this updated information, they were unable to find the item. At this point, I finally conceded that I was beaten by the situation and I cancelled my order. Just wanted to share with other people my terrible experience and put this frustrating incident behind me and to let ""All n Sundry"" know that I vow to NEVER use Walmart On-Line Disaster Shopping Again!"

And then you have these personal shoppers doing this online they Park their carts in the middle of the Isles and then when you try to get around them that you give you attitude but as if you're in their way no we're in there supporting your company so therefore they should make it available for your customers to get up and down the aisle Walmart has become one of the most unfriendly disgusting as far as employee presentability, friendliness."
3273,42962,Haelah Shammasi,29/06/2021,Walmart,"If I can give zero stars I would and I hope the CEO reads this review. The unethical business practice in staling online orders to have customers cancel their order and order again at a high price or staling the shipping because they raised the price of the item and want people to pay the higher price, is ridiculous. Yet the person who ordered the item before the price was jacked up with the higher demand donâ€™t get their original order. I ordered a TV stand on June 22 for the regular price of $168 and it should have arrived today June 29, however my order was still being prepared till today and when I called a day before to see what is the problem because I found out that they have raised the price to $255 for the item and there were only 5 left. The first representative I spoke with said it should be shipped â€œtodayâ€ which was Monday June 28 and I should receive a shipping email. By the end of the day on Monday June 28 I still had not received anything, so I called costumer service again and the representative I spoke with told me that the item is delayed because it was high in demand and that there is a possibility that my order would be canceled. Since that time I have spoken to 5 different representatives who kept telling me that the item is high in demand and that they might have to cancel my order. I asked to speak to a manger after calling for two days and they put me on hold for 26 minutes each time in till it disconnected with no chance to talk to a manger. This is unacceptable business dealing â€œstalingâ€ to get a high price and not allowing customers to talk to a manger to deal with a problem. I had to reorder the item and get the price adjusted to the original price I was paying and now they say I will have to wait till July 13 to revive my item, however there is no guarantee that I will receive my item even then. So now not only did I wait a week for my order that never shipped but I have to wait even longer and had to deal with 5 different people which was stressful and unnecessary. I WILL NEVER SHOP AT WALMART AGAIN!!"
3274,42963,Thomas Landsiedel,29/06/2021,Walmart,Ordered label maker tape on 6/16/2021. Even though I gave them my address it was sent to the WRONG address. 6/29/2021 still waiting. This is BS.
3275,42964,Marianne Kent,29/06/2021,Walmart,"I used to go to Walmart all the time. However that is no longer going to happen because it is to hard to find anything, it gives me anxiety, and I spend more time in line waiting to pay for my groceries and items than it takes me to shop for them. Which means a trip that should be in and out usually takes me an hour or more. The store is unorganized, unkept, you pay more and than they have those self check outs which I don't ever use and only 1 real live cashier working anymore. Walmart corporate is really making a mess out of their stores."
3276,42965,Jay Fennell,29/06/2021,Walmart,"I'd give it a negative number if I could. Bought a new phone, Sim card, and a month of unlimited data. They refused to get my phone going online and said to take it to a retail store and they would resolve the situation. The coach at the store passed the buck back to a third party seller and he said he could do it but he wasn't going to do it. I have a worthless phone and no service. They basically stole my money. I will do everything in my power to keep everyone I know from shopping at this retailer."

3279,40506,Mel,29/06/2022,Walmart,I will never purchase from Walmart online again. I did not realize they do not pull it until an hour before you get there. Therefore my items are always out of stock. Most stores pull the items when you purchase them and hold them for you. I am not sure who's brilliant idea it is to do this. But I'm guessing they pale in comparison to anybody else online If they want to compete with Amazon they have a long long way to go if ever. I will never purchase from here again
3280,46702,Kelly,30/06/2019,Walmart,"I visited walmart here in Portage, My favorite one....and really as always..had a very positive experience with a couple of employees, It was when I went to the auto department looking for some R-13 freon for my car, not very familiar with car repair, okay,Ill say it...Im a woman...lol,...anyways... I asked the question to anyone who was at the counter....about what type of freon I needed...the female at the counter started to go with me, but one of the males named Robert, went to the isle with me..long story short..I felt that he really did go over and above..I was suspicious at first when he kept with me, asking, If I needed certain things like leak proof or other stuff, I asked him ..what are you trying to up-sale me for a higher commision or something? he said, nope..I don't get commission, I just want to make sure you have all the right things you will need. ..He even checked all my fluids in my car, after having me drive around to the port...he cleaned my battery cables which he had discovered, which was why my car was not starting, until I jiggle the cable or cleaned the acid accumulated around the connectors,... and recommended a reasonably priced treatment to keep them clean and even put them on after I paid for them...  His Manager Eli, came out to check on us ..also a very nice respectful guy...he too was helpful..I felt so valued... really... I got better service from them, than when I've driven to a auto shop to ask for an estimate. So, I just had to give them both high accolades for their unselfish service... I will definitely return. Great Job Robert and ELi..you are Appreciated"

You cannot get any help from the Walmart help centre, my email was not responded to, my chat resulted in the conclusion that I must contact the thrid party seller, walmart cannot help, although they cashed my payment.

This was a gift for fathers day and it's now almost 2 weeks past and going on into the next month I'm extremely disappointed in your services and that's why your getting a single star rating.

3295,42956,Pumpkin Pie,30/06/2021,Walmart,"Ordered a window AC with 2 day shipping. Realized my billing address was incorrect when confirmation email arrived (because app doesn't let you double-check before submitting order). Call customer service, Rep1 tells me I need to cancel the order. Ask for a supervisor. Sup1 explains she can absolutely change my billing address without canceling the order. After hanging up, I get an email that my order was cancelled and now there's a new order scheduled to arrive 3 days later. Back to the phone. Rep2 says nothing he can do. Sup2 tells me she's so sorry throws money at me, and will send a request for Saturday delivery ASAP. Saturday arrives, package is at distribution center but doesn't make the truck. Also says signature required by Walmart but a call to FedEx says no signature required. Call again. Rep3 tells me it's out of his hands. Sup3 calls FedEx but call disconnects when he comes back from hold. He never calls back. Rep4 transfers me to Sup4, who calls FedEx to confirm I don't have to wait to sign, but package will arrive sometime Monday.  Now, at this point, I tell them I had paid for the installation and had an appointment scheduled for Monday at 2. What if the AC isn't there. They say no worries, I can cancel anytime before 1:30.  Monday @ 12:00, notification that package was delivered. We finish shopping and return home to find a CAMPER MATTRESS has been delivered. Who ya gonna call? Yep, tell Rep5 to just give me a supervisor. Sup5 has no idea how this mistake was made. But they'll order another one at no cost and with no further holds on my card (I already have 2 from the original order and the one Sup1 made when she cancelled my order to change the billing address). I explain the whole situation to Sup5, who throws more money back at me and tells me I shouldn't have worried about the billing address because the card would've gone through anyway. Ask for expedited shipping. He tells me they aren't allowed to request such things. I point out Sup3 did it. He sees no record on my order that any expediting was requested. So now from Monday, because it's after 12PM, I have to wait til Thursday. Doesn't matter that the original order was made at 3PM on Wednesday and Friday delivery was estimated.  I have $240 from this purchase being added back to my card, but somehow have THREE holds on funds on my card now, because they actually put a hold on funds for the replacement too. I get to speak to Supervisor 6 tomorrow because as of 10PM on Tuesday night, this product is still in preparation. Soooo....we are going to be at at least 8 days waiting to receive this ""free 2 day shipping"" item. I've been scouring local stores but no one has anything above 10000 BTUs in stores.  Oh, yeah. Sup5 also assured me he cancelled the installation appointment. Guess who showed up at 2PM? Yeah, the installer who was never notified. Nice guy, offered to install the camper mattress in our window to block the sun.  This has been the most frustrating order of my life. No one can give me the same answer twice, they can't ship the proper item even with a 4 day lead, and their solution to making it right is to refund money. Comes a point where money doesn't make up for the pool of sweat I'm living in."
3296,40502,dudeabar,30/06/2022,Walmart,"I will never order online from Walmart EVER again. The lazy picker didn't find my product on the shelf and just said it was out of stock. We went to the store and talked with a team lead who said they had 5 in stock but not on the shelf. When they brought it to the front however they told me I COULDN""T have it unless I charged my card AGAIN because they had pushed the order to the next stage which should have been to offer me a different similar product or offer another store as an option but that never happened. So here I am with $115 charged on my CC the product sitting right in front of my face but I can't have it. Then because it's 4th of July weekend they tell me it will take over a week to get my CC charge back. ABSOLUTE TRASH SERVICE AND POLICIES!"

Yes, occasionally, something is missing from my order, but with a quick phone call to customer service, they credit it back to me quickly.  When I arrive to pick up my order, check-in online, with the app, or via phone is easy.  The grocery handler are ALWAYS pleasant and polite. I love the convenience of shopping online at night and picking up my order the next day! Plus, I do not ""impulse shop"" online! Great service. Grade: A-"
3300,47062,Melanie,13/07/2018,Walmart,When you go into a supermarket you think that the checkouts would be open no trolleys with this checkout is closed everyone only express checkout and self service!! Were open Then to top it off they took someone of customer care to serve on person at the checkouts making sure the trolley was put back so no one else could be served I had to ask if they were going to put more checkouts? If I had not asked they would not have put one more on .when there was 4 people with full trolleys. I went to customer care asked to speak to a manger the assistant manger Andrea could not even be bothered to come and speak to me it seem to be to much to ask for 3 times they called for her to come to customer service !! I have now put it in the hands of head office

Two days later and 30 mins on the phone to walmart, it still has not refunded my money and based on my horrible past experience, this is what will happen: it will be delivered. I will take to the store to return it and they will tell me it cant be returned at store level. I will contact the seller and have to be dicked around by them with at least 6 emails back and forth with them trying to weasel out of their return policy. Walmart has gone to hell. Their customer service is outrageously incompetent. I've spent hours on hold just to trying to get my refund. No more, I'm NEVER using walmart.com again."

It really was ridiculous, now I'm stuck getting rid of them. Thanks alot walmart.com shipping!"
3305,44875,Paul Rock,13/07/2020,Walmart,"Now that Walmart has security at the front door enforcing facial coverings I should feel safer, but I don't! The security guard doesn't wear his properly, wasn't he instructed in the proper way to wear one frim management? He has it barely covering his mouth, as his nostrils are flaring when he yaps with customers! He should be setting the example of the proper way to cover your face, instead he thanked me for my comments and continued to yap with customers while exposing us all to possible droplets coming out of his nose! Half of employees still have their masks drooped around their chins, as well as some shoppers, but dont ask them to wear it properly, you will become the bad guy who should mind his or her own business!

3307,44877,Michael Smith,13/07/2020,Walmart,Worst customer service anywhere. I bought a lawnmower battery. It won't keep a charge even when it's out of the mower. I accessed the receipt on the iPhone app and started a return and bring it to customer service. They scan it and tell me it's a battery and I need to bring it to auto. Brought it to auto and they don't know how to scan it in. Wait 15 minutes for a supervisor who can't help either. I call customer service and explain this and the transfer me to Store Customer relations. They can't help with an app problem and transfer me back to customer service. They try to call the store with me on the line and after 18 rings they hang up on me. Walmart hires incompetent people who can't process a simple return for a defective product. Shop at your own risk. They just stole $44.95 from me an refused to help. Thank God it wasn't a television!
3308,36439,Ian B.,13/07/2018,Amazon Go,Great concept and very accurate in counting my items and sending me my receipt.. but food quality is poor.. if they can get some decent tasting items on the shelf it will be a great success..
3309,36206,Chelsea L.,13/07/2021,Amazon Go,"I genuinely can't remember if this was the place where I could use my palm as an ID to walk in but I'm assuming it's this one.  I'm really conflicted. I hate how Amazon is ruining local small businesses but this concept is brilliant. There is no wait at all. I love the technology but I'm also still a bit creeped out. I registered my palm ID with just my cell phone number and a credit card, yet somehow Amazon connected that information with my prime account. I did not consent to that but my god they are smart.  It's a pretty cool convenience store but they are pricey. If you're a tourist, consider getting the Seattle Chocolate. They're priced at $3 and everywhere else they're pretty expensive ($4.50 at whole foods and $5 at SeaTac airport).  I would like to bring attention to Brian H's review since apparently both the food quality and selection have gone down. They also used to highlight local food instead of Amazon brands... Amazon please do better in corporate responsibility!!!!"

Few days later they say it got misplaced in the transit. Got my refund back but never wasting my time ordering my stuff from Walmart online. It really sucks especially when they give you false information that the package was delivered when it wasnâ€™t. Disappointing!
3312,42895,Angela Fox,13/07/2021,Walmart,"So I guess I am no longer going to shop or order online from Walmart. My last 3 orders have all just gone completely wrong! First order was a dresser, that one just got completely lost in transit, yes Walmart re-sent another one but to finally get what I ordered took almost 4 weeks and then when I did get it it had been damaged from transit. Very disappointing. Second order was a 3 drawer storage on wheels for my mothers medical supplies, when they delivered it the entire to was bend and damaged. Seriously!!! Now my last and FINAL ORDER i will ever do with Walmart again is LOST!! Fedex says it was delivered but 3 of the items were not delivered, I am so beyond frustrated at this point. You would think being a large corporation and with the last almost two years of most people ordering online that they would have a better system in place. I WANT MY STUFF I PAID FOR IT!"

Tried calling customer service three times and might as well have banged my head against a brick wall. I have never in my life been so frustrated!

3317,40445,Richard,13/07/2022,Walmart,"How about this. I shop walmart regularly. Today I needed a few items. I received sticker shock when I hit the candy aisle. Prices jumped 20% overnight. I thought I inflation was just under 9%. Yes, I have seen everything go up there lately, but just way above inflation. Could be that they gave employees way too much of a raise (for what little they do). Or maybe because they're putting a new neon signage outside the store. P.S. I used to work for a sign company and know the expense involved. Or maybe because there are several brand new cart corrals at the end of their parking lot waiting to replace the perfectly usable ones they already have. (Oh, I also used to be a welder and know the cost for material and labor for those things.) So, ain't just inflation driving up their prices. It's the frivolous unnecessary crap."

Ask for receipt, why order not filled? What name made my order? Why no reason to not fill it? Hygiene you have. You don't check out the order before delivery? Why not? Lies to me & says the full order is there. Nope. Not caring about me & my questions.. Just wanted to go. At check out wouldn't let me do the free delivery so was forced to pay the $9.99 & pushed for $15.00 delivery tipping, check to be sure it wasn't taken & when I wanted to add to my order I get told to do that meant I'd have to do the whole order over. And being in the store I see those shoppers just toss & throw the stuff in the crates & with heavy stuff on the potato chips on the bottom. Don't care. All hopefully not so. Awful overall experience with annoying useless robot contact included I won't be on line ordering again doing this headache with an hr. with customer service to be refunded & to fix irresponsible shopper's mistakes again. Thoughtlessness uncaring in store shoppers,I got one, hope their not all this way.. And have to wait for 5 days to get my money refunded back to me?? Will check on that. Going to double check for 3 same items ordered customer service said it wasn't on the order.. Equates to $60. I placed this order yesterday, Tuesday, July 12, 2022. Itemize your ordered items down to product bulk size, microwave brand, wattage, & be specific in food size/ounces, ECT. for pricing, so you have backing as you won't get a receipt. And how the stuff was bagged & yes your getting plastic bagged charged.. This advice isn't approval to shop on line with them (an uncaring employed money greed filled co.) I did, I tried,& know this about them yet I don't drive & needed the microwave...Got it. And it just didn't turn out ok not getting the whole order.. A manager follow up for ordered orders completely filled, & if not why not for customer notification, NOOO subbing, give shopper's signed receipt in the order co signed by the manager for customer's returns, have a manager co sign the order for delivery, be RESPONSIBLE/CARING unto SHOPPING for & bagging out customer's ORDER & with handle with care delivery also. Management follow through accountability shopping for OUR Paid items.."

3320,40448,Terry Hancock,13/07/2022,Walmart,"RE: Walmart in Socorro, NM  HORRIBLE service. NO check out available, for the umpteenth time this summer.  Asked staff, who were doing absolutely NOTHING near self check out, about a ""real"" checkout and was effectively flipped off, as they went back to their phones. Disgusting.  I left my full shopping cart for them to restock. Encourage others to do the same.  Went to a local Brooks, got personal attention, a real checkout, and paid a few cents more.  It is as if Walmart is PUSHING me to more and more Amazon online."

Especially when the scanning window doesn't work well and things need to be scanned over and over again. If I scan once and put it back in the cart, then is it my fault? Craziness! There's enough stuff stolen, either on purpose or by mistake that it would pay to hire people to check everyone out."
3322,44862,Rikki Tuss Fonte,14/07/2020,Walmart,I ordered my daughter a pair of shorts for a team practice. They were shipped in the wrong size. Reordered. Came again in the wrong size. She is now without the shorts her entire team has. Their staff in the warehouse obviously canâ€™t read sizing!!!!!
3323,44863,charles landry,14/07/2020,Walmart,Walmart sucks nobody answers their phone You try to buy something it cost about $200 they don't want your money ya'll suck
3324,44864,Leev Pusey,14/07/2020,Walmart,"Never order from Walmart.com I ordered many items and their packaging is horrible. Just today I ordered 2 spaghetti sauces Prego they came by themselves in a box, I notice red was leaking underneath, box was sealed. I opened up to find in a large clear bag two bottles of Prego were both SHATTERED full of sauce! If someone had stuck their hand in or a child Walmart you would be sued! Do not and I repeat stay away from walmart.com. you will be sorry . This is not the only time I have had issues, but I felt I needed to post due to the safety today of this matter and this could have been worse medically if a hand was cut."
3325,44865,Richard Bourassa,14/07/2020,Walmart,"this thieving company should be going out of business by now. i bought a desk nook a couple of months ago, it came broken so i asked for a refund, they gave me the refund but then a couple of days later charged me for the item again and will not give me my refund back because it does not show in their system. i have called, sent emails with the proof from my bank account and yet i have not heard from them for two weeks now.  this is a garbage company i would give negative stars if i could. give me my damn money back you thieves."
3326,44866,Emily,14/07/2020,Walmart,"Ordered an $80 Hammock and what was delivered to me was a $30 on their site completely different than the one I had ordered. Complete rip off. Very disappointed in this establishment. Dont order for them online, they will not give you what you pay for!"
3327,44867,Faye,14/07/2020,Walmart,Made two different purchases in a month on the Walmart website. Both times I received a complete different item. The employees have ONLY ONE job to do and nobody seems to know which is it.  The second time they made me return the item ( what if I can't leave the house??? they should schedule a pick up too since the mistake is not mine ) and charged me taxes AGAIN for the replacement item.  NEVER BUYING FROM THIS CR** EVER AGAIN.
3328,44868,Jorge F,14/07/2020,Walmart,"I made a large order of gym puzzle flooring for a job project with a delivery date of almost a month from purchase, the month came along and I had a tracking number but Walmart warehouse never sent the items, the only solution they gave me was to reorder with a very small percentage off on all items again and they would not expedite on a timely manner even if it was their mistake to begin with, another month from reordering came along, keep in mind that I called customer service every other day (with an average waiting and talking time of two hours) each time, so we would not have the same issue again as the first order, when I believe that they should have been the ones calling me to make up for their errors, well the same thing happened on the second order, no one knew where my product was, they were annoyed by my calls and made me feel as if I was the one trying to take advantage of them by demanding some sort of fair adjustment since I had been paying interests for months since the first order and my credibility with my client was none existent since project was supposed to be completed months before based on delivery dates provided by walmart.com not by me, at the end out of 32 packages of puzzle flooring that I had paid for only 24 were delivered, so again walmart.com just washed their hands and said we are going to refund you for the other 8 missing, and that was one more of the many signs I had through all this nightmare, that Walmart does not care about their customers, they wont take responsibility for their wrong doing and will leave the customer hanging and dealing with it. They gave me a 50 GC (a total joke) after many calls and still made me feel as if I was trying to profit out of them, when they forgot all they had put me through and my ruptured relationship with my client was all their fault and their negligence to make things right for a customer."
3329,44869,Girt,14/07/2020,Walmart,"I went in the store to purchase an item I found online at a nice price. Once I finally found an employee to get the item out of a locked case, this employee wouldn't honor the price match that was on the website. The item clearly stated ""in-store purchase only 857 N Dobson Rd Mesa, AZ"". I was most certainly in-store and I had the item pulled up on my phone as not to waste time. The employee, LaLa, A) did not honor the price match, and B) never greeted me, she just hollered at another clown associate via her walkie talkie. She is rude, she possesses zero communication skills (unless screaming in a walkie talkie), and I pity her coworkers. This isn't an isolated event, those employees at every walmart I've been in lately are zombies. They don't want to help the customer and one of these days this negative energy will catch up to walmart. Plus, all of the information online about the employees' positive covid tests is very scary. I'll stay away and stay healthy. Small businesses need and appreciate the consumer."
3330,36197,elizabetha972,14/07/2018,Amazon Go,"Fun experience, prices are typical for the area What an experience! First you have to download he amazon go app, scan your phone, then you enter. The app tags you around the store while you choose your items. Once your done, walk out. Thatâ€™s it."
3331,36445,Patrick K.,14/07/2018,Amazon Go,"Neat first time experience, nothing like it where we live.  Easy to figure out app and there was someone there to help if needed.   Was skeptical about the charges but true to form what we walked out with was on the receipt regardless of what we picked up and put back."
3332,36301,Rebecca S.,14/07/2019,Amazon Go,This was actually pretty cool. Download the Amazon go app to your phone. Each individual entering the store must have the app to scan for the little gate to open to be allowed inside. Pick out your selections and than exit the store. Your app will show a pending receipt within a few minutes of exiting.
3333,42887,Cynthia Beckett,14/07/2021,Walmart,I ordered groceries from Walmart. They took $181.42 out of my account and canceled my order. So now I get to file a dispute and wait to receive my money back . What a joke. And customer care was no help. They beat around the bush to the point I will not shop at Walmart again! They acted like its no big deal just submit your order. Thatâ€™s what I will not be doing!
3334,42888,Danielle Garcia Fender,14/07/2021,Walmart,"Placed a grocery order to be delivered 1-2 pm. I got an email saying they were very busy and behind on deliveries but would let me know when to expect my delivery. By 4:34 no email update and no groceries. I contacted customer svc and was told that some items in my order didn't meet Walmart's standards for freshness so my order was canceled. Even if EVERY SINGLE ITEM HAD AN ISSUE, you don't cancel the order, you refill it. They didn't even bother to notify me - I had to call them. I have problems with almost every order. Always out of items. Or busyso delivery will ne delayed. One time my order was delivered to wrong house so they sent another right out express, but it had missing items. I had to place another order for the next morning and didn't even bother getting a refund because they make it such a pain in the ass. This is my last month paying to be abused by their incompetency."
3335,42889,Noemie Mimi,14/07/2021,Walmart,"Id give them 0 stars if I could. It would take too long to list all my grievences and theyve waisted hours of my time, but youd think with people waking up to the fact that theyre evil and we dont have to put up w them theyd have better customer service. Whatever its their own funeral and ill be doing a happy dance when they finally go out of business. We don't have to shop there because we're poor we can rely on each other."
3336,42890,Pamela Proffitt,14/07/2021,Walmart,"I order groceries for my mom and since COVID we started having them delivered. The â€œthird partyâ€ company Walmart+ was paid 99.00 for the delivery service. An order was placed, scheduled but never delivered. WalMart canceled the order. No one called us to tell us it wouldnâ€™t be delivered. A second order was placed and never delivered. The personnel at WalMart explained it was a third party, they call and no one shows up. I immediately cancelled the service. That was in April and my mom still hasnâ€™t received her money. WalMart gives you phone numbers for thisâ€third partyâ€ but no one answers or itâ€™s busy. SICK OF WALMART."
3337,42891,Cheryl Sage,14/07/2021,Walmart,"I ordered two pocketbooks that were adorable on the Walmart.com site. But when I recieved them they were nothing like the pictures. They were crushed and so cheaply made that they were unusable. The company that sold them listed so many steps to get my money back that I finally gave up. I'm disabled, I don't have a printer or car. I could not follow the steps required. Walmart does NOT look out for its customers. It is a joke. I can provide pictures as proof."
3338,42892,Rosalie Pedersen,14/07/2021,Walmart,I got a notification saying my order from Walmart was delivered right at the door when there was no package had to jump through hoops tp get a refund
3339,40437,Stacey,14/07/2022,Walmart,I will NEVER buy anything off Walmart.com again! I took a patio set back the same day I got it she said I will have my refund in 3-7days then called on the 7th day he said the same thingâ€¦ I told him itâ€™s been 7days and today I called on the 9th day and this guy tells me no thatâ€™s not correct it will be 3weeks!!
3340,40438,Dan S.,14/07/2022,Walmart,"Walmart pretends they have no responsibility for their ""marketplace"" items in their on-line store, unlike Amazon, and fraudulent vendors can appear credible because the payee is Walmart. Joybuy is one such fraudulent vendor with more 1-star than 5-star reviews, and Walmart takes your money for Joybuy and supplies no email or contact information. Avoid any ""marketplace"" item on Walmart.com -- Walmart colludes with scammers, and you'll have to contest charges via your credit card company."
3341,40439,Rochaunda B,14/07/2022,Walmart,If I could give no stars I would Walmart stole my bet my healthy food and my son debit card money and they are not doing anything to fix the situation. Please donâ€™t order food or anything from Walmart.com you will do a lot better dealing with Amazon.com at least. They care about customers
3342,40440,Kamaria Hatten,14/07/2022,Walmart,"Well I got to the point I didnâ€™t like going inside Walmart store no more. So I found the Walmart app. I like it from the beginning and had two issues and they refunded my money back. So today I order some things for the house through the Walmart app. The delivery driver put my things on the porch, and I went outside to get my things. There is washing powder spill on my porch then I look in the bag there is washing powder waste inside the bag. Some of the washing powder got on my trash bag box. I donâ€™t have money to waste!!!! WTH!!!! I did started a return but I canceled it because I donâ€™t want to go inside Walmart. They donâ€™t have enough workers, they are out of something, canâ€™t get no help from associate, so these are the reasons I stop going. Iâ€™m going to delete my account. I will go to other stores myself!!!!"
3343,40441,harley may,14/07/2022,Walmart,PICK UP IS AWEFUL! THIS IS THE WORST WALMART CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! DISGUSTING ðŸ¤¢ START HIRING WORKERS THAT WANT TO WORK AND DO THEIR JOBS CORRECTLY.

3345,40443,John,14/07/2022,Walmart,"I needed a flea and tick collar for my dog. Walmart has them locked up in a case. For over 30 minutes I asked all employees who walked by and even went to ask other employees to announce that I need the case to be opened over the intercom. It was announced that a customer needed help in the pet department. NO BODY CAME. Finally, a manager who was just coming in for her shift, who had a key, opened it for me. I complained to her about the amount of time it had been that I was waiting and she said "" Don't blame me...I just got here"". Walmart is probably the worst place in the world for customer service. It took even longer the last time I needed to get some paint mixed up."
3346,40444,Steve Abrego,14/07/2022,Walmart,I got the worst service ever I work retail but this was bad I waited almost a hour to get help even after talking to associates and the manager just to get something out if the liquor department two outer customers just left in disabled I walked there I use a walker just to get there I wasn't leaving till I got what I wanted it takes to much just to get there thay don't care if your disability they just look the other way.i haven't been there in a few in a while wont be going back any time soon.  .
3347,47061,Tonia George,15/07/2018,Walmart,"I feel like Wal-Mart isn't an easy store to walk into , go to the same spot to find your items and get out. I really don't like having to walk all over the store for 1 thing."
3348,44850,Chad Maxwell,15/07/2020,Walmart,I ordered a 7 piece set of welding caps. They sent me 1 cap. They care so little for their customers or their own integrity. Old man Walton is probably rolling over in his grave
3349,44851,Ken,15/07/2020,Walmart,"I was already pretty fed up with Walmart as a business but unfortunately I felt that I had little choice about buying most of my local necessities from them. As of next week they have gone no mask no service and for me this is the final straw! Neither I nor any member of my family will ever set foot in that business again, nor do any online purchases from them! I sincerely hope they go out of business!"
3350,44852,Laurel Anne,15/07/2020,Walmart,"Walmart was reliable and had just about all I wanted, especially during the stay at home shopping."
3351,44853,Nataly Hemaya,15/07/2020,Walmart,"The customer service is bad ! I have never had this problem before but coming here today it was so bad, asking simple questions and getting rude responses. This isnâ€™t with all the employees but we asked about 3 of them and they were extremely rude !"
3352,44854,Raven S,15/07/2020,Walmart,"Marana Arizona store has closed all but one entrance, under the guise of ensuring compliance with face masks. But they weren't even asking anyone to mask, and many weren't. So, if they aren't complying with the mask order anyway, why are they funneling everyone to one area for entry and exit, making PHYSICAL distancing next to impossible? It's as if they are trying to spread the virus."
3353,44855,David Grubbs,15/07/2020,Walmart,"We ordered a mattress at walmart.com to be pickup at a local Walmart. The seven foot long item was â€œlostâ€ for three weeks. It showed up after all - with a six inch hole in it. Returned within minutes of pickup, a replacement was promptly reordered by helpful staff. The second mattress was â€œshippedâ€ according to tracking, only to be â€œdelayedâ€ and, after three more weeks, â€œlostâ€ entirely. The staff could not reorder a second time at the original price. We cancelled.  The customer service staff were professional and helpful. They must have read Sam Waltonâ€™s book â€œMade in America: My Story.â€ Current management probably hasnâ€™t."

3355,44858,Karen,15/07/2020,Walmart,I ordered groceries for the first time the bread was a week expired. They substituted items that were 4 times higher in price. Not worth the fees for delivery. Will never order online.
3356,44859,Rajeev Jog,15/07/2020,Walmart,Incredibly incompetent. Their IT folk simply can't understand that sometimes one needs to be able to change an email address on an account. I was told flat out that the only way to do this would be to close the account and lose all my saved order history etc. RIDICULOUS!!!  Even though my account shows my email as 'unverified' but my phone number is 'verified'. So for security then can always send me a code there.  DUH. Walmart you will never catch up with Amazon.
3357,44860,T,15/07/2020,Walmart,Dear Walmart please fix the EBT check out some of us would like to use it.
3358,44861,khushbu modi,15/07/2020,Walmart,Not satisfied.very frustrating service. Tried call more than 7 times and every time tape is going on and than when I press 0 for customer service to speak with nobody was on the other end and phone was disconnected. After 7 attempt I called again and finally get chance to speak with representatives whose name is Vanessa and she do not wants to really help me. I did not finish with my issue yet and she mention me â€œthank you for calling Walmartâ€ ridiculous and horrible service. Do not use Walmart rewards because if you have any issue they are not there to help you out. Very bad and poor service.

Top loosened & spilled contents on other items. Toilet paper, canned items, olive oil, sponges, sea salt, every item in box were covered in bleach. Picked up box to transfer inside & bleach, which had soaked shipping box was now on my clothes. Immediately washed, but to no avail, ruined jeans & dark blue top. Canned goods were salvaged, but labels disintegrated, most of toilet tissue trashed, ouch! Please pay more attention to sealing for shipping. Thaxâ€¦"
3362,42884,Cindy Jolley,15/07/2021,Walmart,"Iâ€™ll give it a 3. It can be convenient. One problem I have is the check out. There have been multiple times that I think that I have checked out just to find that my order didnâ€™t go through. I have driven to pick up my order to find out that it didnâ€™t go through. You have to remember that even when you check out they continue to show you items they think you might want. Once I click check out I think that I have checked out. And I wish it would be that straight forward. But it is not. The other problem I have is they always want you to rate the driver, as if you were in the vehicle with them. I really donâ€™t know how theyâ€™re driving because Iâ€™m not in the car with them. And they automatically will charge you a seven dollar tip unless you state otherwise. I would rather tip after I receive my groceries not before. when I signed up and paid for $99 I thought that was the end of it. I thought it would be a service provided by Walmart not that it would be an additional fee for the deliveries. I guess I donâ€™t tip the mail delivery or UPS, or FedEx or the cashier at the checkout I thought that it would be like that. But whatever the case, I prefer to tip after I receive a service not before."

Asked for refund in phoncon with Walmart customer service (WCS). WCS turns over the return of funds to its outside vendor, and will no longer communicate with us. You guessed it, the outside vendor is equally incompetent. This fiasco has been ongoing for 2-1/2 months plus...."
3365,40432,Robin Stephenson,15/07/2022,Walmart,"I recently tried the Express Delivery option at Walmart, where you order online and Walmart employees do the shopping for you. It was a wonderful experience. The app is easy to shop on, the order was correct and the employee that brought my order out to me was friendly, professional and had a very upbeat attitude. I would highly recommend the Express Delivery option at the Big Spring TX Walmart."
3366,40433,Anne K,15/07/2022,Walmart,"Earlier today, my daughter went to the Walmart in Raleigh NC to buy a patio set and could not get anyone to help her get it off the shelf, to the checkout and into her car. Later that day, I went to the Walmart located on Kildaire Farm Road in Cary, NC to see if I could get that patio set for her. I regret that I did not get any names, but the one lady was OP #008337, if that helps. She was the one that rang up the sale. When asked if she could help me buy this item, she stepped up and found an older gentlemen to try and help. Well, due to the way the stock was arranged, he was a little too older and unable to handle the task himself. The lady then went about to find someone else who could help. Thankfully, she managed to find a young man who probably was the biggest guy in the store, and he easily obtained the patio set I wanted and set it up on the cart for the older gent to finish up the sale and load into my vehicle with some additional assistance. I just wanted to publicly say thank you to those three associates to went out of their way to make sure I was able to buy the item I wanted and have a good experience while doing so."
3367,40434,R S,15/07/2022,Walmart,"LOUSY!!! My item was to be delivered today. It is now 9;34pm and latest tracking shows it stuck in a Westhampton NJ processing facility. Do NOT trust Walmart 's shipping promises. LOUSY, late, lying and liable."
3368,40435,Brandon,15/07/2022,Walmart,When ordering online they won't honor something you paid for and cancel it. So if you think there is a deal don't bother buying it because they will cancel the order and raise the price of the product.. shop at Amazon.

My local store is also the most unorganized and dirtiest I've ever seen and it's a newer store less than 10 years old."

3373,46688,Brenda Ehmann,16/07/2019,Walmart,Walmart in Columbus has the lowest prices of foods in the area but the quality is not the best when youâ€™re looking for fresh meats and fresh fruits. There are other grocery stores that offer those items for the same price and better condition. The lines in Walmart are ridiculous! No cashiers are ever available! They only have one or two lines open with a cashier available. Self cashier register is lined up backed up! Employees are walking around like they donâ€™t have anything to do! Customers are angry and start leaving their carts with food in them because they canâ€™t stand in the long lines anymore. Some go and ask for help for another cashier and get told thereâ€™s nothing they can do about it! No even the managers jump on the cash register! Iâ€™ve never seen a place so disorganized in my life! All these chiefs and no Indians!

3381,44847,nalin prabodha (savage vlogs),16/07/2020,Walmart,"There are many reasons which prompted me to write this review. Out of many bad experiences encountered, there were two incidences at Walmart Store 3162, 80 Buchanan Drive, PE, unfortunately, the second one just after the first. I am a regular customer at the said store and my normal monthly spending exceeding CAD 1500. I was appalled by the way the checkout staffs' treatment directed at certain customers. It seems that they have been instructed to apply the ""Walmart 3 meter rule"", only for certain customers. I was saddened to see that the caucasian person in front of me greeted and just frowned at when I reached for check out. Me being a visible minority found this disturbing and racist. I believe this is not what Canada and Walmart stand for. I did once confront an agent she said and I quote, ""I am having a bad day"". Well, it seems to be funny she just started to have her bad day after I reached there. Then she was mocking me by repeated saying Good morning! How are you?. Then yesterday was a similar incident despite being the first to greet the staff with a friendly "" Good morning"" the person didn't even bother to reply back. It is they who should be greeting the customers first. Unfortunately, I don't have the receipt for the incident the week earlier but I have the TC# 0712 0162 2720 4521 8142 for yesterday. I find this behavior to be common among the new recruits from the same visible minority. Either it is the recruitment of staff by people unqualified or Walmart has decided to do away with their customer-friendly 3-meter rule."
3382,44848,Shawn Burch,16/07/2020,Walmart,Shop Amazon. 1) no mask required 2) you check yourself out at home 3)no long lines with 200 people and one associate at register
3383,44849,cynthia Christensen,16/07/2020,Walmart,F@#$ walmart! Nobody works! Take your facemask and shove it!
3384,42880,carol,16/07/2021,Walmart,other than the lllooonnnggg lines walmart has a great selection more than any store and I visit them all during the week. However i've noticed she shelves are empty and i have to return at a later date.
3385,42881,Cheyan Teague,16/07/2021,Walmart,"I was treated like a terrorist and dehumanized for a sickness I DONT EVEN HAVE.  I am vaccinated. I wore a mask. Everything I touched, I bought. I remained 6 feet away from everyone. My hands were sanitized all the way up to my elbows. I was prepared and cautious, although I AM NOT SICK.  I was there getting meds, Power-Aid, aid and soup for a sick family member.  When a manager found out, she put my bag ON THE GROUND, put her hands in the air, and stepped away. Then she continued to humiliate me by telling me how I put them all in danger. That I should know better. And that BECAUSE OF ME THEY HAVE TO CLEAN.  To make it worse, when other customers walked by, she put her finger up AT ME, her way of telling me to shut up, then continued to grill me AFTER they walked away. She acted like I had a weapon. Like I was going to attack her. I was silent most of the time, because I was so shocked at how this ""Manager"" was acting. I am never oging back. Not after that humiliation."
3386,42882,Terry Trinity Towers,16/07/2021,Walmart,"Horrible. Never again.  Normally, I get delivery through Instacart, but Walmart was offering a $25.00 off voucher when you make your first order and free delivery above $35 so I thought I'd give it a shot.  Big Mistake...  It took several tries to get the voucher to work. Once it did I placed my order. When I got to delivery I could no longer get free delivery, but they wanted $13.50 much more than Instacart would have charged. Since I had the voucher, I decide to proceed and just curbside pickup.  Fifteen minutes after the order was placed, I decided I wanted to add a bag of cat food to the order. After a fair amount of fussing I managed to add it, but the website then removed the voucher since the modification made it a second order so I apparently I was no longer eligible to receive the $25.00 off!?!?!?  So I called the support. They said.. Oooops system error. Nothing we can do about it but how about we give you a voucher for $25.00 off the next order. I said no. Cancel the entire thing.  Apparently, you can't just cancel an order. I talked to someone one the phone TWICE and online chat TWICE nothing was achieved. Just a ""Nothing we can do""  So, I went to Walmart at the pickup time. One of the items a $30.00 bag of dog food was unavailable. They claim I wasn't charged, but my bank account states otherwise.  It's now been 8 hours since this nonsense has started and the order is now in pending return status whatever TF that means and no money has been returned to my account.  So not only do I not have the items, but I'm currently out $115.36.  NEVER AGAIN. STAY FAR AWAY. If you need delivery pay the extra and get Instacart where you actually get good customer service and can modify/cancel your order at any time without penalties."

They need to be called on the carpet about this. This was in Albany, Oregon they are the worst, Walmarts reputation is real bad,"
3389,40499,RF,16/07/2022,Walmart,I received an order about 2 weeks late & mentioned it in my review to them along with the fact that I did not believe the item I purchased was authentic (as it was advertised) but it will still do the job I need it to do. They offered me a $10.00 discount... BUT ONLY if I spend at least $50.00 with them online... They stated in their email that this was to make it up to me... What do you think?
3390,47283,Joy Graham,17/07/2016,Walmart,I ordered 2 items 2 weeks ago and still haven't received them. I have never had this problem before. They were books. I can't believe its taking this long.

Get the law involved?

Tracked package on FedEx site, and it stated the label was created, but the package was never taken to their facility. I contacted customer service, and they said they tried to reorder the weights but they were out of stock. Why would they have to reorder them when I had already purchased them? The rep said all she could do is refund my money. Waited 3 weeks for nothing! P.S. This was not COVID related. It was due to people being inept."

So, they gave me a 10% discount and said they will replace it and be delivered by July 17. I again waited for sometime and when I checked on July 14, I saw similar pattern there were no information on FedEx so I called them and they assured that I will get by EOD on July 17. I didn't get and there was no any update in FedEx, so when I called them the customer service said that the best they can do is cancel my order and for the issues they will give me $ 10 promo code and that was not right. He transferred me to supervisor Ana S. who was rude and she simply said that the only solution is cancel and take $ 10 promo code she will provide and without much conversation she cancelled my order. I just told her to keep $ 10.  Next, i called the customer service and after much negotiation they gave me 20% off my next order. Which was nice, but I am very frustrated and depressed about how you guys handled my order. I will never order online and will not recommend my friends and family. Ana S. though I chatted was rude, she called herself supervisor and didn't even consider my feelings. I understand Covid and system issues, but same mistake twice and not alerting when I called two days before about the order is not acceptable. You guys can't compete with Amazon if you can't fulfill order and do same mistake twice and have Ana S. as a supervisor."
3400,44816,Hina Hassan,17/07/2020,Walmart,worst ppl to deal with for any kind of returns. they would right away turn you away discourage you for any return even if you buy online ask you zillion questions and if you open an item to check it theyd never refund you while others like bestbuy/amazon/staples etc etc happily refund you. i detest walmart and i'd never go there.

After months of trying, and 3 different delivery companies, No such luck or record of these attempts.

I was told to go home and wait until Walmart notified me it was ready, when I called to inquire, I was told it would not be ready for at least 48 hours because they were 'checking my financials for my protection. The payments had already cleared my bank, I have been doing the pick-up order for 18 months. They have 3 different debit cards on file. Explain this to me while i snack on... what?"

3423,42876,Kristen,17/07/2021,Walmart,"Absolutely horrible experience with Walmart.com. I ordered a table for $220.93. It was delivered and missing parts to put together. Called Walmart.com they sent a new table to me and the understanding was to take the parts needed and FedEx would pick up 2 days later. I received the table called Walmart.com back and inquired about not receiving a shipping label. The agent notified me itâ€™s digital and I donâ€™t need one. It didnâ€™t seem right so I asked again and was told the same thing. Sat the package outside. FedEx came to pick it up and knocked on my door and stated it didnâ€™t have a label. I told the guy what the agent assured me. He went to the car came back and said he will take the package. Package left a month ago. Today I receive a charge for the second table. Called customer service and agent# K0W05M3 did not care even a little bit about my concern. After explaining what happened she told me there is nothing she can do, she told me I defiantly received a label. (Checked emails no label EVER EMAILED) I asked for a supervisor and she refused to get me to one. She said I need to call FedEx. Called FedEx and they stated I need to call Walmart. Someone dropped the ball at Walmart.com customer service and is attempting to make me pay the price for a table I sent back. Issue still unresolved. I plan on contacting the BBB, my lawyer, and the corporate office because I am an honest person and to be talked to as if I am running a scam for $200 or that I did not follow instructions is ridiculous. The time, effort, and research I have put in just to resolve my issue is unreal. I will NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER THING FROM WALMART.COM.... who doesnâ€™t need a return slip when making a return?? I knew it sounded weird, told the agent it sounded weird, and was advised that is the process."
3424,42877,Pauly Paul,17/07/2021,Walmart,Walmart money card is the biggest scam ever. Pray on poor people and take their money. Walmart should be ashamed of themselves. Pushing that money card to steal and lie about your money CANCEL WALMART. BBB EVEN THINKS SO!!!

Walmart employees treat customers like were all thieves . The greeters are no longer greeting. They spend more time chit chatting with the paid police officer whose suppose to be doing security. Its a shame so much work walmart family has done to make walmart what it is today and employees tearing it down. They wouldnt honor a manufacturer warranty and kept my microwave and there never is managers there just team leader..no leadership"

No wonder, you don't have employees because everyone has to check themselves out. I asked about cucumbers and was told if it's not over there we don't have it. Great, but as I'm pushing my buggy away I spot the cucumbers that they didn't have. I mean why would the employee help a customer, they don't have to do anything else but watch us scan our own groceries."

3431,46680,Quinn Rickert,18/07/2019,Walmart,"WARNING! Some Walmart stores perform ILLEGAL receipt checks after you have already bought the product and are leaving the store. It is illegal for Walmart to perform receipt checks this way, because they are assuming that everyone is stealing something. When you purchase a product it is your property, they have no business checking your receipt and looking through your stuff. Stay far away from Walmart and other stores that perform these illegal receipt checks."
3432,46681,Ziggy Doom,18/07/2019,Walmart,I could write a book about all the Walmart horror stories but I'll just share my latest ordeal.I ordered a tv and they used the cheapest and worst shipping company in the world (Estes) to deliver it to me. The tv came broken. They sent the replacement tv with once again the cheapest and worst shipping company in the world and it came missing an entire tv leg. Stay FAR away from Walmart.com and use Amazon.com instead.

Was to receive it 7/17/20 and had to be home for signature. Waited all day no box spring. Looked on Fedex tracking it stated DELAYED. Called Walmart (INDIA) was told my order was not coming! Had a hard time understanding why? Was asked if I wanted to reorder or cancel and receive a refund. I opted for a refund but of course they couldn't process it because of error. Called back that afternoon and got a credit for the boxspring but not the tax??? Was asked would a $10.00 gift card be ok instead of the tax ($8.40). What???? Never again! Walmart you'll never compete against Amazon. Will never order from Walmart.com again!

3443,36195,LindseyAlayne,18/07/2018,Amazon Go,"Fun experience, prices are typical for the area Before you go, download the Amazon Go app! When you get to the store, you open your app, scan it as you walk in (or scan for each person in your group, my kids loved this) and then SHOP! When you walk out it ""knows"" what you bough and charges you! It's a fun experience, it's super convenient and all the food we got was really fresh and tasty. Most of what is stocked are grab and go snacks or small meals. My kids like everything they got and so did I. We went back again the next day and had another great experience. I loved the fresh salads!"
3444,42866,Bob,18/07/2021,Walmart,"Their website is horrible. Logged in as requested, searched for the item I wanted and it was available for pickup only at the store. Clicked checkout and it had changed the location to one 50 miles away. Fortunately, I caught that and changed it back to my local store. At the time there were 4 available and this was not a fast moving item. It was in my cart, I went to check out, typed in all the information including CC info, address, etc. and pressed pay now. It hesitated for a few seconds and then told me that they were sorry, but the item that they showed as in stock 30 seconds before wasn't in stock, but they'd gladly put it in the queue for a later purchase sometime in the future. I removed it from the future purchases and will go elsewhere. So there are a couple of things. The website randomly changes your location and they apparently have no control over their inventory. So not only did they not get a $150 sale, I was angry and will only look at Walmart's online 'shopping' as a very last resort. As big as they are and if they want to compete with Amazon, they really need to get their act together, because they look like a bunch of amateurs."
3445,42867,Peter Hunt,18/07/2021,Walmart,"The delivery or pickup part of the website continually erased more than 30 items I'd chosen four times, wasting my time and energy. Also, the Wallet part asks for a P.I.N. and shows 4 lines on which to enter it. After entering the first number, 11 additional lines appear and prevent one from completing that task.  All together, I wasted about 4 hours trying to arrange for groceries to be delivered and by being blown-off by the Deli Department worker that was the only person to answer the phone after I'd called many times. In the end, he put me on hold and left me there for 15 minutes and did not answer the two times I called him back."
3446,42868,Valerie Leavitt,18/07/2021,Walmart,Walmart is getting so ridiculous 1 cashier open and the line is 3 miles back and the others is self checkout but you can only pay with card. This is why I don't come here anymore and honestly you are going to loose a lot of customers because of this. But corporate don't care as long as they get that Ole mighty dollar.
3447,42869,AnnaMarie Chavez,18/07/2021,Walmart,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced since Walmart opened. It's bad enough that we have to scan and bag our own groceries and items but now we have to go get our own assistance? I was in the pet Department and there was an associate right in the department and he refused to go get me assistance so that I can get a flea collar which was in the case. Couldn't believe it. Even after I told him you're a customer service sales person, you're going to tell me to go get help from someone else when you're supposed to be the one to help me? Wow that's all I can say is wow worst experience ever. His name is Noah and he does no justice to the name!"
3448,42870,R. Mc,18/07/2021,Walmart,This is awful. Again I was missing items. Now my chicken was not in the order. They told me I have to COME all the way back in to either get another one or refunded. The reason I do this is for the convenience and to save time. A few weeks ago it was my wraps----they were open an then stuffed back in the pkg. I called and NEVER GOT A RESPONSE. From now on I am going to Hannafords 543-1681 or Shaws 863-4173 pick up. This letter is also going to be a review on Walmart's page.
3449,42871,Mindy Messer,18/07/2021,Walmart,Problems with delivery. Groceries and regular products. They use fedex for a lot of their shipping and theyâ€™ve lost my stuff. They also keep the refrigerated groceries out for long periods of time.
3450,40426,Marley,18/07/2022,Walmart,"Well this was an experience that will have me never purchasing anything from Walmart ever again. The customer service was absolutely atrocious. They lost my item, were unhelpful and inconsistent in their approach to helping me find it or take next steps, left me voicemails I couldn't understand, told me I could refund it over the phone, but when I was busy and couldn't do it right then, suddenly I couldn't do it over the phone a day later. Absolutely disgusted with the ""service"" I received. I urge you, if you're looking for a specific product and other stores have it, GO WITH THE OTHER STORES. Walmart does not care about you or your satisfaction. Satisfaction guaranteed is such a joke. Not to mention, when I did finally receive the package (a tent) magically, a week after I needed it, the tent was garbage quality. Then they sent me an email asking me to submit a review on their website. I jumped at the opportunity only for them to send me an email saying my review had been rejected, because, get this, it was ""directing business away"". Uh, yeah. So don't trust a single review on Walmart's website as they do not allow people to say the truth, especially if it's negative."
3451,47282,Howard Paul Shore,19/07/2016,Walmart,"Tuesday, July 19, 2016  Back in earlier July of 2016, my 85 year old mother who is Permanently Disabled, including having a Prolapsed Bladder, Heart Condition and Low Circulation In Both Of Her Legs (Making Her Very Immobile With Her Walking) Had Just Bought A Package Of Their Great Value Pink Salmon 700g From The Walmart Location At: c/o Walmart Dufferin Mall Supercentre, 900 Dufferin Street, Toronto, Ontario Canada M6H 4A9 (416) 537-2561 And Had A Very Bad Experience!  First of all, Their Fish Had A Very Bad Odor!  It was So Disgustingly Strong that I could smell it outside of my mother's apartment!  Gross!  It Smelled Like A Dead Body To Be Quite Honest With You!  Secondly, when my mother cooked it and took her very first bite, she did NOT feel very well due to CRAMPING IN HER STOMACH and Immediately Stopped Eating Any More Of That Fish And Threw It Out!  Please NOTE: She could have gotten very sick from their fish if she kept on eating it and thankfully she was Smart Enough To Stop After Her Very First Bite!  Is This The Kind Of Garbage That Walmart Makes,Produces And Sells To The Public?  I would hope NOT, but that was Not My Mother's Experience and I am her Personal Witness in this Case as well!  For Your Information: I am now going to provide You with some vital details that I was able to retrieve from the package of Their Horrible, Disgusting Fish for your reference and further review.  Great Value Pink Salmon Skin-On Fillets 2 Fillets Wild Caught 700 g M5C-C-52677 Upc Code: 6 28915 24305 5 Best Before: 2018 FE 28   In My Complaint, I also provided Pictures Of The Front And Back Side Of The Package Of Fish for your reference and further review.  Sadly, the first response that I got came from a Mark in Customer Service who Purposely and Deliberately Misread My Letter and Changed Around All Of The Wording In My Letter to make it look like I was complaining about the Smell In One Of Their Stores which was a Lie because he just did Not Wish To Deal With My Mother's Complaint.  Can you believe it?  Yes, I do have that letter available to view upon request.  Furthermore, the latest response that I received came from Customer Service stating that they have transferred my case to their Escalations Department and will have an answer for me within 24 hours.  Well, we will wait and see.  For a Billion Dollar Company, I think that they Can Afford to have better staff to deal with in Customer Service and they Can Afford To Have A Much Faster Turnaround Time!  Thank you.  Sincerely yours,      Howard Paul Shore Angry And Upset Wal-Mart Canada Corp. Customer On Behalf Of Mrs. Helene Shore, Your Customer  /HPS"
3452,46675,Justin,19/07/2019,Walmart,Walmart. Com is complete garbage. Donâ€™t buy stuff online. Ordered a swingset and delivery was supposed to be 3 days. Then it got moved to the 6th day. Then moved to 10th then 11th. Then when we called for the fifth time they said they would call early the next week to tell us a delivery day in another week. Finally had enough and said we want money back and the said it would be put back on gift card after 5 business day. Complete ignorant company that gives false delivery dates. I do not recommend to anyone

Forgery is a serious accusation, I could have been arrested and facing a major Felony for something I did not do. !!!!!! My dr had my Rx for July sent to this place electronically and the pharmacist and pharmacy manager refused to fill it and Cancelled it for no legitimate reason !!!!! She caused me to NOT have any medication for July. This is not acceptable. I have no meds for this month. They do not know my medical history and to do this is so wrong!!!!! Do NOT fill your meds here or you might get accused of forgery and go to jail for something you didnâ€™t do !!!!!!"
3461,42855,Gunter Retterath,19/07/2021,Walmart,"First time Buyer cannot believe the ineffective Customer Service. Bought a PFD (Life Vest) on line and it was too small. Having been with Amazon for 10 years, I expected a similar return policy of getting a label from Walmart. I even offered to pay for the return shipping. No way, the best Walmart ""Customer Service""could do is to make this Senior drive 2 hours to the nearest Walmart. Unlike Amazon, Walmart is not interested to keep Customers. Third-Party Sellers on Walmart have no clear return policies and Walmart allows them to get away with unethical business practices. Walmart is a cruel joke when it comes to on-line purchases. Thank heaven there is Amazon."
3462,42857,Dr. V. P.,19/07/2021,Walmart,"I should have read the reviews prior to ordering through Wal Mart online. Did not receive the very expensive grill, even though the tracking system reflects the shipment arrived in Denver. Hmmm, so where is my grill? Customer service representatives- spoke with two of them and the shipper- all with lackadaisical and who cares attitude. Now, preparing to deal with waiting for the refund. It seems Wal Mart does not need online customers."
3463,42858,Kimberly Hernandez,19/07/2021,Walmart,I ordered two pinatas for a birthday party. The website stated they would arrive prior to this party. After shipment it stated arrival would be 2 days AFTER the party. When refund was requested it stated I had to wait for delivery of items and then 10 days after! Horrible service and depend on items needed within a specific timeframe.
3464,42859,Rich Estrada,19/07/2021,Walmart,They sold me a gaming headset and I bought the protection plan and itâ€™s not really a protection plan but an extended warranty basically so if itâ€™s something on there end is messed up theyâ€™ll cover it but if you lose a price or it breaks your on your ownâ€¦
3465,42860,Mr. S,19/07/2021,Walmart,Their website walmart.com used to be good now that they've updated it it's complete crap. They make it almost impossible for you to get delivery for stuff that you used to be able to order online because their stores don't deliver certain ways and if it's a small thing you need they won't ship it call and ask him about disabilities they don't care about disabled people the elderly or anybody that can't go to their store physically if you're not buying in bulk they won't ship it. They put an idiot in charge of whoever just changed the website it's junk now.
3466,42861,Walmartsucks,19/07/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a product in early June (approx 9th) during my order process the delivery date was June 23rd. Once I placed my order and made payment the delivery date changed to July 5th. I called for updates no less than 3 times because over the next few weeks the online tracking said it was sitting with a shipping label waiting to be picked up - in 3 weeks it never changed. Then, more than a week after my package was supposed to arrive, the cancelled my package on me BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T FIND IT. What kind of a mess is their shipping company?  When I asked why they cancelled it rather than expediting a new item to me (since it was THEIR FAULT) or even paying for a courier (I mean they only make BILLIONS a year) they wouldn't even reply. There are so many places to shop online, I used to spend a ton at WalMart - never again!!"

I asked a worker behind the counter and she said no registers open at this time. So I pointed at my full cart and told her you can keep it and walked out. It's appalling that the more prices go up the less the services afforded to consumers. I don't use self-checkouts anywhere becuz I don't get paid to do the corporations jobs.  I will arrange my hours and wait for Publix and Winn-Dixie to open at 7am. They have cashiers open everywhere!"
3469,42864,A.B.,19/07/2021,Walmart,Walmart Has One Of The Worse Track Records On Getting Things Delivered By The Merchants. They Told Me My Shipment Was Damaged & Returned My Money on Card.

I Will Never Order On Line Nothing From Them Ever Again or They Merchants!!!

3471,40417,Melissa Lewis,19/07/2022,Walmart,First time getting something delivered from Walmart and they messed up my order! I had ordered a crib and they delivered a patio set! The people delivering my order never knocked on my door to confirm delivery. I called customer service and they said it will take up to 3 days for someone to come get the wrong order. I am 9 months pregnant single and had this huge box to move off my porch to move it into my garage so no one steals it or the rain doesnâ€™t damage it! I have to wait 20 plus days to get my money back to order another crib! My baby comes in 28 days! The WORST experience I have ever had!! Never will I be ordering from Walmart again!
3472,40418,Roman's Reviews,19/07/2022,Walmart,"Walmart?... So much has already been said So I decided to rhyme this review instead Shopping here could make you a bit nervous It leaves a lot to be desired for given their poor customer service. I don't think they ever had proper training whatsoever, Their approach to customer satisfaction is like,.. whatever! Leave the store feeling appreciated?,.. Never! Being treated like you're a thief,.. Always & forever! Satisfied when returning an item?,.. Hardly ever! But check this out Economical prices is what our continuous shopping here is about And of course their variety Both sole reasons why they still get some notoriety. But stay away from the meat If you wanna remain on your feet.."
3473,40419,Chris,19/07/2022,Walmart,"I initially had a good experience with ordering online from Walmart.com, enough so to join Walmart+. After joining Walmart+ though is when all of the problems started racking up. Their return and refund policies were confusing, their store associates were bitter and malicious, purposefully opening or destroying my returns and openly spiting me. Their logistics was a nightmare, resulting in repeated deliveries of many items, sometimes even grocery items worth less than $0.25, many damaged items, and blamed me for ""returning"" too many items, when in fact their logistics system was so broken that they could not or were not even willing to take my brand-new returns to restock on their shelves Eventually, they deactivated my account, once again blaming me for breaking their ToS for too many returns. This occurred when I was no longer returning any more items, and occurred unexpectedly. Actually, they did so after I had purchased some large, expensive items, preventing me from returning them if they were faulty, which, of course, with their nightmarish logistics, some did come broken. I run a business and my purchasing runs into the thousands/month. Logistics and returns are a day-to-day part of life at such volume, and Walmart was completey unable to handle what their service promises to deliver. I use another service - that will not be named but starts with the letter ""A"" - with perfect ease and have never had any complaints from them. Their staff are polite and carefully package my mostly unopened, undamaged returns to resell later, probably as brand new items."
3474,40420,Ryuta,19/07/2022,Walmart,"I work two jobs and rarely have time to go shopping when I get home so I utilize the app a lot. I don't know if it's just the area that we live in or what, but the app is slowly becoming the bane of my existence. It was great at first, but now, every other order that I place for delivery is delayed. Delivery times are becoming less and less as well. I'm currently waiting on a delivery that I placed at 2:30 today. The only time that I was forced to take without having to pay $17 extra dollars for express, was 8-9 pm. I got a text at 8:30 letting me know that my items would, once again, be delayed. It is currently 9:30 pm and I'm now being told that some items aren't available. Yeah, of course they are, because you waited until NOW to start looking for them. Most of the groceries I ordered would now be put away at this hour. And even better, the only times that I can choose for tomorrow are either early in the morning or 3:00 pm. All of the others are for walmart + members only. I don't get to this side of town UNTIL 5:45 pm. I don't get home until 6 and then I have to work again straight after. My groceries will be sitting out in 90+ degree humidity for 3 hours, all because I don't have a stupid membership? Nice. I'm going to use another third party delivery service because I'm honestly sick of this. This is the third time in a row that I've had this happen."
3475,40421,Chris,19/07/2022,Walmart,"I placed an order online 5 days prior for in-store pickup at a location 45 minutes from my work because delivery option was not available. On my way there for my scheduled pickup time, I receive a text saying there has been a delay. No problem. I continue on since I'm on my way anyway. While I am there waiting, I receive another message saying the item is not in stock even though it apparently was when I placed the order. Well that's rather upsetting. The item, however, is in stock at another store an hour away, once again available for pickup but not delivery. I cannot waste my time driving all over the place to pick up this item. While there, I end up speaking with customer service on the phone asking if they can do me the courtesy of delivering the item to my home since it's someone in their business who dropped the ball. I was speaking in a measure tone explaining the inconvenience of this whole situation. The supervisor has the gall to start raising his voice and getting upset at me for a mistake THEY made, makes no effort to find a solution, and gives no apologies. Bulls**t company living up to it's awful reputation. My mistake for thinking it was a good idea to try and buy something from them. I've always liked Amazon better anyways whose customer service is *outstanding*."
3476,40422,Lori Mallory,19/07/2022,Walmart,"Walmart + is ridiculous! If I could give negative rating I would because the worst experiences of my life.

3480,46673,Melissa Young,20/07/2019,Walmart,"I had THE WORST experience at the Walmart on Broad St in Brooksville, FL!!!! I called around to all the local stores to get a flat screen tv they had on clearance & was told this particular location had some. I called and had someone pull one behind the counter for me and told them Iâ€™m on my way. He told me the price was marked normal price but they would take it up to customer service and price match! I drive 45 minutes there and get it up front and the customer service manager named Denise was SO RUDE & NASTY! She said itâ€™s $248....we canâ€™t give it to you for the $149 clearance price! Well I showed her the tv that was on the Walmart app which said the brand and the size and looked identical. She said nope you can either purchase this tv for $248 or leave but we are not price matching! I asked for a manager and she said â€œI am the managerâ€ so I asked for another manager! She gets Frances over there which was nicer but also refused to price match! Denise carts the tv and the tv mount I had back to the back behind electronics. I then ask for corporates number! They call the assistant manager and get them to come talk to me. We do some more research and the $248 tv was the ultra hd so the associate pulled the wrong one out to hold for me. So I said ok just get me the correct tv for $149! Then they say they donâ€™t have any! Well on the app it says they have 3 in stock! They still argue with me saying maybe I could get it somewhere else online but not there! So I add it to the cart through the app and pay for it and it clearly said pick up at their location! So at this point I already bought it so whereâ€™s the tv?! They search everywhere in the back and find an open box returned tv, it was missing the manual but they gave me $15 off which I tuned around and used on the 2 year protection plan and I also bought the $80 mount. They make me pay for the tv again and tell me to cancel my online order. I was there for 2 hours from 6:30-8:30pm!!!! To top it all off.....My car was hit in the parking lot and the car just took off! So now I spoke with Bob the store manager to look at the security cameras to find who did it and he said I have to file a police report and they have to request to see them. Now I have to pay my $500 deductible to fix my car!!!! Expensive trip to Walmart!!! I think Iâ€™ll stay away from there!!!!!!!!! I donâ€™t understand how Denise has a job there....she definitely does not know how to speak to a customer!!!!!! I Will Not being doing business at that location again!!!!!!"

They can't tell me what happened to my 2 chairs it's insane. In fact, I waited 1 month plus already. I know due to the crisis the demand is higher but, ehh tell me where my 2 chairs I've paid that already. I'm frustrated and not a happy camper at all. I never heard from them. NEVER AGAIN!!!"

I order from Amazon and they have third party sellers and never get my orders cancelled. Never again Walmart! Wonder what would happen if I went to their store and bought something?
3485,44789,Linda Rodriguez,20/07/2020,Walmart,I got my delivery today Your company put 2 laundry soap With 2 bag of chips and my barbecue potato sticks broke on top and was all over in the box with soap not good food with detergent
3486,44790,Brian Peterson,20/07/2020,Walmart,"We purchased 2 multi function sd card readers from them, one of them was defective, we had asked for a replacement and to purchase an additional unit since the failure ratio was at 50%. They said that they would contact the storefront, they never heard from them, and just refunded what we paid. They were courteous but didn't resolve the issue, a refund is not what we wanted."
3487,44791,Browneyed Luna,20/07/2020,Walmart,"I wish I could give them zero stars but thatâ€™s not possible. I started using their Pick Up grocery feature and once you put an order in, it pre-authorize charges yours credit card. The last few times Iâ€™ve used the Grocery Pick Up, they charge me my pre-authorization amount and my final amount. I also had a delivery item. Walmart emailed me a confirmation that it was delivered and charged my credit card for it but I never received the item. When I called Customer Service about this, all they could say was â€œCall your bank to refute the chargesâ€. Iâ€™ve called 4 times with issues in the last month. The customer service reps are also rude and completely useless, why is Walmart wasting their money paying them to sit there and be unhelpful? Do NOT use their service and if you do track the charges. Iâ€™m switching over to Fortinos for my groceries now, they are more expensive and their Pick Up has a minimal charge but itâ€™s worth it to avoid getting charged hundreds of dollars over your actual amount. Very poor experience and very dissatisfied."
3488,44792,*JethroBodine*,20/07/2020,Walmart,I canâ€™t say anything about the product or the price because I knew it before I ordered. I will say that they donâ€™t have a two day delivery no matter what time you purchase. I ordered tires for a customer because I am disabled and I have to make $200 a month because I donâ€™t get enough money for food and medication and doctors with Medicare and social security disability insurance. Today is the 7th day since ordering and I still donâ€™t have the tire and I lost money because I had the guy that mounts the tires here on the 3rd day as a safety measure in case they were late. Now I have lost $100 instead of making it so I have lost my food for August.
3489,44793,Jeremy Auld,20/07/2020,Walmart,Y'all need registers open and stop making machines card only not everyone uses cards waited 30 minutes to check out 4 items
3490,44794,Janis Altizer,20/07/2020,Walmart,"I will never order on line from Walmart My experience is zero! I will never order anything from them on line, ever. It was not disclosed you were buying from a third party. When I tried to return a hedge trimmer Walmart told me I would not be able to return it to Walmart they refused it and said I would have to return it to Limitedf Goods The website was not available and the phone was never answered. I paid for a hedge trimmer that worked for 15 minutes. Small Claims Court here I come!!!!!!!!!!!"
3491,44795,Donna West,20/07/2020,Walmart,Online orders are not being delivered by there Fedx carrier. If this doesnâ€™t change I will not be placing any order. It would be nice if we could choose our carrier at checkout.
3492,44796,Alisa Walker,20/07/2020,Walmart,Walmart new policy to require face masks on July 20th only feeding this hoax that face masks work. We have been shopping for months without them and had no outbreaks. The flu has been more damaging then COVID 19. This act of control will not be supported and I will no longer shop at WalMart. My money will go to their competitors. #banwalmart
3493,44797,Sherri Donovan,20/07/2020,Walmart,Loyal Walmart customer. Prior to Covid I was enjoying using shop from home and pick up at store. Since Covid the service is Worthless! IF I am lucky enough to secure a time slot for Pick up at my Freehold or Howell NJ store...I place order and within minutes get an email that half of my order is Out of Stock! I physically go into store and am magically able to get items I was told Out of Stock. Today was my last order! I'm taking my business elsewhere I'm fed up with the Covid Excuses!
3494,44798,Jeff D,20/07/2020,Walmart,I give you 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. You can stick your brainwashed mask order and shove it into your keester. I will be happy to shop at your competitors.
3495,36227,Samuel M.,20/07/2021,Amazon Go,Quick in and out trip. What else can you ask for. I went in late so some items were out of stock. It was rush hour when everyone is out.
3496,42849,Sueann Scarborough,20/07/2021,Walmart,I ordered a childâ€™s penguin back pack and towel.. the towel wasnâ€™t a towel but an expensive hand towel wth? $16.99 for a penguin hand towel Iâ€™m very disappointed also it took 30 DAYS to get it... the expensive penguin back back dosent hold much maybe childâ€™s sunglasses and a juice box lol also came with a long rope which was a childâ€™s LEASH .. with delivery taking forever and so disappointed in the size Iâ€™ll never order from Walmart ever again!
3497,42850,Proctor Paul,20/07/2021,Walmart,they will cancel your orders sometimes when you try to ship to your home but overall the products are authentic.
3498,42851,EDDIE KAYNE,20/07/2021,Walmart,I purchased tires on the 11th of July. Initially the tires were supposed to be available on the 13th then it was the 20th then the 19th of July. Needless to say I haven't received the tires after being told and seeing on the app they were being processed in store. Now I'm receiving a message that states it's delayed. I'm done with Walmart and advise don't purchase online with them.
3499,42852,Howard Jones,20/07/2021,Walmart,Ordered 2 cases of can dog food. TO be received yesterday I got 2 6 packs. Called today said it was all taken want care of. Then I receive only another 6 pack. People can't even count and they want $15 an hour
3500,42853,Bobby McDonald,20/07/2021,Walmart,I ordered 2 recliners 15 days ago they were supposed to be here on the 14th it is know the 19 the and they went from Oklahoma to north Carolina and I live in Arkansas Walmart is such a blankety company they just expect you to wait forever and there excuses are o it's a pandemic if the whole country is getting cut off of unemployment and having to go back to work why can't I get my order they darn sure made all the money thru the pandemic and they don't offer any discounts when your order is a 2 weeks late Walmart is china sellouts
3501,42856,Patti Masters,20/07/2021,Walmart,"This is based on the last 3 orders- I order online through Walmart.com and get a delivery date. Then they send out some food delivery service to dump the items on my doorstep the very same day while I am out of town. No packaging, just stuff dumped on a doorstep. Iâ€™ve never ordered through delivery, just through the shipping area. I have spoken with customer service 3 times, and they guaranteed it wonâ€™t happen againâ€¦. But of course it does. So I get to waste time with customer service people, refunds, and have to go buy my items elsewhere. Really bad customer service with this site - what is with them substituting? If I didnâ€™t order it- donâ€™t send it. If you donâ€™t have it- donâ€™t put it on your site. Some employee doesnâ€™t get to decide what I want. Is that employee going to take the time and gas to return this unwanted item? Nice job putting out your customers Walmart. Iâ€™m done with them. Deliver on or after the date stated, not 2 days before! And bring what I ordered NOT what you decided I should have instead!"
3502,40414,Laura Giese,20/07/2022,Walmart,"I received an email that I had ordered a bodycam from Walmart.com. I had not. I called and Walmart said the order was cancelled. The next email I got said that the bodycam had shipped. The shipment I received included a padded envelope with a blank sheet of paper. Initially, Walmart said they would refund the money if I waited until July 11. I waited. Then they said there was nothing they could do. Walmart took the money out of my account, I believe it is their responsibility to replace it, given the correspondence came from Walmart and I paid Walmart. From what I can see, Walmart is the scammer. I am urging everyone I know to NEVER USE WALMART.COM AGAIN,"
3503,40415,Carla Isenhower,20/07/2022,Walmart,"I ordered 5 items online. The first delivery arrived wrapped up in a plastic check-out bag, and of the two items supposedly in the bag, only one was present. Two other items arrived later (in a box), but one of the items was not what I ordered. I'm done with Walmart. Back to Amazon."
3504,40416,Darnold,20/07/2022,Walmart,"I wrote a review for ""Equate Earloop Face Masks, Blue, 25 Count"". I included a photo showing the very small earloops on the Equate mask in comparison with the masks I got elsewhere. Walmart let my review post but did not post my picture. My picture was well within their specifications for posting. So, i tried to do another review with the picture and it will not post. Not sure if that is because I already reviewed the product or not."
3505,40425,Leah Palmer,20/07/2022,Walmart,"My problem is that I shopped online on July 14th 2022 and had a pickup scheduled for the afternoon. When I went to pick up my groceries there were items in my order that were supposed to be canceled. The young man that helped me stated that their computers had gone down that morning and so that's how the items probably made it into my order. I refused to take those items that I had canceled and I did not touch them. I made him take them back into the store. I watched as he deleted those items from my order on his handheld computer. I thanked him and left. I called my bank on 07/18/2022 because Walmart owes me $26.24 for the cancelled items in my order. The bank states that the Walmart transaction from the 14th is still pending because Walmart hasn't taken their money yet. Since when does Walmart give you free food or merchandise?! I've been shopping WM online for years and every single time my groceries were paid for when I picked them up. So why not now? I called Customer service to find out. The first one was a lady who I could not communicate with. No matter how hard I tried, She couldn't answer my question. I asked to speak with someone else and she stated that she couldn't do that. I informed her that I was going to hang up then. I was upset. I didn't understand how such a simple question couldn't be answered. A while later I tried again. Sometime between 5:30-5:45 p.m. CST on July 18th, 2022, when I called I was connected with a man whose name I don't know because he had a thick accent and I didn't understand him when he said his name. I didn't bother to ask for it again because I just wanted to explain my problem and get it resolved. He said in order for him to assist me, I would need to download an app called ""Quicksupport"". I asked him what it was and how it was going to help. He said it is a tool CS reps use that allows them to see what I see. Meaning the Walmart app. So I said ok. I downloaded the app and when I opened it, he walked me through the set up and before I knew what was happening, he took control of my phone! He didn't ask me for permission, he didn't tell me that he was going to do that. I was extremely upset. He was searching through my phone and I asked him what he was looking for. He asked me what the name of my bank was. I asked him why he needed that information. He said it would help him identify the transaction. I told him my bank name and he said ""You don't have the bank app here, I'll just download it."" Then he told me he wanted me to sign into my bank account so he could see the pending transactions. I said, ""Hell no I'm not!"" He kept assuring me that he wouldn't be able to see my account or routing numbers or anything personal. What a crock! By now I was really freaking out and I told him that I was not comfortable with ANY of this! I tried to hang up several times but he kept controlling my phone and wouldn't let me hang up so I shut my phone off to disconnect the call. I'm shocked and scared. I googled Walmart Corporate and sent them an email."
3506,47056,Kathleen Todd,21/07/2018,Walmart,"They are usually great and nice, sometimes not so lucky but will still shop there."
3507,46668,Nathan J,21/07/2019,Walmart,"I honestly like shopping at Walmart, who doesnt??"
3508,46669,Linda Gingerich,21/07/2019,Walmart,"Why does Walmart think I want to scan and bag my own groceries? I already finished an 8 hour day at work. Why does Walmart think that I want to put another individual out of work? I pick out my own fresh fruits, vegetables and meats. Why does Walmart think I would leave that to a stranger. Why does Walmart think that the ""reserved for pickup"" parking is empty? What is Walmart thinking?"
3509,46670,customer,21/07/2019,Walmart,I worked for Walmart for seven years before I was let go for no reason at all.Its sad but they sure dont know how to treat their employees more less their customers.
3510,46671,Amy Morita,21/07/2019,Walmart,I purchased an iPad Pro from Walmart online which was advertised as a new iPad well did not say refurbished or used. When it arrived it was used in poor packaging and used non standard power cords. So I returned it to the store. Well Walmart told me that this was purchased from another Party (wombat) did not know this my charge card transaction was Walmart So they told me I have to return the iPad to that vendor then I could have a refund. This is ridiculous I will never shop at Walmart again. I suggest everyone boycott this store they are becoming very shady!!!
3511,46672,Tim Hughes,21/07/2019,Walmart,"Not sure if all Walmarts are doing this, but the one in my town (Ohio) are checking your bags as if everyone shopping there is stealing. If you dont have your receipt from checkout, the ""greeters"" at the door are rude and disrespectful. I am a law abiding tax paying citizen. I dont appreciate being treated like a thief. I'll be going to our local supermarkets now."
3512,36382,Ted C.,21/07/2018,Amazon Go,Really cool place and weird at the same time! Big brother watching you all the time! It's the store of the future.
3513,36436,Megan K.,21/07/2018,Amazon Go,Amazon Go is a cool place. They are a bit over priced... $3.79 for a croissant...but it was still good. The technology is pretty cool so you should check it out if your stopping by. They don't have that many options...I was expecting something a bit bigger. They don't have anywhere for you to sit inside so I went to starbucks and got a coffee.
3514,36246,Vy P.,21/07/2019,Amazon Go,"This was a WILD experience. I can see why a ton of tourists come here because this place seems almost too futuristic and unreal.  This is essentially a small grocery shop - so small that it's basically one of those grab and go places. A lot of things in here are single meals or bags of snacks/chips.  You literally scan your app, walk in, walk around, grab what you want, and walk out.  I think it's safe to say that MOST (not all... some people are used to this) people in here are experiencing it for the first time. People are excited - vlogging, talking to their family or friends - when walking around and it's just fun!"
3515,36204,M D.,21/07/2022,Amazon Go,"One of the worst stores in the country! They have a lot of issues now. They used to be good when they first started, but amazon has gone down the tubes. The customer service is the worst! Whether trying to solve a problem online, chat, call, or email, they just do not get it. Most of the agents/customer service do not read, know, or understand English well so can never help to solve a problem. I have reached my break point with them and will stop using amazon or going here anymore. There are other stores much better that have much better customer service and stand behind their products they sell better than amazon. Very bad experience with amazon lately, they used to be good, but no longer, just horrible!"
3516,42839,Ashley Campbell,21/07/2021,Walmart,Was hung up on twice and contacted Walmart customer service 5 times and everyone gave me the run around kept telling me there was nothing to be done about the fact that I never received my order that it was delivered to the wrong place no where near my house that I was at all day..... And was told I could write a letter to corporate if I wanted too
3517,42840,Frank Kern,21/07/2021,Walmart,Ordered a product and they shipped to wrong store after I changed it on website. Called customer service got some dude in India who couldn't even say Florida right let alone spell it. I asked for someone in united States for customer service and was told walmart has no customer service for walmart.com in America. How can a company who advertises buy American in their stores not even offer customer service here?
3518,42841,Sonia Mullins,21/07/2021,Walmart,"Seems that Walmart is on a downward spiral. They never paid enough, leading to unhappy workers and now your lack of customer service is at rock bottom. I have NEVER worked for them but have met many unhappy workers. Your stores have turned into trash. I am going to enjoy watching one of the GREEDIEST corporations go down the tubes. Not to mention the hit China will take after Walmart goes bankrupt. I will be laughing while I am shopping anywhere but there. I have talk to many many who feel the same way from different towns and States."
3519,42842,Alex Walterscheid,21/07/2021,Walmart,Ordering online is so convenient and easy.
3520,42843,Dylan Hallett,21/07/2021,Walmart,WHAT KIND OF MUTI MILLION DOLLAR COMPANY WOULD USE LASERSHIP?!?! How f***ing dare you use crooks to deliver packages!
3521,42844,Thomas Murphy,21/07/2021,Walmart,I am happy with the products I buy with Walmart. My complaint is with the delivery. Why is it that the delivery person has to throw my item on the porch ? Just walk 4 or 5 more steps and you can place it on the porch. I had a delivery today and I happened to be sitting on the corner of the porch reading the paper. The delivery person walked up to where the stairs start ( 4 little stairs ) and threw the box on to the porch with such force the box opened.
3522,42845,Shirley Streeter,21/07/2021,Walmart,Returns and replacements do not occur easily. I am referring to an over $400 replacement. I eventually asked for a refund.
3523,42846,Breanna Bullock,21/07/2021,Walmart,"Where should I begin? The lying, poor customer service, or the app itselfâ€¦ I just had the worst experience ever with Walmart. I told my sister I did not want to deal with Walmart. I bought an item in March and Walmart has recharged me three times pertaining the situation. I never received the item and Walmart lied and said the vendor recharged me. I called the vendor and they said that was not the truth. Walmart then deactivated my account because Iâ€™m calling about my items. My experience with Walmart online has made me completely hate them. I barely go in the stores now. The couriers they use forge signatures, or lie and say itâ€™s been delivered. Walmart donâ€™t care about their customers. They want out beat Amazon but customer service is horrible. At least Amazon take the time to make sure things are correct. Walmart hang up in your face and donâ€™t really help. It took me to call the vendors to get help because Walmart was lying on the vendor. Iâ€™m not mad about Walmart closing my account because I donâ€™t want no one taking my money and I donâ€™t have the items. Walmart need to do better. Returns and refunds are part of online orders because either you donâ€™t get he items, the items are broken, or just donâ€™t want them anymore. The customer should not be punished. Walmart should leave to the stores because these rude online reps are horrible. Unless Walmart taking accountability for there actions and either firing reps or holding reps accountable for their actions donâ€™t reach out. Walmart let me down too much in one day."
3524,42847,Jeff Simmons,21/07/2021,Walmart,"TERRIBLE. ORDERED A COUCH WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DELIVERED WITHIN DAYS! THE DAY OF ARRIVAL, A MESSAGE WAS SENT THAT IT HADN'T EVEN LEFT THEIR DISTRIBUTION CENTER. Walmart said it would be there one week later, so I cancelled the order. The couch shows up. I had to call over 4 times, and no one came to pick it up. The have not refunded me. TERRIBLE COMPANY. I WILL USE OTHER ONLINE RETAILERS INSTEAD. WALMART SUCKS."
3525,42848,sharon kirubakar,21/07/2021,Walmart,"My worst experience in Walmart store (in 4040 Nolensville Pike, Nashville, TN 37211).. Around 7:30pm I went to the shop to purchase a car battery.. I see no one on the Auto section to open to lock to pick battery.. After a 15 min search finally I find a senior associate with keys.. He opens it and asks me to carry the heavy battery to the customer service section which was at the other end then on reaching the customer service location he asks me to bring my old battery which was outside my car, I go out and bring my old battery.. He was chatting with 3-4 other associates and I wait there for another 5 mins and he sends another senior associate to help me.. She just came said ""oh the customer service is closed come back tomorrow"".. what ??? DID THEY THINK I AM IDIOT?? they make me carry the heavy battery from one end to another end then ask me to go out and carry my old battery, make me wait and then cooly tell Customer Service is closed ?? You all literally broke my back.. 3-5 associates were cooly chatting at the money center but you closed the customer service at 7:30pm??.. Another thing.. You had so many counters but just opened 1 cash counter and there was like 15 - 20 ppl in queue and one was my wife.. Are you punishing us for shopping in Walmart?? You have no respect for Customers like us and we have been loyally shopping at your place.. I lost all respect for Walmart today.. I need a Manager to look into my concern and respond..."

3529,47055,D Trader,22/07/2018,Walmart,Obviously one needs to be aware of Walmart's quality of merchandise and employees. You pay for what you get. Minimum wage employees will provide minimum level of service. Completely understandable. I have come to expect the automatic 'I don't know ' responses and the 'we don't have ' answers. But this weeks response surprised me. Apparently at store no. 02650 at 4301 Byberry Rd Philadelphia- they are unable to accept returns or exchanges because there computers are down and suggest returning next week...not tomorrow...but next week!. Whatever did store managers do before computers??? How did they function?
3530,46665,Melissa Lancaster,22/07/2019,Walmart,I have ordered 3 items on the Next day delivery list and I have waited 1 full week for all 3 items to ship a week later!!!! They don't honor the next day shipping!!! Amazon is MUCH better.
3531,46666,Ariel Tidwell,22/07/2019,Walmart,"Just go to Amazon.. Walmart has the same thing as them, but slower, and less efficient.. I've tried so many times over the years to order an important item from Walmart to be let down every time! You never find out till weeks or a month later,when you have to figure out on your own that your products have not and are not going to arrive.. ever!! A few times they have sold out of products after I paid for and bought them, they just threw my money back on my card in those cases and didn't ship me anything.. so a month later when I'm like where's my air conditioner it's hot as hell outside, I find out it's not coming.. and if they've doubled the price if I try to get it againðŸ¤®then my product says it's arrived when I followed the freaking tracking, but it hasn't.. not Walmart problem, even though that's where you were shopping! they will refer you to somebody else that you are actually buying stuff from to fix the problem and hope that they are competent.. usually they're not!! So they steal your money.. if you do get it, it takes weeks. Amazon for the win, Walmart YOU SUCK"

I go back and forth between eBay, Walmart and Amazon. The problem is that Walmart does not keep their stores stocked with a lot of the items they advertise that they sell so you have to end up ordering online which I think is crazy but that's how it is and when you end up ordering online it's not always with Walmart they are third-party sellers that is why Walmart does not refund from third-party sellers so be careful what you order and keep an eye out for third-party sellers because a lot of times the third party sellers are from China..."
3535,44785,Soras,22/07/2020,Walmart,"Walmart did nothing to help customers during March April and May with the pandemic. Useless. Now that things have opened up more where I live Walmart is still doing nothing to help customers. Iâ€™m 70 years old and wanted to buy an item that can only be purchased in store, per their website. It said several local stores had the item in stock but I still called. I was told stores cannot check to see if an item is actually in stock - had to go in. I drove the distance and went into a not all that clean store and of course they didnâ€™t have the item. I called 800# customer service and was told they couldnâ€™t do anything. Not one thing. I asked a supervisor if if she could call the next store which supposedly had the item in stock. It was a 45 minute drive away. She refused saying itâ€™s â€œnot part of the process.â€ So I drove and couldnâ€™t find the item. I waited at the customer service area for over 5 minutes while nobody else was in line but the 2 guys behind the counter were talking and laughing and had no interest in helping me. I stayed patient. Finally they stopped talking and I was called up to the counter and yet again the store didnâ€™t have the item. 4 calls to customer service resulted in no help whatsoever. I had a list of items to get at Walmart along with what I went for - something I promised my granddaughter Iâ€™d get - their website says stores have it. But they donâ€™t have it and I decided after all I went through not to purchase anything else on my list from Walmart. I went to Target. Iâ€™m done with rude, ineffective, unclean, uncaring, useless Walmart."

Walmart gave her the run around had the exact same conversation with 7 different employees before she had enough and demanded her money back so they took the couch back already but still no money back and I really don't get why they didn't just give her a new couch to replace the Garbage she received.. basically Walmart online is a rip off and a joke to them they clearly don't care about their older online customers they just rip them off
3541,42838,Andrea Zrycki,22/07/2021,Walmart,"I tried giving Walmart a chance. I purchased on July 10th a queen mattress that was supposed to be delivered on the 15th. I actually bought 2 mattresses and the full was delivered on the 19th/late, after delays emails, they delivered my item in a different city and someone signed for it. So now I have to call and dispute with my credit card. Walmart doesn't take accountability for the error. Worst experience ever. No wonder Amazon is a lead in this market."
3542,40409,Diane McCullah Mendoza,22/07/2022,Walmart,"As usual, when ordering online from WalMart.com, the order can (and did) arrive in several deliveries. After a week I received a text & email saying my last package was delivered at my front porch....nothing was there. Checked my camera & no one ever approached my house. No package in mail either. Called CS & was told that some delivery companies will anticipate delivery & post it prior to actually being completed & I should wait a few days. Now we all know that is hogwash, especially from USPS. I waited & called USPS the next day only to find that the tracking number was for a pkg. to a different person/address. Called CS again & requested another shipment be sent expedited. That was when the 3rd party seller BS was started. Bottom line, they will not stand behind any product that is coming from a 3rd party seller even though you order from WalMart & pay on your WalMart card. The last CS supervisor I spoke to was the rudest person I have ever dealt with at ANY company. Granted by this time I was furious but I never cursed or rose my voice. He was condescending & rude. This whole situation was the total opposite of how they treated me during the pandemic, when they needed our business. Their CS has totally bottomed out & I am not speaking of the CS agents answering the phones but of their protocol. I am surprised that the agents aren't less helpful & courteous given the example shown by one of their supervisors. I am a W+ customer but I will no longer be ordering online from WalMart & will not be renewing my subscription when it expires."
3543,40410,Tracy Carmichael,22/07/2022,Walmart,I am highly disappointed in Walmart all of Walmart's policies have changed Walmarts do not answer their telephones the managers of the Walmart stores do not comply with customers even when the customer is not asking anything above and beyond just asking for their money to be returned in the way of the receipt still Walmart will not comply it is left up to the store manager supposedly corporate has no authority over the store managers so why there's even a corporate I'm not sure I highly suggest anybody who wants to shop at Walmart check into Walmart policies or you might be in a situation highly disappointed and left untaken care of
3544,40411,B,22/07/2022,Walmart,Allowing scalpers to sell their massively overpriced products on your website is not a good look. Terrible company.
3545,47331,chris,23/07/2014,Walmart,I really love this site.
3546,46663,Paula R,23/07/2019,Walmart,"Seriously, why purchase ANYthing from Walmart when it is obtainable with excellent customer service from Amazon. I have experienced multiple issues with dismal service from Walmart at all levels. I don't even want to waste my time any more detailing the substandard encounters I have had; after spending the last several days trying to resolve an issue with them to no avail, I am through. Amazon is there waiting with open arms...run to them and don't look back!"
3547,46664,Stephen Counceller,23/07/2019,Walmart,Bad service and the manager walks around while theirs a line outside the building. I've been waiting 35 min while your manager walks around looking stupid. I will go to payless for now on bad service lazy people too

3550,44781,Mike Masri,23/07/2020,Walmart,"I have purchased a fryer from Walmart site, I went to return the item because it was too big, I followed the website instructions and printed the return receipt to take to the store on north Tryon the told me they donâ€™t have shipping labels, Really!!! So I called the Walmart online help and I wasnâ€™t helpful at all. So Iâ€™m now stuck with this item. This will never happen with Amazon. So Iâ€™m cancelling my online account with Walmart and giving my business to Amazon because of their great customer service. I have spent thousands with Walmart and now itâ€™s all going to Amazon."
3551,44782,Clark A. Jones,23/07/2020,Walmart,"Product is good, but the delivery was last. They said my product will be delivered to my address on June 15, but it's been delivered to me yesterday."
3552,36193,Tofurry,23/07/2018,Amazon Go,"Fun experience, prices are typical for the area Now that Amazon Go is open to the public, there can be a line depending on when you decide to visit. It is really fun to just scan in the Amazon Go app linked to your Amazon account (for each person in your party if they do not have their own apps), take whatever you want to buy and walk out. Lots of tourists picking up Amazon Go exclusive items like Theo Chocolate, mugs and water bottles. You can also grab a reusable orange shopping bag while supplies last.  Prices are typical for the area. The nice thing is that there are a lot of vegetarian and even vegan choices. We've tried the curry tofu sandwich, and a couple of other vegan selections and they've all been good.  Some time after you leave, you will get an email from Amazon with a total for what you picked up. Try it once!"
3553,36345,Sa Y.,23/07/2018,Amazon Go,"Just make sure you scan each time your troop go in if you are with others. I don't know how it works, but I found it easy. Choices are not great, but side salad was pretty good. If I'm them, I create Vegan zone."
3554,36257,Jessica O.,23/07/2019,Amazon Go,"Shopping can't get easier! Amazon Go is a convenient store where you scan their app and then pick out whatever you like and then just walk out of the building. It charges it through the app without you even having to swipe a card! I noticed that there are other locations in Seattle, along with San Francisco, NYC, and Chicago. They are building more in those locations but I hope that they build more in other cities! I would love having stores like this close by since I already use Apple Pay often, but this is even more time saving! I believe that tourist often stop by these locations just like I did. So my recommendation is that there are a few unique (gift shop type) items for purchase also like a mug  or stickers. Definitely worth checking out it's a futuristic experience and a mystery of how it works."

3556,40380,Kevin Joseph,23/07/2022,Walmart,Bought a flashlight from the website from one of their star sellers. The flashlight arrived inoperable as the Li-ion battery will not take a charge.

I called them the next morning and was told it was still processing and call the store. The store said call customer service. I called customer service they said call the store. Finally I got someone in customer service to at least talk to me. She said the order was picked up and then cancelled. I am like HUH, I didn't cancel it, when will I get my order or a refund? Well your order was picked up and and cancelled. OK.....so where is it. Well ma'am your order was picked up and cancelled. OK..... so where is my order? I could not get a straight answer so I said to cancel it and refund my money. Ok...so she cancelled and aparently my refund will not be sent for 7-10 days. UMM......UM WHAT? So I have to wait 7-10 business days to get my grocery money back so I can buy food for my family? In this economy, living paycheck to paycheck I have to wait a week or more before I can get my grocery money back? HORRIBLE, try not to shop walmart.

It was a hardship on me because I am a physician on the frontlines and I work a lot. In order to get my money back i had to go stand in line at the post office and return it. Before this was even initiated I was told over and over by walmart that I had to make contact with their seller. It took me 1 week of begging the seller to let me have my money back. They did no t wantt o send me the right itrm or give me mymoney back. They told me to send pics of the item and i did exactly what theys aid so they could giveme mymoney back. After going through all of that they never asnwered me back. I messaged them more than 4 times and nothing! Walmart will back the seller before the paying customer.

I was overcharged on several items. The sound as each item is scanned is confusing if you are near someone else as they check out so, again you can't go back and see if it scanned. I suppose you could try to get someone's attention but they have one clerk for the 20 or so checkout counters. I rarely go there and will continue to rarely go there. And you have to wear a mask but NOT ALL the employees comply. Whay wear a mask when they don't??????????"

Now a ""3rd party"" seller has it at a higher price. Yeah, that's a sneaky upsale if I ever saw one. This happens everytime with you. I purchase all of my children's Christmas gifts online every year from many different companies, make 95% of all my purchases online and yet Wal-Mart is the ONLY company I've ever had an issue with. Please tell me how is it that Wal-Mart is such a large company yet the system only updates stock every 24 hours?! You made us miss out on taking advantage of our tax free weekend and now all you can do is try to upsale me? I'm not even one to write things like this and I simply don't have the time but I'm just so disgusted with these sneaky tactics.

Now what am I going to do with those if I don't have a thermometer - not much thought put into that! When I tried to start a refund online, minutes after receiving the order, I got the message that the order was no longer eligible for returns! Tried phoning the store but no one picked up. So I tried the online chat and - bingo! - I was helped very efficiently by Corlas! While Corlas gets 5 stars from me, the whole procedure only gets 3 (and that is only because the chat tool was offered). Walmart needs to make the return process more user-friendly."
3604,44773,Anna Messmer,25/07/2020,Walmart,"honestly they dont even deserve 1 star. This is the second time in the past month they have steered me wrong. First time I ordered an inflatable pool (2 in stock at a store across town) so i say thats fine its not the closest walmart but its hard to find pools right now. Between the time where I placed my order and the order was taken off of the shelf by an employee for me to come pick up (i am assuming this is what happened) someone had bought the last 2. Walmart Cancelled my order. HORRIBLE service. THEN i go to order a karaoke machine for my daughter...in store pickup within about a week ok thats fine...2 days before her birthday it should be ready ... we are waiting patiently as Thursday comes around and the order is pushed to Friday, friday comes around (at 7 pm i get an order delayed email) i call them and they say the order was yet again CANCELLED. Thanks for almost ruining my daughters birthday. DONT WORRY Target made it right and we bought their last one they had in stock TARGET TO THE RESCUE I am so done with Walmart. This is just one reason why i never shop here."
3605,36236,Kislev A.,25/07/2018,Amazon Go,"What an interesting concept. I could certainly get behind this as I now discovered that going to the grocery store for work lunches is easy, convenient, fast and offers more options and is cheaper than going to a restaurant.  If I was working in the area, and it looks like Amazon Go is located at the heart of the Amazon complex/campus, you can just walk in and walk out to grab your lunch, snacks and drinks and not stand in line. Almost like a cafeteria at work, Very cool.  Very interesting."
3606,40370,Hoda Samii,25/07/2022,Walmart,"I placed an order (food item) on Walmart.com More than two weeks ago, the order never arrived even though they had already charged my credit card. I called their customer service people and asked them to cancel my order, the guy with very limited English told me that they could not cancel the order!! He offered to send an email to the seller and ask if they would cancel it!!!!! He said the seller will contact you within 48 hours to let you know if it was possible to cancel because the order was probably shipped!! FYI: there is no tracking info available. I asked to speak to a manager, he said let me see if they are available to talk to you!! I had the honor to talk to this manager, he repeated the same exact thing, of course I had to guess some of what he was trying to say in English. I ended up hanging up the phone. My credit card company helped me file a complaint and issued a refund for me. I would never trust Walmart. Good thing we have Amazon."

3614,47051,L. Eubanks,26/07/2018,Walmart,"I am currently at the WalMart located at 5501 Hwy 6 in Missouri City, TX. An East Indian employee in the auto department was very rude to me and other customers. I explained to him that I had been waiting for 45 minutes without receiving a ticket for service to have a tire replaced and what the procedure is for customers to follow for service. He bluntly and rudely told me that if I hadn't received a ticket then I wasn't getting a tire today. He then told me to go outside. I told him I had already been outside and they told me to wait inside. He bluntly and rudely told me again that I wasn't getting a tire today. I walked to the door to talk to an outside employee who respected customers and the East Indian man would not press the buzzer for me to exit. I had to ask him if he would let me out! I explained the situation to the on duty manager and he simply stated he would talk to him later. I then called Corporare who simply said they would forward my complaint to the manager which is not helpful at all given I just spoke with him. I will definitely not refer anyone to shop WalMart and advise them to shop some place where customers are treated well."

3617,47059,Bev of NOHO,26/07/2018,Walmart,"UPDATE#2 ........(PLUS 1 STAR) (See below for original review) Since my first update on their customer service, Walmart reached out in response to my review. Not only did they ask how my experience could've been improved but they refunded me 20% and gifted me $25 on my next purchase. It was totally unexpected and has modified my opinion on their customer service caring about their customers. Hopefully my next experience will warrant 4 or 5 stars. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ORIGINAL REVIEW I'm a very new Walmart customer. I've never had enough confidence in the quality of products to purchase from the stores. However, online I found hard to find name brand items for less than anyone else offered and with free shipping. I couldn't pass that up.  - Unfortunately, the large ticket item's delivery date kept changing without explanation. If not for the cost savings I would've canceled straight away. - Customer service, however, was very efficient. She was patient with me and my angry rant. Was able to find an acceptable reason for the delay that satisfied me.  I'll definitely purchase again (name brands only), if the savings warrants and I don't need it right away. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ UPDATE: CUSTOMER SERVICE DOESN'T LISTEN. (MINUS 1 STAR) I had 3 customer chats about the same product, above was my 2nd, this is about my 3rd. I contacted them when I received a ""delivered"" email but no package. She claimed the system had gotten ahead of the driver, even though he described specifically where he'd left the package at the location. She refused to listen. Now I have to wait AGAIN for a replacement. I was offered NOTHING to compensate for the inconvenience. - I'm not sure now the savings is worth the frustrations and headaches. I totally get the low ratings now."
3618,47065,Tim,26/07/2018,Walmart,"I placed an order with 2 day shipping last week. 9 days later, still no package. I request a call from customer service, and they were no help and rude to boot.  Updates: It only went downhill from here. Damaged package (not walmarts fault) was handled poorly. Slow â€œexpeditedâ€ shipping. Of the replacement, lots of hassle scheduling the return shipment.  Ultimately I had to return the item, and they told me to return it to the store. Then the store would only offer a gift card because it was a replacement for the damaged item, so I had to call back and get a return label instead. Then they gave me the wrong type of label, so I had to call back twice more to get a proper label, then again for them to schedule the pick up because fed ex would not allow me to schedule the pick up on their account.  Ultimately Iâ€™d rather pay twice as much elsewhere than to ever deal with walmart.com again."

3620,46652,Howard Smith,26/07/2019,Walmart,Purchased a Toshiba TY-CWU500 boombox through Walmart partner Clover Hill which has the lowest consumer satisfaction rating of 1 star online out of 5. Item description was it is only a bluetooth am/fm CD player going for $159 and when I got it I read the real product description of it going for $100 on average. Thieves buyer beware don't buy Walmart online you'll be sorry....
3621,46653,Jacob,26/07/2019,Walmart,Ordered a Kayak for a trip. Should have arrived 7/19. As of 7/26 and MULTIPLE (12+) phone calls between myself and Walmart and myself and XPO I was told my kayak was shipped to the wrong depot. However Walmart has no record of that and tried to tell me it would be delivered today. I then sent them the email I received from XPO after talking to 5 people there that shows the kayak still in KS not St. Louis. I've tried to cancel my order and it (not possible) at this stage. Will NEVER use walmart.com again. The absolute worst customer service
3622,46654,Poopsie Sing,26/07/2019,Walmart,"DUPLICATE CHARGE - there was no resolve, I will Never order from Walmart again if I have to go thru a duplicate charge, which the reason that Walmart gave to me is UNACCEPTABLE. And the response that I should call my bank is also Unacceptable. Why use the internet service if I spend more aggravated time on the phone with total incompetent response and knowledge from Walmart personnel. Walmart BS, never again"

3625,44767,Alex K,26/07/2020,Walmart,"Omg! They must be hiring brain damaged people to pack the boxes! They sent me 4 148oz huge detergent bottles in medium cardboard box with some other small items and a few of those air filled bubble wrap things. And ONE piece of tape over the top (not even around the entire box) what do you think happened? THE BOX BUSTED. Any fully functioning adult would expect that to happen. Why would they pack a box like this?! They will loose more money in charge backs then on the little bit of extra money it would take to send an additional box. And they wanna compete with amazon?! HA! Amazon hires people with brains bc Amazon actually pays a decent wage.  In addition. I placed this order on a Thursday afternoon for next day delivery. I got my items Sunday. Busted.... and broken.  HOWEVER, when I spent the time and energy to get a human on the phone at Walmart.com, they issued me a refund for the broken and missing items and they sent me a $25 coupon to apologize for the late delivery.  I guess not EVERYONE is brain dead..."

3627,42826,Michelle Rock,26/07/2021,Walmart,I am actual customer i have video taped my encounters. I am disabled with service dog and have gone to numerous locations and states in Walmart they do not train employees on properly addressing us. Employees are allowed to tell me i am faking my disability to have a service dog. Are you serious do you understand the responsibility and sometimes hassle of having pet just imagine have service dog on top of normal training i had to train to my disability and how to adapt when new issues arrive I'm its embarrassing the way employees come.at you stressful an emotional mess meanwhile I know my service dog wants to defend me react off my emotions or what sisutation has triggered from disabled discrimination yet she does not bark bite move etc unlesd you decide you want to reach over her and physically remove me still.no reaction until I give.command yet she is not service dog.Report to Walmart if they bother to respond its a.bunch of excuses they often throw employee under.bus when they are responsible for training they say they will train inform alert yet this usually happens a good 20 times per year I quit reporting there are no accountability no resoulation no feedback. So i shop online which is worst .Your packages are throw dropped slide or hurtled at your door. If they are actually there when you.come.home. Replacement is wonderful yet if i ordered a product i apparently needed it at that time or for a reason shipping again giving money back does not help because now i have to wait ir repurchase and if damaged lets how its visable or defective issue starts before warranty ends or had product to long i could be billed and held responsible when i knoe.it was supposed to.work longer than it took ro.give me problems. If you ask me for delivery instructions at least have cutesy to follow do not leave if no answer means just that call me if no one answers do self explanatory it is high traffic area in apartment no where to leave but you will leave box walk away. I place blame on Walmart not delivery company because it is too many delivery issues and you have not taken action change companies demanded better treatment of their customers because they don't care its about bottom line employees don't get paid enough bags break as you are putting groceries in car Walmart neighbor in lithonia only sold beef pork products i don't eat either not religious reason yet if it were still issues I asked the white manger why certain brands and items were not carried and could I request chicken or beef products in certain things or brands items etc now where i lived in douglasville no problem yet spent most time in area eventually moved so i was appalled when i ask for lamb chops and pesto he said black people did not eat enough of us did that it was selling out at regular Walmart other locations and Kroger I asked about Turkey bacon lunch meat etc he said we stock for the area and surrounding community ok.fine i asked is it assumption or.actual need did you actually ask or go to other stores and see what community was buying because your watermelon bin.is always full your grape jelly jars have dust on them you don't have enough varieties of the things we actually do by well the store closed. I heard the reason was crime never bothered to look into but if never lines in store can never find what you want or need and prices higher than most bad customer service not just me speaking on issues i guess you would have to close I use alas yet can be easily found I can provide my actual name and video if needed I have experience retaliation in past and just want to be able to Express with out conflict
3628,42827,Donna Marie Romano,26/07/2021,Walmart,Last week I was notified my order was â€œdeliveredâ€ it wasnâ€™t. â€œSomeoneâ€ brought it late the following day. But not BEFORE I had to go out and replace the dog food etc that was SO CALLED â€œdeliveredâ€ Today Iâ€™m waiting on a very expensive face cream. Been using it for 5 years. Smells wonderful. Has a very distinct lovely smell. Mine just arrived. Doesnâ€™t have any fragrance whatsoever. Itâ€™s not from Walmart. Itâ€™s from a third party vendor which I figured because they donâ€™t sell Dr Gross. So Walmart you just continually destroy your customer basis. I refuse to enter your stores so I buy online. Never ever again. Iâ€™m sending back for a refund and I will also contact this third party. What a joke! If someone ordered this and never used it before theyâ€™d have no idea!!!! What a surprise! This vendor doesnâ€™t exists! ALL YOU WALMART. YOU SUCK

3632,42831,Michele Clark,26/07/2021,Walmart,"Walmart's rating and expectations have gone down drastically since getting rid of cashiers. In March, 2021 I purchased a set of tires with a warranty. One of the tires has a nail in it. I have been calling Walmart Tire Centers in Hammond, IN (219-989-0833) constantly and no one has even bothered answering the phones. Even called customer service with the same results. No cashiers and no customer service. They have made billions from customers like you and I and now can't be bothered to even answer their phones."

It didn't (through no fault of theirs), but they wouldn't let me return it to the store, it had to be picked up for a shipping company.  I wasn't called to arrange a time so they marked it as a no-show twice, then I finally got them to pick it up... that was a month ago. Still waiting on my refund. After many calls to Walmart and conversations with people who are reading a script with no authority to do anything about it, and they don't like to transfer me to someone who can actually help. It seems the shipping company lost it, but Walmart won't refund me until it gets back to them, as opposed to the shipping company.  So basically my money is being held hostage because of a problem that I have no control over. If I could take the item back, at least I could do something.

3642,47172,Heather mcgill,27/07/2017,Walmart,"I went to WalMart to print a couple photos from my wedding, which was several years ago. I used the self printing station to transfer photos from my phone gallery and then went to the counter to pay, the man asks me if I took the photos myself (which I obv didn't since I was in them), I said no. He asked for my contract with the photographer, which I didn't have since A) it was several years ago and B) my husband took care of it. He explained I needed to prove the photos were mine to duplicate. I tried to call the photographer but they didn't answer. Then he gets some other associate to come ""help"" him. At that point I was on the phone with my husband asking if he had a copy in his email of the contract and she began talking over me even though I was on the phone trying to straighten this all out. She then flat out accused me of stealing the prints by taking a photo of a photo. I pointed out that the photographer logo would still be present if the photos weren't mine and she said I cropped them out. I asked wouldn't the logo be in the middle of the photo? She said some pictures had better quality than others and that meant I was stealing them. At this point I was shaking, I have not and would not steal from anyone. I tried showing both associates that I had the entire album on my phone, crystal clear with no logos and they said they did not want to see them, well I am sorry but you are asking me for proof over and over and that was as close as I could get to proof and then you don't want to see them? I understand protecting rights, but I feel like these 2 associates were completely out of bounds and mishandled the situation left and right and instead chose to create a scene and accuse a customer of theft, loudly, even while I was calling around to obtain proof we purchased the rights. Even the customer behind me was uncomfortable and left the line. A manager should have been called immediately if there was doubt, not 2 associates ganging up on a customer. Luckily, when I called my husband back, he remembered we have a USB drive with all our pictures that was given to us by the photographers and we went to a different store to print the photos that I wanted. When I posted about this interaction on Facebook, I am apparently not the only person displeased with the photo dept and one person even told me they shredded her photos in front of her even though it was a photo she took with her own camera. I will not be returning to the Walmart photo dept ever again, and it will be a long time before I step foot in this chain for any other purchases either."

I called the next day they wouldnâ€™t cancel the order and said it was my fault for letting my grandson use my phone I wonâ€™t order anything from there again customer service sucks! Billion dollar company they care more about profits than customers or employees. Long story short screw Walmart!

3648,42818,Amad Persaud,27/07/2021,Walmart,"Terrible customer service from Walmart and seller. If the were a negative star that's what they would receive. I had made a purchase on July 15, 2021. My order was supposed to be shipped and delivered by July 21, 2021. On the 21 I got an email saying my package in on the front porch, I had been in my garage all morning and no delivery had been made. I then reached out the the delivery company and gave them my tracking #, they then told me I had a wrong tracking # for my item and they told me to contact Walmart. I then reached out to Walmart.com and they told me they can not do a thing for me I would need to reach out to the seller. What a load of B.S. I made my purchase from Walmart.com. I then reached out to the seller and they told me they can't do anything except refund my money, (partially). I then reached back out to Walmart and told them I don't want a refund I want my product that I ordered. They had told me again they can not do anything for me, once I get fully refunded I would have to repurchase the product. They same item now is $100 more once I reach back out to the sell and Walmart I basically got told to go blow a whistle. Thanks for the customer service. I will never make another purchase from Walmart.com again. GOOD LUCK TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE."
3649,42819,Zakia moosavi,27/07/2021,Walmart,"Online orders suck at Walmart, I hv lost many items in the past year, they send a picture of the product delivered when the business is closed and honestly never seen the product .. I donâ€™t trust the delivery system of Walmart .."
3650,42820,Zahra Mousavi Razi,27/07/2021,Walmart,"I bought some underwear from the Walmart store (5400 Rue Jean-Talon O) about 10 days ago and because their size was not suitable, I had to return them but the store did not accept and said that underwear cannot be returned while this was not mentioned at the time of purchase.  I always buy from Walmart and I have always been satisfied with its services, but this time I was really disappointed. Just some days after my purchase I went to Walmart to return them but your colleague said to me, I could not do anything and you should call our customer service to solve your problem, I called the customer service (514-735-5295) several times but no one answered! I also chatted with the Walmart help center and they said we only can solve the online purchase problem and you have to call the customer service of the Walmart branch."
3651,42821,AJD,27/07/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a Rubbermaid shack on 6/20/21 with a delivery date of 7/27/21. Talked with a rep on the 21st of July and he confirmed the item was getting prepared for shipment and I will receive a tracking number by noon on Friday. On Monday the 26th I called asking for details and was told that the shed, is not in stock and they do not know when they will receive it. The fact that the reps can not tell the customer the truth about an order really speaks volume of how Walmart treats its customers. I will never order anything from Walmart and I promise to tell as many folks about this experience as I can."
3652,42822,Brooke Payne,27/07/2021,Walmart,"I bought a brownie cake from Walmart, cut into it, and it was literally raw. Like pinch it between your fingers and it would goop apart. It was undercooked, health hazard raw. So I called customer support and told them that I bought a raw cake, was put on hold, and they said someone should reach out in 5 days and that's all they could do. Customer service should know how to resolve a problem like that without just putting it off on someone else."
3653,42823,Chris,27/07/2021,Walmart,They failed to ship me a product I purchased online. I waited a month and a half and then had to fight for a refund. It took me several calls and hours on the phone to get my money back. Totally unacceptable for an item I couldâ€™ve purchased elsewhere. The worst part is the purchase was made on my credit card so I had to payoff my card before I got my credit or pay a 20% interest rate.
3654,42824,Renee Mclaughlin,27/07/2021,Walmart,I wonâ€™t be ordering from wallmart ever again. I was sent the wrong order and I was on hold for 2 hours trying to make amend. I was so infuriated I was growling like a feral dog on a leash trying to get a price of meat on the sidewalk. Please do better wallmart! For the sake of your future customers. Not me though. Because I wonâ€™t be back.
3655,42825,marie winter,27/07/2021,Walmart,Today i ordered online from the APP walmart+.....I had gotten 2 emails one confirming the order and a second stating item replacements. I had noticed my order was not showing on the APP so I called customer service. I was told they did not recieve my order which was a lie because i got the emails. So i lost money which i have to wait to get refunded. And did not get my items. Before that i ordered another time and it was 2 food items that were not good. I have ordered online groceries for quite some time never had it where your order disappeared not showing up. I do not recommend WALMART.COM....Try other delivery APPS like insta cart and such.
3656,47048,Carolina,28/07/2018,Walmart,"I appreciate the free shipping, however it takes a while. Iâ€™ve ordered many things and sometime they split up the items in my box rather than keep them together. I really donâ€™t appreciate making the order, splitting up my items and receiving one item on one day and the other 2 weeks later."
3657,47049,Saahil Jaswani,28/07/2018,Walmart,"Shopping on Walmart.com has always been smooth as it is very easy to find the exact product one is looking for. The items are never too highly priced neither of a bad quality. I recently bought a $10 smartwatch from walmart, surprisingly the quality of the watch is too good for its price. Honestly i did not expect it to be as good as it turned out to be because of its price. A perfect gift item.  Look for the watch by putting in the following name on walmart - Style Asia Bluetooth Smartwatch with HD Screen for Android & iOS with Camera, SMS Synchronization and Calls Alert"
3658,46648,Richard,28/07/2019,Walmart,Returned by mail broken DVD ...... After going back and forth with customer no service I gave up.... After 8 months got no where and am still out my money.... NEVER AGAIN.... Would give them a Zero if I could !!!
3659,44759,Dustin M.,28/07/2020,Walmart,"Store #1405 is horrible..went today to pick up a couple things with my kids and was asked if we wanted a mask and I said No thanks and was allowed in the store only to be stopped by a manager that got way closer than 6ft and he told me to get out of his store or put masks on. I informed him that I can't wear a mask due to the laws on concealed carry and I had my pistol on me,I was then told he didn't care about the laws on guns and to take my kids and leave.. it is unacceptable to be treated that way and it needs to be fixed now. I had my kids asking if it was because we are white and he was Mexican and I told my kids I hope that's not why he treated is like that but I don't know. Not everyone is able to wear a face covering due to health or religion and it's wrong to force a customer to leave not knowing or caring to know the situation. I believe if someone can't have a face covering then they must do self checkout, not thrown out of a store with their kids. People need to open their eyes and see this is the work of the devil and me and my household will follow God and his word,God says ""help one another"" not kick them out with their kids. This one a manager who needs more training and respect. He could have asked what we needed to get and could've helped us get it so we wouldn't be inside long but instead he made the choice to get in my face in front of my kids and talk to me like a nobody and I thought Walmart had better customer service than that? Very very disappointed in Walmart right now and won't go back till I get an apology and able to get the things me and my kids needed."
3660,44760,Ray Suntinger,28/07/2020,Walmart,My wife and I shop at Walmart at least 1 to 2 days a week. We went to shop there today and were not allowed in there because of the mask. We will not shop there as much anymore. We will be going to Dollar General instead. We felt discriminated against because of the lies that the media is telling us.
3661,44761,David owens,28/07/2020,Walmart,"The neighborhood store on Custer and Parker is a disaster. They stick sale signs over milk and other items, but do not change the computer. Yesterday I was doing self check out, when the milk price came up different from the posted price. I called the floor mgr. and showed her a photo I had taken of the posted price. She refused to adjust it. I told her to remove the milk from my tab, and left the milk at the checkout."
3662,44762,Jessica Sexton,28/07/2020,Walmart,Damn it's pretty bad when the dollar store is open later than Walmart how is it ok for y'all to be open during the day as long as ppl wear masks but not after 8:30
3663,44763,Dawn,28/07/2020,Walmart,Idk how people have issues with Walmart. They always have good items and lower prices and shipping is great and returns are easy as pie.
3664,36214,Jessica Z.,28/07/2019,Amazon Go,"Certainly puts the ""convenience"" into ""convenience store"". My boyfriend wanted to check it out while we were visiting Seattle, and yup, it was a cool and quick experience. There were quite a few people inside the small store on the Friday afternoon we dropped by.  To enter, you need the Amazon Go app, which is synced with your Amazon account, on your phone, but you can additionally swipe in family members and others at the turnstiles. My guess is that when someone is swiped in, some information about that person is captured and tied to the account, and then cameras continue to track that person around the store. When someone grabs an item off a shelf, and when that person places it back, it's processed by cameras and sensors. (Notably, Amazon claims that no facial recognition technology is used.) One thing that would be nice is if, while in store, the app told you what items you'd selected as well as the total price in your cart, so that you could see what would be eventually charged. I think after we walked out, the items bought were in ""pending"" status for a while.  The food is better than your standard convenience store, albeit not super extensive or impressive. There are some pretty decent prepared food options, and some that looked relatively healthy. They've also got some alright snacks and a small fruit section. I walked out with a bag of oddly addicting dry-roasted edamame and one of the few unbruised bananas. Afterwards, we sat by the Spheres (which is a pretty pleasant outdoor area to chill for a bit) to eat our snacks.  If this concept gets big and the stores expand to having more options, that would be awesome. I really like the efficiency of not having to interact with anyone, and not having to self checkout either. It's a novelty now, but it could be the future :)"
3665,42807,Michelle,28/07/2021,Walmart,"I've been dealing with Walmart since March 2020, I would have gave a five â­ in the beginning, butif they make sure that my items always come to my address then I would have noncompliant. It got very stressful even for the groceries to get to the right place. I don't have complaints about my refund but I rather have with I order, I'm also a Walmart plus member.. it they do have the best stuff and insurance options hands down."
3666,42808,Mrs Lippincott,28/07/2021,Walmart,"I ordered a Great Value food product. The label clearly states ""Our guarantee is our promise that you'll be fully satisfied with the quality of every Great Value product. If for any reason you aren't happy, we'll replace it or return your money. Whichever you prefer. All you need is the package. It's that simple. Guaranteed. Tell us what you think... 1-877-505-2267"" The product was ordered last August, but still in the Best if Used By Date. I called the 877 number. Was automatically disconnected. Called again. No answer. Called again, and finally got a person. She transferred me to the wrong department. When I finally got to the right place, the best he would do is give me $$ off my next online purchase of $$$. Of course, I will need to order enough to waive shipping. I would rather shop in person, but they would not do give me store credit. The bottom line... Great Value does not honor their promise or guarantee. There is no timeline on their guarantee. Great Value lies. Walmart lies."
3667,42809,Paul Nybeck,28/07/2021,Walmart,"Just yesterday morning,7/27/21, at a walmart in Surprise AZ, My wife and her 9y.o. daughter needed to stop for 3 things before my wife went to work and daughter went to camp. 2 large items my wife carried out and a pair of $15 swim goggles AFTER all were paid for at self checkout in perfect view of the door and door attendant. Proceeded to walk out of store with daughter on my wifes right side. Door attendant walked directly across and in front of my wife and asked our daughter DIRECTLY if she had a receipt for her swim goggles. Never asked my wife for anything. I know what you are thinking but let me finish. BTW, my wife is very WHITE and my daughter is very BLACK. Notified store and corporate but never expect to hear anything back. Just another racist happening in 2021...."
3668,42810,customer Randy,28/07/2021,Walmart,"I ordered off of Walmart.com and FedEx (it's not the company who I ordered it from) delivered my order to a different address. Why can't FedEx take a picture where they placed the package at like Amazon does?  Walmart.com will not stand behind the order if it is placed through their marketplace, you have to let the vendor contact you and you hope they are willing to make good on your order."
3669,42811,Johnathan Beck,28/07/2021,Walmart,"I am so very close to boycotting Walmart! I spend alot of money there weekly and that money will soon be going to another store! It's bad enough you force people to check out their own groceries(while an employee stands there gawking at you like you are a thief) but now I can't put cash in those self check outs which means if I want to use cash I have to wait in a long long for an actual cashier.....and said cashier is slow, not friendly, and checks phone every chance they get...not to mention doesn't have common sense on how to bag things!!!!! Just about DONE WITH YOU WALMART!!!"
3670,42812,Nessia Haye,28/07/2021,Walmart,"DISSAPOINTED - I placed and order for 4 tires but split it up into 2 orders so that my credit card usages would not be high. Walmart sent me 2 emails stating that both orders were ready to be picked up. I went to the store and they could not find my order, then one of the guys in the auto center told me that there was noting that they could do for me and for me to contact the 3rd party... FIRST OF ALL THIS DID NOT COME FROM A THIRD PARTY SIR THIS CAME DIRECTLY FROM WALMART. I asked to speak to a manager waited 50 minutes and never got a manager. I AM SO PISSED OFF I NEVER WANT TO STEP FOOT INSIDE ANOTHER WALMART. So after waiting for an hour and a half i left all tis time the folks that works in the auto care center all they could say is we can't help you. I WANT MY $$ BACK NOW NOT TOMORROW I WANT IT BACK NOW SO I CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND SPEND MY $$ WHERE ITS WANTED. I am so sick and tired of Walmart and the folks that they hire no customer AT ALL."
3671,42813,Steven Sledz,28/07/2021,Walmart,"I only order online because I'm a disabled veteran. I don't drive, so I need every thing delivered. Today I ordered 8 items (over $60). Every item said deliverable. After checkout, 4 of the items said PICK UP ONLY. I don't appreciate Walmart LYING TO ME JUST TO GET THE SALE. AMAZON WILL DELIVER EVERY ITEM TO ME. Walmart can kiss my B***!! This has been happening time and time again. I'm sick of Walmart. As a matter of fact, I pray for Walmart to go out of business and let Amazon take over the whole industry. No more of my money will ever reach Walmarts pocket again. It's a real shame that Walmart treats people like this."
3672,42814,cool kid,28/07/2021,Walmart,"I love shopping at walmart.but when I need cash back now you have to go to the cashier line ,in which they only have 1 or 2 and the lines be long.so why would you take it away from. self check, it.makes it very inconvenient, so I go to HEB this is in Elgin tx, but Manor 1 still does it so when I'm that way I stop there but live in elgin and they are losing business in Elgin tx."

3675,40366,Barbara Rooney,28/07/2022,Walmart,I am recanting my previous review of Walmart. I emailed the CEO about my horrible experience with a Customer Service Representative recently.  He was quick to respond to resolve my issues. The manager of Walmart on Andermatte Dr. called me and apologized.  I received a refund in less than 24 hours.  I am impressed that they do care about their customers. They listened. My issues were resolved immediately.  I am giving them a second chance.

Fortunately, I made a copy of it because once you print it, it's no longer available for you to see on their website. Yesterday (7/28), I get an email from them that they never received my return & put the charge back on my credit card. So I pull my copy & check the tracking info & sure enough, they received it on 6/5!! Another scam by Walmart to cheat customers! Beware & always keep a copy of your tracking number."
3678,46645,Eddie Anderson,29/07/2019,Walmart,I had a credit card with Walmart for some time and because I was late with a payment for 30 days my account was cancelled. I was not given any notice and I paid off my entire balance a day past the 30 days. This is perhaps the worst customer service Iâ€™ve ever received or seen!!! I lost all my credit because of the horrible communication and customer service!!!

3681,44755,Kurt,29/07/2020,Walmart,"If I could go less than 1 Star, I would. Walmart.com is horrible if you need to return anything - 1% of products they sell can be returned in store. Otherwise, you need to contact whatever third party seller they list ever so discreetly on the website. Iâ€™d rather spend a little more and deal with a single entity, not a crapshoot of who sells what."
3682,44756,Navu Kaur,29/07/2020,Walmart,really fed up from their customer service. first no body pick call. if somebody pick then they just say we will get back to you transferring call. and just hung me up and did not listen to any of my query. I wish I could give worst feedback with 0 star. :/
3683,44757,Katrina Davis,29/07/2020,Walmart,I wish I could give this 0 stars. 2 orders; one the driver tossed my bags on the porch breaking my eggs and some glass items. The other never received and they have to process the refund (it has been 3 days still not processed) and then would not return my money for 3 to 5 days after the processing.  The customer service reps when I called disconnected my calls 3 times and each call passed the buck to someone else.
3684,44758,Mark Liggett,29/07/2020,Walmart,It really bothers me when I go spend anywhere from 100$ to 500$ in Walmart almost every time I come home from being on the road workin. I work hard just like all others that work. Iâ€™m 44 years old Iâ€™m very respectful to everyone Iâ€™ll help anybody in the world if they ask but what I donâ€™t need after working away from home is to come home and go to Walmart spend my hard earned money just like everyone else to be stopped before exiting the store by some Walmart employee who thinks they the authority to stop me and go through what I just paid for with slip in hand. One thing I am not is a thief and they have the nerve to sop me or anyone else and treat them like they are stealing something. It is so embarrassing them going through your things. They have no right nor the authority to go through anyoneâ€™s things. Plus being followed through the store because your dirty from working all day and just because of the way a person looks they will follow you to see if youâ€™re stealing. Just so wrong and embarrassing. It makes me nervous going in Walmart anymore. I see a lawsuit happening! Just so disrespectful
3685,36191,NeilJ-HongKong,29/07/2018,Amazon Go,Literally Grab'n Go !!! This is constantly in the news so is well worth a visit. The store is actually quite small and expensive but its great to experience and understand what the future might look like.  Sit out with your lunch afterwards for a true amazon experience
3686,36267,Jeff B.,29/07/2018,Amazon Go,"I've seen the future of the convenience grocery business, and there's an app for it. This is about as easy as convenience shopping gets. But what I really like is that all of the three different salads we tried were excellent. Curry chicken salad with raisins was perfectly seasoned and delicious. Tasted like it was just made in the store ( I think it was ). The jerk chicken salad with avocado dressing was superb. A nice combo of sweet and tangy. Also very fresh. Same with the steak and salad. Like it just came off the grill and done medium. Prices are reasonable and you just leave. Nope, the cops didn't come after us. Very cool."
3687,42800,Shena,29/07/2021,Walmart,"Poor business plan. Each walmart manager does things THEIR way to exert their power over employees and vendors. Hard to keep up with 10 different sets of policies qhile vending at 10 diff walmarts in Moraine, Franklin and Centerville OH"
3688,42801,Ivan Lavotchin,29/07/2021,Walmart,Not good. Products have never arrived. Walmart is using FedEx for their shipping needs. FedEx is a crappy shipping company. Extremely unreliable.
3689,42802,Jason Russell,29/07/2021,Walmart,"This would be zero stars if that was an option. Iâ€™ve tried to order a set of tires on Walmart.com multiple times now in the last couple months. The first time one tire made it to the store and I was told to cancel and reorder. Of course the second order got stuck in â€œprocessingâ€ too and once again I was told to cancel so I took my business elsewhere. I needed some RV tires and had some Walmart gift cards so I figured Iâ€™d try again and just have them shipped to my house. Once again stuck in â€œprocessingâ€ and was told the only thing to do was cancel the order. I asked for the issue to be escalated and 10 minutes later I got an email saying my order had been canceled. No call, no conversation they just canceled the order without my permission. Tried reordering same thing the day of delivery, stuck in processing. Called in again, explained the situation and was told to cancel the order. i asked to talk to someone above first level support and was put on hold only to be told try calling the gift card number to see if theyâ€™ll give money for the gift card value. Hint they donâ€™t. Ordering system sucks, customer service sucks, if I didnâ€™t have the gift cards I would never do business with them again."

3691,42804,John MacArthur,29/07/2021,Walmart,"The Walmart + App is terrible. I tried it several times last month and every time my order was messed up in some fashion. Today however was the topper. I placed a $125 grocery order for delivery, selected the $10 express delivery and was charged $135 and change, which I paid. Approximately 1/2 hour before my designated deliver by time, I opened the app to track my order only to find out it wasnâ€™t there. It no longer existed. Mind you, I received my confirmation email, and another stating I had items substituted. So now, they have my money, I get no groceries, and had to argue for 3 hrs with customer service to finally be told Iâ€™ll get my money back in 3 to 5 business days. Do not use this app, itâ€™s complete garbage. If I could give zero or negative stars I would."

She went to eat the honey bun this morning and discovered it was expired on 7-22-22 ! Now they say they are stocking the store everyday so why was this still on the shelf for sale! People make sure that the food you buy from Walmart is not expired!
3694,40361,Amber Zimmerman,29/07/2022,Walmart,A large lady with short blue hair was working and when I walked right up to self checkout told me she was blocking off that entrance and I had to walk all the way around to the other side so â€œpeople wouldnâ€™t follow me and sheâ€™d have to let them in tooâ€. There was no one behind me. I told her I was already standing RIGHT THERE. And she was rude and wouldnâ€™t let me stay. Instead making me walk around. Worst customer service.
3695,40362,Susan Baker Megy,29/07/2022,Walmart,"If I could leave negative reviews, I would. Grocery delivery via horse and buggy would be faster and more efficient. Walmarts food delivery service is astoundingly horrific. Don't bother saving $$ with them. Your order will be canceled or never arrive. And customer service is reading from a script with absolutely no common sense."

She ended up hanging up on me while I was asking a question. I called Kill Devil Hills NC Walmart (****)and she answered on 3rd ring and answered my question with no problem.

3698,40365,Kwekusa,29/07/2022,Walmart,"I bought 3 monitors on sale from Walmart and was shipped 2weeks later and a notification came that the items are coming. The shipment finally and it was only one. I called the customer service and they confirmed that the shipment says a pack of 3 and nicely promised tto get back in 24hrs. I called back the next day and they contacted the seller and the response was they made a mistake with the price, they do not have the item in store and they do not carry those monitors anymore. Ironically the advert was still on and after i reminded them them they removed it. The annoying part of the deal was that they kept sending me email of the 3monitors and tracking information with the receipt showing the monitors and still denied. The Walmart customer service gave me false assurances and passed the blame to the error on the third party seller Triplenet. Sadly because I was getting 3 new monitors, I sold the other monitors very cheap and forced the guy to pick-up that morning as I have no space in my studio to store them. I got almost same deal from Amazon for 142.00 more. I like Walmart but the private sellers are getting them bad name. This is the second bad experience with Walmart"

If the items are selling maybe restock them? And donâ€™t you love when the store is packed and they only have 5 registers open but customer service agents will stand around in a pack and talk about their weekends plans and ignore everyone in line. I have finally gotten to a point I donâ€™t even care if it cost more I wonâ€™t shop at Walmart on principal. People will pay more for customer service people will stop shopping fir the lack of. But hey if you want your target base to be food stamps keep at it."
3701,46639,TorSpedIcey,30/07/2019,Walmart,"I worked for walmart for almost exactly one year. The people there in my crew were like family and I loved and still love them all, but management and corporate are the cruelest people I've ever met. Almost every day for that whole year I went home crying, wishing they'd just fire me already. Our store manager only ever focused on the stockers, while everyone in the back room were, at all times, the very last priority. We got paid the same but we were pushed to our very limits every day, and when we questioned him why our jobs kept getting more specific and harder constantly, his response would always be something along the lines of ""think of the bigger picture. If the stockers aren't doing all of this they get the products on the shelves faster"" but us doing that makes the process longer because we're getting the products out later, proving all any of them think about is the stockers. The stockers will do half their job sometimes and shove what they didn't feel like doing in the back room for the next day and the manager will get onto us for it. I know they do this because I have friends who stock, they never get in trouble and their jobs keep getting easier with more new policies. We're not allowed overtime but if we don't stay late we get coached and this applies to only the backroom (at least at store 622). I've overheard a woman talking with an associate telling her to leave early because she had 26 minutes of overtime, which is ridiculous. When we stay late busting our a**es they call us and tell us to come in late to cut our overtime, which we ""technically"" have a legal right to refuse, but if we do we get b****ed at. Lastly, I got fired for having too many points. I got called in the office and questioned about it. When I told them my doctor told me not to walk on my foot AT ALL but I've only been calling in the days it hurts very very bad, they then still proceeded to fire me. A guy in my crew had 4 more call ins than I had just a few weeks prior and he got his points completely removed, which shows me that they don't care about the points and they're showing favoritism."
3702,46640,Vivian T Oliva,30/07/2019,Walmart,"I have had a Walmart Credit card for few years. After starting my credit limit from $500 due to good payments on my part twice, without my asking for it, I received 2 increases from Walmart, for being a good customer I was told. I never defaulted on any payment and then just last month I decided to pay entire balance on all my credit cards including Walmart which I paid on June 18th to keep them clear and have them ready for the holidays. 1 month later a Credit Bureau alerts me Walmart closed my account asking if this was accurate. I never received a notice about my Walmart account being paid by the Credit Bureaus as they did all other cards congratulating me after those cards reported my payment. Walmart did not report mine with them as paid which helps my credit score. Instead Walmart alerted Bureaus that they made the choice to close out my account. That hurt my credit. I thought probably that I had not re-used the card again was the reason, although it had only been a month, so how could they close it for that. I contacted Walmart online to ask why and they said because I am no longer considered a holder with worthiness of their credit. I asked what does that mean and why? I was told first that I was wrong on live chat that the account was open and I said I just logged in and it says it has been closed I am looking right at it now, so right out of the gate they were getting their information incorrect. That person transferred me to another person and they said Walmart saw something on my credit report to another place that has nothing to do with them and decided I was no longer Worthy of their credit due to that information the credit bureau was giving them. They said it is their policy. They apologized for their decision. I asked, Doesn't credit history get considered prior to giving credit cards? I was given one and there was no issue then. I was worthy then but now that I have shown good payment history and finally paid every penny of it to bring total to $0 I am not worthy? I never received notice so they said notice is coming expect it in a few days. I was given a snipid of the letter online so I could see that is where I read the â€œWorthinessâ€ line. Then the live chat rep has the audacity to tell me to keep up with my payments. WHAT? Will I be charged a monthly/yearly fee? For a card I am no longer to have? I think this is injust and unfair to a good long term consumer. Not that my issue will make or break Walmart so please no rolling of the eyes at my notice as just another complaint in the massive amount I know Walmart receives. Consider things and look at it as humans with good business sense. How discriminatory and ridiculous is this? As I informed a few co-workers they showed me their cards and history and it is awful and one showed me she paid hers off over 6 months ago and she is a single mom with horrible credit yet her credit and account is still active. What is the criteria that resulted in my results? I understand this Is final but would like express myself and not expect a standard stupid response that deep down as you write it to me you damn well know it is ridiculous. Had I not paid off in full and just made my minimum payments made your decision different? Then I could have kept my account? What is this Walmart? All other credit cards I paid off sent me thanks and one increased my credit limit. Walmart decides this? No one else cared what my history shows now they just know they get good money from me and they wish to continue getting good money from me.  Disgusting, disgraceful, shameful, unfair and down-right dumb practices. Punish a consumer for what I might do in future based on what someone else said in a report. Something needs to be done to make sure this discriminatory practices do not continue."
3703,46641,Alan Honeycut,30/07/2019,Walmart,At the East Windsor store the shelves are empty of a great many things. This has been like this for some time. I asked a cashier if the store was closing and she said that they are missing a lot of product but she doesn't know why.
3704,46642,Mari Ka,30/07/2019,Walmart,"I had a most terrible experience in my life at Walmart King of Prussia, PA. Wallmart's employee did not accept the return of a new product to with receipt within five days of purchase, just because the box was open. Wallmart employee offered me to call the corporate number and provided me a phone number. I called this number and after 10 minutes of advertising, I was with an agent. The agent promissed me to help me with return. She started asking me my information (name, credit card, address) just for verification to help me with the return. at the end if our conversation, I was put on the automated machine where I was informed that I signed up for some shopping reward subscription. I started screaming that I donâ€™t need a subscription, I just needed help with the return. The call was ""magically disconnectedâ€ while I was frustrated, with two children, one despiretely crying. Wallmart employee with his colleague was starring and laughing at me. I told him I'd write a complaint, he started showing his name tag , saying, ""Go ahead! I will be donating the mattresses, but I want everyone to know that they are poor low quality and the smell is suffocate, and in my case, the employee declined to proceed with return. â€œIntex 8.75"" Classic Downy Inflatable Airbed Mattressâ€. I will never ever buy anything from Walmart and I spread the world as much as I can about my terrible experience."

3706,46644,Tasha,30/07/2019,Walmart,Felicia the supervisor to Walmart was so rude very unhelpful and very unprofessional. I was sold the wrong phone card by a wal-mart employee all I wanted was the right card not my money back. She wasnâ€™t even trying to help me. She just keep doing her work. But Andy another supervisor at least try to help. Smh poor customer service

There were people just walking around freely without one. how do you even enter without one? what's the employees doing at the front door? what is the priority of walmart? (Safety) stopping the spread of the virus or (Their money) fearing to lose customers that wont do it!!! Nobody wants to really wear them, but you go along with it because we are suppose to be in this together."
3708,44752,The Eternals,30/07/2020,Walmart,"Worst decision of my life. The best decision of my life was going to ECPI University, and the worst is for sure working at da Mart. Customer service is terrible, the workers are atrocious to talk to and look at, the managers donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re talking about and their products are horrible! Saying this though, they do give me that dough and 11.50/hour ainâ€™t half bad so I canâ€™t complain too much. In conclusion, I hate Walmart, but I love Walmart."

Never shopping at Walmart again!!!
3710,44754,Virginia,30/07/2020,Walmart,"For a ""SUPER CENTER"", Mansfield Hackettstown bombs! No sanitizing agents on the shelves for months! Big holes in a lot of grocery shelves. A few almost rotten bananas in produce! This is Wednesday, not Monday when I would expect these conditions after weekend crowds. Other local grocery chains don't seem to have as much of a problem keeping stocked."
3711,36156,65oski,30/07/2019,Amazon Go,"couldn't get in Basically a small food store with lots of prepared items and a lot of high technology. You download the Amazon Go app to your phone, scan it when you enter, pick out the items you want and leave. Within a few minutes the receipt shows up on your phone. Prices are reasonable, selection is limited. I asked how they check the age of those purchasing beer and wine. They have a clerk do it manually, so it's not completely automated yet."

Walmart says its the sellers problem. Seller says its the shippers problem. UPS says its the sellers problem. It has now been 8months. The product never arrived. No one is willing to provide the product or a refund. So I am just out of my hard earned money. While the order still says delayed. The tracking doesn't help, the product made it to within 16miles of my house and disappeared. Walmart Online IS NOTHING BUT A FANCY WAY TO SCAM PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR MONEY. They DON'T want costumers just the money.if I could give less than 1 star I would."

3715,42799,George Hank Karas,30/07/2021,Walmart,My experience with walmart.com has not been good. One instance i ordered something and never got it. So i had to contact walmart.com(they didn't even communicate with me that the order was delayed or if it got lost or what) and get my money back. On another two instances i wanted to do a return several items. On both they said i have for example 7-28 to take it back. So for example i took it back to the store and said i want to return the item. Customer said. Sorry you should have brought it back 30 days after the purchase. Kinda contradicts themselves. Walmart.com said i could return it and customer service at the store said no.So after contacting customer service they said they would send me verification in my email to get my money back and return the item. Never heard from them.Walmart.com doesn't hold a candle to amazon let alone another troubled company like ebay. Walmart.com im staying away from you because you don't know what you are doing and you are a terrible company.

3717,40358,Carol Strobel,30/07/2022,Walmart,"I went to super walmart the other day. I found a rack that was $1.00 items, i found 8 items for that price but the cashier rang them up and the price came up $12.98 or $10.98 so i said no. I said to her the price says $1.00 and that's what i want them for. I went back and took a picture of the rack showing $1.00 and the items on the rack. She called a manager over and i showed the picture and she went back to look. She took a while to come back so i went back to see what she was doing. To my surprise she was calling another worker over to take all the items away from the rack. So i went back to cashier and said she is taking all the items off that rack but i still want mine for $1.00 cuz thats there fault. Another manager came over and they were talking and the one came back from the rack and said i can only have one for the $1.00 amount. I was like how about 2 of them cashier said no the manager said one ,i said i want your names cuz someone will hear about this .The names i got were cashier Nayelis, 2nd manager Kenji. 1st manager Adrian who had someone take the clothes off the rack after i tried to purchase the 8 items but only was aloud one which is bull i should have gotten mine for a $1,00 amount . I want my 7 items they wouldn't give me !"
3718,40359,Britt,30/07/2022,Walmart,I pay for Walmart plus every month and think it should be cheaper. Also tired of dealing with agents via chat that don't want to help or are rude. I tried doing a return for an item from a past order that had a 90 day return policy. The 90 days was up 5 days ago. The item ended up only working less then a handful of times. I reached out and they said nothing they can do since return window has passed. After arguing they only gave me 25% refund back for a $46 item. Seriously???? And the item was faulty like I said! As much $ Walmart makes and as much as I spend there plus paying for + every month you think they'd be kind enough to still do a return for a FULL refund. Companies and their egos/$. Walmart needs to do a lot better.
3719,40360,Michael Scott,30/07/2022,Walmart,"bought set of dinnerware from Walmart. Com. When I opened the box their were several broken.

Effective mid-october they signed a new contract with Capital One to manage their credit cards. Interest rate.....wait....25.15%.

Another large corporation putting the screws to American customers."
3726,46684,DAVID,31/07/2019,Walmart,I just did my grocery shopping at Walmart on Southwest Dr in Abilene Tx and was harassed by two Walmart employees as I was using the self checkout. One started telling me I missed items and then called another employee over so both could stand over each shoulder until I finished checkout. I asked them if they wanted to check it and they quickly said no. I spend hundreds of thousands of dollars at Walmart year after year. I have not been made feel like a criminal until today. If this is the way Walmart is going to conduct business now I'll go somewhere else and Walmart you just lost a loyal customer.

3729,44746,Karen S,31/07/2020,Walmart,"Why Walmart wonâ€™t get my delivery service again. When you order online some items can only be picked up at the store. You get a message saying item is ready. You have to walk in and scan your item. Sometimes the irem is delivered to you through the machine. Sometimes in a locker bear the kiosk and sometimes they have to have someone deliver it to you. Today, mine was delivered to me by a person. After 10 minutes and no person arriving I scanned again. Waited 10 more minutes and called the store to see what the hold up was. Had I not ordered online, I could have picked it up, paid and been out the door. My time is more valuable than waiting for someone to do work that I could have done faster myself. Online ordering does not save customers time."
3730,44747,William H Bell,31/07/2020,Walmart,"I received an email today saying someone went on the Walmart Online and tried to use my Walmart credit card to make a purchase. Luckily I didn't have enough in my account for it to go through so the email stated ""purchase decline for insufficient funds"" so I called the number on the back of the card and took care of having Capitol One cancel the card and then went on the Walmart.com and changed my password. I call Walmart customer service to see if I can find out what they tried to purchase and if anything where they were making that purchase from. So after having to listen to a long drawn out automated voice for a good 5 minutes I finally get a human. I explained why I was calling and the steps I have already taken. She asked for the credit card number so I gave it to her, three times because it was obvious she couldn't understand me and couldn't understand what I was inquiring about. So I asked for a supervisor. Another 10 minutes gone by and I get Paula. I again explained the situation and she asked for my credit card number. After the second time she says that maybe I need to speak to Walmart Grocery to see if any denied transactions showed up there. Here's what I learned. Walmart is not prepared to handle fraud actions. When calling customer service there is no option of ""disputing a transaction"" or even a ""if you believe someone was using your card with no authorization"". No you get a bunch of babble from the automated voice when you first call then more babble by the reps and supervisor. After being told by the supervisor that she could not access the ""grocery"" side of Walmart I explained how ridiculous that is that a manager doesn't have access to all the customers info and transaction regardless of what department. So I said go ahead and transfer me to grocery and then I was hung up on. I never raised my voice, or used foul language. Just hung up on by a Walmart manager. I think Walmart and I are done doing business."

She even got double charged for other items with an obvious self scan error! Stay away from this scam! We actually wanted to buy all the items we picked out in the store! The lady was trying to help us with all the items working there but apparently we had missed something even though she said we are all set! We are teachers and have never stolen in our lives!

I guess as I don't know how that feels exactly. Well, you will pay after 30 mins exiting the store though as the app will send you the receipt.

3737,42792,Cheyenne McConnell,31/07/2021,Walmart,"I recently purchased patio furniture. It came to me missing more than half of the items. I called customer service, and was told I would be receiving a full refund and the missing parts, due to the amount of missing. I have all the screws, and the back boarding of my furniture. Iâ€™m missing cushions, arms, and a whole coffee table.  For the missing parts, the agent Angel I talked to, put in his notes, that I donâ€™t have a car (which I do?) so I donâ€™t cant return it and noted that I didnâ€™t want a refund BUT I said that I prefer not to return the whole item because I didnâ€™t want to wait for another four weeks of getting a product that should have been fulfilled the first time and I would like to be sent missing parts. In no way did I ever mention a car. The customer service Angel, replied that I will be receiving a full refund for the inconvenience and be sent the missing parts. I asked him about four times about the refund because I wanted to make sure thatâ€™s what he said and he said that it would be in my account in a week.  I called customer service again this morning, when I saw the notes about my missing parts because it said I would receive only 60 dollars as compensation and that I donâ€™t have a car so I canâ€™t return the whole item, which again not true. The person Patrick I talked just this morning belittled me and talked to me like I was stupid. I explain that the notes that were written were not accurate and he argued for 10 minutes with me saying that the third party seller was trying to help me in giving me that 60 dollar compensation, and that in no way would they give full refunds unless if I return the item. I was very upset the way he was taking to me, I was trying to tell him what happened and he dismissed me and said that thereâ€™s nothing in the notes... THATS WHY IM CALLING BECAUSE THE NOTES WRITTEN BY THE OTHER CUSTOMER CARE SERVICE ARE INACCURATE. Yes the third party was â€œgenerousâ€ for the 60 dollar compensation. As Patrick said to me but This set was over 400 dollars and it came to me missing half of it and itâ€™s about to get discontinued. If it came to me missing, then itâ€™s going to come to you with missing parts, and at this rate Iâ€™ll still get charged for not sending back all the pieces (because I donâ€™t have them!) Mistakes happen but when Iâ€™m talked to the way that I was just talked to by a customer service representative, when I was just wanting clarification from why it went to full refund to only 60 dollars, and why the notes said I didnâ€™t have a car to return it because that statement was so odd, itâ€™s not right."
3738,42793,BD,31/07/2021,Walmart,"I am very dissatisfied with Walmarts customer service. I purchased some shoes online, they were sent in a bag not a box. From looking at the shoes through the bag, I knew that they were overpriced and looked like they wouldnt last. So i brought them into Walmart to return them, they said they must be in a box. So i suggested that since they are Walmart they must have an empty box to use, she said they werent up front but in the back, so i told her i would go get it she said no employees only, and didnt even agree to get it so i could return the item.. So I called customer service twice.. both representatives proceeded to tell me they couldnt hear me, and I caught one in a lie because he did respond, but then said he couldnt hear me again in order to not resolve my issue., so shoes i dont intend to wear they didnt offer me a prepaid label to return. I will never shop at walmart or online, its really unprofessional service.."
3739,42794,Shelby Still,31/07/2021,Walmart,"You started out so well and I now assume you just couldn't keep up with quality online / pick-up service. Otherwise, you wouldn't have deleted a large number of products that are no longer available for grocery pick-up to loyal Walmart shoppers. More disgusting is the fact that most items that are no longer available for pick-up are common items that are much needed. Make up your mind - you can't have it both ways. Are you going to offer full-service, quality online pick-up, or NOT?! What a HUGE let down. I'm sure you won't mind losing a few loyal shoppers; (after-all) it won't put a dent in your enormous profits or success. That (in itself) says a lot about your company. You really should make this right."
3740,42795,Ezpz,31/07/2021,Walmart,"Horrible!  Ordered 4 jugs of cat litter. When they arrived via fedx, one jug was missing a lid and had spilled out into the box. Plus, fed x left the boxes out in the rain with no plastic covering.  What a mess to clean up! Not to mention that my cat thought he had a new litter box so I needed to clean the clumpy mess quickly. And my white pants turned gray and white! Ugh!  I called customer service and the lady offered either a replacement or refund. I chose the replacement, only to see both on the Walmart site and the confirmation email that I was being charged for the replacement!  I called again and the person assured me that I was not being charged. Itâ€™s just the way the system had to do it.  Well, the next day, I looked at my credit card account, and not only was I being charged for the replacement item; there was a pending charge in the full amount of the original order! This was in addition to the completed charge of the original order!  I called again and the third person I spoke with said she would notify finance and it would be resolved. I did get a confirmation email that a refund for the one jug had been initiated.  I will check my account tomorrow and notify my financial institution that a second Walmart charge in the same amount as the original order was NOT authorized.  This was an awful experience on so many levels that I will no longer shop at Walmart- not the store, not online. Iâ€™d rather pay a little more than undergo this stress again."
3741,42796,Trennette Gilbert,31/07/2021,Walmart,If I could give zero stars I would. Customer service for Walmart.com sucks. I placed an order for pickup at a local store and it was supposed to be ready for pickup today at 12:30 pm. Itâ€™s now 9:57 pm and itâ€™s still being prepared and Iâ€™m on the phone cursing out this poor guy because he canâ€™t tell me why my order is not ready. DO NOT ORDER FROM WALMART.COM!!! You would be better off just going to the store or better yet going to Target. The customer service is much better there.
3742,42816,Julie marisca,31/07/2021,Walmart,"Another one star experience. Bought a NEW text online. They sent me a used tent all jammed into a box with sand still inside the carrying bag. NEVER should anyone buy something online from Walmart. By the way it came in an Amazon Box and the shipper was Achieve Medical LLC. They left the sand in the bag, rolled it up and jammed it into the package and sold it to me. Then the solution by Achieve Medical LLC, the company that shipped it said I can return it or they would give me $15. So is that how they dispose of used tents? They sold one to me, essentially they advertised a NEW product and sold me a used one then offered me $15, instead of saying ""USED"" tent for sale for a $15 discount. Is this happening to others?"

3745,40354,Carolyn Seal,31/07/2022,Walmart,"I waited in line for 30 min and when I had a simple yes or no question to ask. An employee walking behind the register appeared so I asked him. He said he didn't work there (when I've seen him there working multiple times, so he could tell me if they make photo copies). It's extremely rude to be ignored by a person obviously on duty. I wasted 45 min of my day to just not be helped."

But the supposed manger coach Seem's to be abit angry his self. I go there everyday and everyday I buy something, sometimes twice a day. And Everytime that person is there they look like they want something to happen. I believe that they want a reason to cry. In which would involve a lawsuit against you because if something did happen trust they would sue you. I don't know why or what the cause of the problem is. All I know is that I don't bother anyone unless it's important to know a price or help with a question in which to purchase. In which I have done so. That there's camera's all you have to do is look. I'm telling you fact of what I know and have seen. It happens everyday now. So choose to believe what you want and hopefully it won't end badly."

3754,36397,Chris S.,13/08/2018,Amazon Go,"It's confusing at first, but rule of thumb is that if it feels like you're shoplifting, you're doing it right. Amazon Go isn't a full grocery store (the technology can't handle by-weight produce, for example) - imagine if 7-11 and Whole Foods had a baby. Download the app to get in and log in with your amazon.com account. You'll get the same payment options you use when you're shopping like it's the '00s. Scan a QR code, walk in, pick up what you want, and leave. You're being tracked by artificial intelligence fed by weight sensors under the food and more cameras than Caesar's Palace. Bear in mind that products are billed to whoever takes them off the shelf - if you hand something to your friend who buzzed in with their own account, you'll still pay for it. If you put something BACK on the shelf and your friend grabs it, they will pick up the tab. One nifty feature is that your receipt (when it does arrive) actually clocks how long you were in the store. I was able to see that it took me less than 20 seconds to grab and pay for a Red Bull this afternoon. The future is now!"

3756,42726,Disappointed and disillusioned,13/08/2021,Walmart,"Please be aware that if you buy a product from Walmart, it may be sold to the store by a 3rd party. I purchased a Nordic treadmill and was delivered an older model of the treadmill. It was false advertising on Walmart's part as they listed the Nordic treadmill model as the newer one. When I called customer service, I was told to contact the 3rd party seller to return the model. It took many phones, including one to the Walmart headquarters to begin to return something I did not order. What appeared to be a good deal turned out to be a major headache. Very disappointing! I will no longer be purchasing products from Walmart."

So I call Walmart, to be told subcontractors are delivering and making horrible mistakes. Someone will get back to me.

This individual acted like a thug, he put his hands on my wife and my 2 boys. Long story short he had me falsely arrested, we spent $400 and this joke of a human being said I stole. When I went to court the matter had to be dismissed because Walmart provided no evidence of my alleged theft. I have filed complaints with the company and they don't seem to, care.This piece of garbage is still working there even though he assaulted a women and 2 toddlers. I am looking into filing a lawsuit in this matter.."

Well Im not the one who messed up the order.they were the one who messed it up!!

3770,44672,Jessica Bucco,14/08/2020,Walmart,"I will never order from Walmart online ever again. I ordered online for an in-store pick up and all it has done is cost me time. I went to pick up my online order at my local Walmart, Thinking it would be quick and easy and 45 minutes later I walked out without the items I ordered. This is your only brought out one item from my order and I asked him where my other item was and he was clueless. He told me to hold on and he went and got a general manager and they couldnâ€™t figure out if the item was in the store, being shipped to the store, or is out of stock completely. They asked me to go about my day and they would have the manager call me. The manager never called me I had to call her. After I spoke with her and she had no idea where the item was I had to call The one 800 number. The gentleman from a one 800 number told me it would be two weeks for the item to be delivered. I asked for a refund because I ordered the item I anticipated that it was available for in-store pick up. He told me no problem and he would refund me. Several weeks go by and I check my Discover card and I have not received my $50 refund. So I have to call again to the 1-800 Number, go through all the prompts and wait on hold to hopefully get a refund. So all this time and energy and phone calls and trip to Walmart for an item I never got.... but I got charged for, and a refund I was supposed to get but Iâ€™m still waiting on. I will never order online from Walmart again. Back in March I placed a large order for my baby shower. Walmart canceled the order because of a mixup with the address and never ever texted me or emailed me so I had no idea the order was not in transit"

A glimpse inside: shiny floors, lots of high-end convenience store foods.  BUT a turnstile to get in and you needed a certain app on your phone to get through it. We didn't have the app. We didn't have a phone. We couldn't go in.  A kindly man near the entrance explained this to us, but also said he wasn't an Amazon employee. There were no Amazon employees. That's kind of the point.  Quite understand why the app is needed. Still disappointed. Note to self and others: get the app before going."

She actually told me she didn't have their extentions. Finally someone showed up, said not one word, opened the case. I left without purchasing what I wanted because the cross did not come with a chain. I blame the management and the company. The company makes enough money to staff their store. But who cares really.

In addition to clothing, my WALMART is a full-service department store with a large supermarket and a SUBWAY sandwich shop!"

It's to the point where I don't even want to go there anymore. Something needs to change. Maybe the person in charge or managers idk but this is ridiculous. That and Everytime I'm there their return policy changes. It depends on the can and the service counter that's there on that day. Nobody follows the correct return policy. And managers are rude cussing out customers and employees. This place is a truly horrible customer service and they have no appreciation for the employees there.

The employee checking me out had such a horrible attitude like I said I am a young girl with not a lot of money so I had to pay with ones when I handed her the ones she looked at me with disgust and told me that me handing this to her was disrespectful and offensive because they were a little wrinkled I apologized I said sometimes in the wallet I have they get that way and I tried my best to flatten them neatly and she told me that was no excuse. I walked out of there pretty sad because it just felt like I was being scolded and attacked for no reason. Once again this was at the Deptford Walmart in New Jersey and the workers name was cancella. I feel bad leaving this kinda of review but I have really bad anxiety and was just in shock at the way she handled things. As a worker for a fast food place I would never say that to anyone when handling money because I do not know their situation.
3789,44670,bart,15/08/2020,Walmart,I placed order online few days ago everything was fine. today I placed another order and before I got order confirmation I got cancellation first. I tried to talk to half brainers via chat no answer why it happened. I tried to re order few hours later same crap. another idiot who was clueless. I called the phone line customer service. after 20 minutes fine went dead. no resolution . money has been authorized from my card twice and I have for the funds to be released after the weekend . what a bull crap service. and I still have no option to how to order it.
3790,42717,Alexis Webster,15/08/2021,Walmart,I have been a Walmart shopper for years recently I needed to go get a Covid test Covid tests are free but not at Walmart in the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic Walmart figured out a way to make even more money to charge people for a free test and the cost of a home kit is $125 last I heard Walmart was tryingTo help fight the pandemic not increase their bottom line but as you can see like everything else itâ€™s all about the almighty dollar Iâ€™d like to know how if the president said Covid testing is free still free why is Walmart charging
3791,42718,Janet Brinegar,15/08/2021,Walmart,I WISH I DIDNâ€™T HAVE TO GUVE ANY STARS FOR THIS PLACE! I will NEVER buy groceries from walmart again!! I ordered groceries online and picked them up only to find that I did not receive all my groceries and was charged for them. When I called I was told that I would have to wait 7 business days to receive a refund. I WILL be shopping at Kroger now. I would rather pay more and get what I ordered than deal with walmart. Good job walmart! You just lost a customer and Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not the first person to have had this issue. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
3792,42719,Mary,15/08/2021,Walmart,"Use to never have a problem with orders on walmart.com. Lately several of my orders were not delivered to my home like they were supposed to be, they were delivered elsewhere. Post office manager suspected mail fraud for a Blackstone I ordered from walmart.com and never received. Can never seem to get my cases of water delivered to my home it is delivered elsewhere...not very happy with walmart.com lately. They need to watch out for some of their third party vendors that walmart is getting their items from for fraud and such."
3793,42720,Lorrisa Loomis,15/08/2021,Walmart,"If I could give it less stars I would. Their delivery services are never in time, canceled or delayed is a regular thing. Most of what they deliver isn't even from Walmart so returns are a nightmare. Even store pick up is getting insane, delayed or canceled when they are fully stocked in what is in your order! Do yourself a favor and order Amazon."
3794,40209,Maribel S,15/08/2022,Walmart,"WORST CS EVER IN NC. WALMART reps are from another country not knowing anything or how the system is ""delayed"" and not updating properly. I have spoken to three people this weekend and nothing has been resolved nor is the items being reordered to go out for delivery and driver is too lazy to call as per instructions added on order. Why as for instructions if DRIVER WONT FOLLOW. WORST WALMART EVER."
3795,40211,Admin Gal,15/08/2022,Walmart,"I would give a zero if I could! Walmart is no longer able to fulfill deliveries for curb side or delivery, all three times, they finally sent an email that it will be delayed! This time I was there and the worker told Meir will be delayed by five hours so it would cancel for today, they are going downhill fast! Noticed their Facebook page is on pauseðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬"
3796,40213,tracy,15/08/2022,Walmart,walmart employees at walmart in abq nm on academy are impolite aggressive and very rude they order you to put your basket right they aggressivley take reciept out of your hands with out any warning to make sure you didnt steal anything the way they the operate is so insensitive i go next door to smiths now do to walmarts aggressive employee campaign
3797,40214,Satisfied Customer,15/08/2022,Walmart,"Holly Springs, NC Walmart Pharmacy. Never shopping at Walmart have I honestly had a great experience, until I was waited on by Amber. Certified Pharmacy Tech. This young lady was the epitome of what customer service should be. She was pleasant and bright.â€ She never once sighed or roll her eyesâ€ like the usual Walmart employee. Kudos to her!!!!!!!"
3798,40215,MichaelaS,15/08/2022,Walmart,"Walmart Customer service is horrible, the make commitments via phone the do not keep. I ordered a few items from Walmart to be shipped to me.part of the items are to be delivered via FedEx and the others through the store. This is day three I am waiting for school supplies to be delivered to my home. I heard all kinds of excuses but still Walmart doesnâ€™t seem to get it handled to get my items delivered. They make commitments they do not keep. Horrible."
3799,40217,Sabre,15/08/2022,Walmart,"This website is absolutely terrible. If you fail to spend 35 bucks or more, you get charged a ""less than minimum"" fee of 6.99 which is just their ""legal"" way or robbing you blind. I really do not recommend this website, you're better off going in the store in person so you don't pay out the *** in fees. NOT recommended one bit!"
3800,40232,Misty Witter,15/08/2022,Walmart,"Would give it a zero if I could. Was on the free trial and only got 1 out of 3 orders delivered (my very 1st one). The other 2 we're ""delayed"" and had to be cancelled. Walmart has gone to poop since Mr Sam Walton died!! I'm sure he's rolling over in his grave"
3801,40263,Zerochaos,15/08/2022,Walmart,"Hopefully Walmart reads this and cares. Many items do not have prices. More and more items are behind locked cases with no one to help get the merchandise or even see a barcode to scan a price. Examples: motor oil and shotgun shells. The result is that I will do 25% as much purchasing at Walmart this year as I have averaged for the past 10-15. The automotive area has become terribly managed. So much so that there isn't AC or decent working conditions for the mechanics and customers cannot trust the work. Quality of Walmart brand items was once the same as name brands. The quality has plunged. Ex: Oil of olay, cereals, many, many other knock-offs. Many items are not in stock or not in stock consistently. Ex: lawn care supplies, bird feed, glues, paints."
3802,40264,Lule Burrow,15/08/2022,Walmart,"This Review is for the Germantown, MD Walmart. Very rude and unhelpful people at this Walmart. The supervisor screamed at me after getting my curbside pickup order wrong and refused to give me a refund while I waited in the car with my 4 young children. I ended up going inside after calling and them purposely hanging up for a prank or something. I went to the customer service desk and asked who hanged up the phone and they all started to laugh and giggle. After that the â€œsupervisorâ€ ran to the back and slammed the door after claiming that I harassed her. What is the point of curbside pickup when they get your order wrong and refuse to take you item and exchange it while you wait. These people need to have proper training in customer service because I was treated unfairly and unjust."
3803,40272,JENNIFER HALL,15/08/2022,Walmart,This is the worst offline purchase I've ever made! The camp collectors were so slow and low quality that my family and I waited in line for three hours!

I went to customer service today to buy the 24 case of can cat food the price on the shelf said $11.99 but it rung up $15.32 ,I told the cashier and she said oh you have to take a picture and I told her why do I have to do that when you can walk over there or she could have called one of 4 workers that was just walking around on they cell phone she told me ""I'm not a cashier so I can't leave here""no one was on line but me. The store lines would be at about 7 to 10 people each only on 2 lanes that's open. I'm going to use the walmart in Athens ga. For now on even though I live in Commerce.

3808,47276,James Southern Jr,16/08/2016,Walmart,"I shop at our local Wal-mart supercenter and love the idea of going in and getting everything i need in one place, ..... but ... Their prices are creeping up to the point that many of the stores around them are now cheaper (prices) than they are. and when I have to stand in line for over 20 mins to check out 15 things (makes you want to just put them down & walk out) but I'll keep going back cause they do have the bigest selection of stuff anywhere. Oh and never a hassle if you have to return something. ONE STOP SHOPPING"
3809,46592,Kathy Taylor,16/08/2019,Walmart,"Unbelievable, jewelery scam! Do NOT buy gold jewelry from Walmart. They will NOT provide warranty coverage, even with purchase of extended warranty. For over 3 years I have been receiving calls and emails from customers in this position. They are being told to contact Simply Gold directly to pursue warranty coverage. Unfortunately, I am NOT the right company. I have NEVER been a supplier to Walmart. Please do not buy ANYTHING from their jewellery department."
3810,46593,Steven White,16/08/2019,Walmart,"I recently placed an online order on their website. When I called their customer service after a few hours to make a change to my order I got a ""Rep"" with all the English speaking skills of a 3 year old. A simple change that should only have taken a mere seconds turned into into 30 minutes of frustration. I'm all for equal opportunity for ""qualified"" people. This does not speak well at all to Walmart's so called commitment to customer service. If you put someone in in a customer service position, make sure they can communicate effectively!"
3811,46594,Tim Crowder,16/08/2019,Walmart,I always get what I expect from Walmart. - Subpar customer service - Low-quality products - Low prices
3812,46595,Kay North,16/08/2019,Walmart,Walmart has the worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with. I ordered from them recently and received one box of smashed glass bowls which had been sent without any protective wrapping and a second box half filled with opened liquid detergent. I have contacted them many times but have received NO HELP with either of these issues. I will NEVER deal with them again.
3813,44661,Allan Phillips,16/08/2020,Walmart,"Walmart corporate are disgusting people I could not believe that I guys are supporting blm and demonizing the police in the name of the Al mighty Dollar me and my wife have decided your company will not get anymore of our money. I have no respect for a company that supports looters, racists and murderers. You have crossed a line that you should not have crossed like I previously stated absolutely disgusting."
3814,44662,Katherine Burke,16/08/2020,Walmart,"I will never order from Walmart again. I ordered an item on July 20, 2020 and it was out for delivery July 29, 2020. Today is August 16, 2020 and still no delivery! I have contacted customer service 4 times & no answers. They certainly charged me for the item I didnâ€™t receive, and they will not credit my card. Horrible service Walmart!!"
3815,44663,Russell,16/08/2020,Walmart,"I have tried placing an online order for local pickup several times over the past few months. Every single time, I end up getting a message that the item isnâ€™t available and my order has been canceled â€” even though it was in stock when I placed the order. It has happened enough times that I pledge to never EVER rely on Walmart again to fulfill any order. I will not be attempting this again. And today I even had the assistance from a customer service representative, who assured me my items would be available for pickup. Never again. I hate to say it but Target never has this problem."

I was about to leave with such excitement as a customer, once I took it up to the front JESSICA a idk what kind of team member said it wasnâ€™t messed up when it clearly was an I got told I was getting 10% off. She didnâ€™t care about how me an my brother were waiting patiently and TOLD FOR WORD I would get a discount. Jessica ruined my day an my brothers birthday."
3817,42712,Kevin Hartung,16/08/2021,Walmart,Had daughters oil changed in her car. She drove approximately 20 miles and engine went to crap. Blew motor. Checked oil when I went to get Car only had a quart in it. No signs of leak or spraying out. Note vehicle 2011 Chevy impala 6 cylinder 3800 i believe. Mechanics at Walmart are not even certified Mechanics is out of the mangers mouth that i dealt with.

3819,42714,Lynn Brook,16/08/2021,Walmart,"I bought a phone from Walmart. Com , that was sold by Wombat Reserve they sent me an excellent Samsung Galaxy Note 9 , and shipped it 2nd day air.

3820,42715,Kim Stevens,16/08/2021,Walmart,"For store hours 4 stars, personnel 3 stars website 2 stars and phone support 1 star. But overall I give Walmart and the Walton Family 0 stars because they have done nothing in 50 years to increase their customer loyalty or appreciation and especially because they have never taken an offer at the local level to donate to a worthy cause. They will never see the customer they will only see the dollar sign #CAPICHE"
3821,42716,Thomas Higgins,16/08/2021,Walmart,I bought a door knocker through Walmart but it turned out to be Joybuy .I never received it .it's been weeks and they will not refund my money you should be ashamed Walmart.
3822,40204,Ismael Lujan,16/08/2022,Walmart,My son's birthday is coming up and I bought him a printer which was on sale. I wrapped it up and sent it to him in Tennessee. He tried it and said it wasn't OK and for me to return it. He sent it back to me and the customer service desk said it had been 38 days since I bought it so I can't return it now. Then they wonder why their rating is so low. And all I can do with the printer is throw it away. Ridiculous
3823,40205,Carol,16/08/2022,Walmart,"I ordered three different items and each of them is not what the post said. For example two of the items were supposed to be 100% cotton, they sent something like the dresses I ordered, but they were both in all Rayon. The other dress I ordered said it's color was purple, but they sent me pink. I wrote to them several times now and I've gotten no response or replacements. I will NOT shop online with them ever again!!!"
3824,40220,Cole,16/08/2022,Walmart,"Walmart Rosemead is the WORST curbside pick up location for groceries. Waited for an hour and half but our groceries never came. I called them 2x times to follow up. First call, I was put on hold and the lady was VERY RUDE. The second call I let her know she put me on a 10 min hold and asked where my order is. Everyone getting thereâ€™s but not mine. We were so patient to wait an hour and half but we got nothing. Such a bad customer service. Not even a â€œsorry for the inconvenience or whatsoeverâ€. We ended up leaving and cancelling."
3825,40221,Judith Majette,16/08/2022,Walmart,"A big shout out for a remarkable young man named Darren at Walmart, Store 615, in Cartersville, GA!!! He was working the early evening shift at the Self-Checkout near the Grocery side. He demonstrated exceptional customer service and conducted himself in a very courteous and professional manner. He is definitely a ""people"" person who could very well be a leader who others can depend on to get the job done! Very impressed with his attention and interaction to us and other customers. Walmart is very lucky to have this employee representing them!!!!!!"

So I walk out and her lazy ass can move the stuff to help someone 2nd in line .Customer service ? Called em twice cause the first time I complained I was offered no reference #. I called back to add to complaint there wasn't one. The games they play and think we a stupid. Call ask for a super or management and get put on hold till you say f it and go shop elsewhere cause they don't care if you spend money there. They will get paid the same either way. Shop USA not walmart!!!!!
3827,40267,HT,16/08/2022,Walmart,"Using Walmart+ at Murphey's gas is impossible. First, you need to sign on to Walmart Website, but there is NO WiFi coverate at the pump. Therefore, you must go inside the Walmart store to get a WiFi connection so you can sign on. Getting a WiFi connection inside the store is iffy. It seems like their WiFi is off and on. Then when you do sign on, you are given a six digit number you need to input in the pump before you start pumping the gas. A majority of the time the pump says the number you entered is invalid, try again. Upon several attempts to input the number, I just give up and go ahead and buy gas at the non discounted price. I would like a full refund on the appprox. $100 annual membership fee that I paid. But, I'm sure that is an impossibility. So don't waste you money for the membership fee. It isn't worth it."
3828,46588,Anastasia Afan,17/08/2019,Walmart,"We had a very bad experience with online order!!! We ordered a full bedroom set for $845 on July 31st, they took off the money from my debit card and told us on August 12th around 3pm we will receive this shipment to our address, they never came, I called them what happened and they told me looks like the item is still getting prepared and told us to give them 2 more days to get it shipped or next week. On Saturday I called and told them what is the process and they told me itâ€™s still getting prepared and then told me this item is out of stuck actually so we would need to cancel this item.... are you frikin serious?!!!! We already paid for this item, it never says on their website that it wasnâ€™t out of stuck. So anyway I canceled and they told me they will return the money within 5 business days! I hope this will happen or else you better run! So yeah donâ€™t waste your time on ordering online at this not professional store. If I never called them they would of never let us know that this item is out of stuck and we would of lost the money. Very very bad experience!"

3833,44660,Dgray,17/08/2020,Walmart,"Donâ€™t bother. What a joke this next day â€˜serviceâ€™ is. I need some essentials and decided to try Walmart instead of amazon. It was a bit cheaper than amazon, and I wouldnâ€™t have to actually go into the store. I made sure to only choose next day items, which in some cases were different sizes or brands than the ones I wanted. It said I ordered too late Saturday to get them Sunday, so Iâ€™d get them Monday. Ok. No problem. Then Sunday I get an email saying my shipment would be here next week! Now I have to go to the store anyway, and next week Iâ€™ll have extra items in larger sizes or brands than I wanted. Great.  Contacted customer support. Very nice. But he said there were a few broken or missing items so they moved my whole order up a week.  Never mind, Walmart. You canâ€™t compete with Amazon, apparently."

I had Amazon app on my phone a d thatâ€™s what everyone entering Amazon Go needs to have in order to buy something. After activating my app, a QR code appeared on the screen which I used to scan at the entry to enter small gate. I grabbed a sandwich and walked out the gate. That was it. It later sent me a receipt to my email. At the exit area, there condiments, tap water, cups, napkins, etc. It was fun, but not sure I like it! First of, a lot of people will their jobs because of this kind of technology, which I donâ€™t want to support. Less human interactions with each other only turn us to alienate each other! We have enough people on this planet who are willing to work to support themselves, unless everything is free. I hope this system is not a new norm to how we shop soon."

3837,42707,Jamie Hopkins,17/08/2021,Walmart,"Terrible. I ordered a 15$ 5qt bottle of motor oil. They send me 3 5qt bottles of the wrong motor oil. Cannot use it..I contact them and they tell me I have to return the motor oil in order to get my refund. I tell them I will leave the package for FedEx (something I have done with other companies). They tell me no and I have to return it. I explain the reason I order online is that the nearest Walmart is 42 minutes away. They tell me ""sorry for the inconvenience""....okay so a multi billion dollar company screws up and then I have to drive 84 minutes round trip (with gas prices at 3.10 per gallon) and waste over 2 hrs of my time (drive, stand in line to return, shop for correct motor oil, stand in line and check out). Seems fair. They again apologize and offer me a 5$ gift card...wow thanks ðŸ™„. I explain this isn't acceptable so they tell me there is nothing to do but keep the wrong oil....looked it up while on the phone with them and it's 30$ per bottle. I explain if I keep it it is 90$ and they again tell me I should return it. Lol...nah keeping it and will return it to the store at a later date and get the 90$ in store credit in lieu of returning it for 15$..... Interesting way to do business...lose $$ and to have policy that screw their customers that order in good faith. Expecting your customers to correct your mistakes...nice. Already pay workers crap and screw them...might as well treat consumers the same way."

The site said a two day delivery, which is apparently not true. One of the items I ordered would have taken almost two weeks to arrive. They had no problem advertising two daily delivery time, but it rarely ever happens."
3839,42709,Alice Scott,17/08/2021,Walmart,"Customer service is very poor. Every agent that I spoke with had a foreign accent, making understanding them extremely difficult. I received an email stating that I had received my items. The accompanying photo of the delivery was the steering wheel of an automobile, not my home. I informed the Walmart associate that I donâ€™t live in a car. The associate then claimed that I had received numerous refunds, which was a lie. Also the day of the supposed delivery, another associate called to state that the driver hadnâ€™t placed the items correctly in the computer, and that I wouldnâ€™t be receiving them. Dealing with Walmart customer service is extremely frustrating. I plan to avoid Walmart from here on."

Something is always missing and I end up having to write, email, call, etc. just to get the items I have paid for. It has happened yet again! I ordered a two-pack of hair color. It reads Rollback, (2 pack) for $9.76. I ordered 2 of this item and they charged me for 2 for $19+. I should have received 4 boxes of the item. Again....I only received two. I paid for 4 and only received 2. No one there will help me. I have been emailing all day long and getting nowhere. I started at 11 this morning and the last email was 5:30 tonight. The last email tonight around 5:30 pretty much told me they can change their pricing, etc. and to read the policy. That's just bull. I already paid for something and they wont send it to me. How is this legal that they can charge me for an item, refuse to send it, then tell me it's just too bad? They're keeping my money and not sending me the item I paid for."
3841,42711,Mike Burbank,17/08/2021,Walmart,"I will not use walmart.com again. Their lackadaisical attitude towards your order is mind blowing! I ordered a tent on Saturday needing it by Wednesday. Well the box arrived but my tent was not in it, it was an Igloo cooler going to New York. The Middle Eastern gentleman I was talking to said I can keep it, give it away, or take it to the store. The actual shipping label was in the cooler. He then told me the soonest I could get said tent was on Thursday. I told him that would not work I need by Wednesday. He said the other option is to cancel, get a refund and a cheap twenty-five dollar gift card. I told him that was not good enough. I asked him if the refund had been taken care. He said yes. I then replied I am finished with you have a nice evening. After the phone call I returned the Igloo cooler to my local Walmart where I ended up having to buy their version of the same tent at almost the same price. I even suggested sending it to a local Walmart where I could pick it up later on Wednesday which he replied I can not do that. So some poor woman is not going to get her Igloo cooler but something else, probably my tent."
3842,40206,ROB buzz,17/08/2022,Walmart,We. Bought a table and chairs Phil villa donâ€™t waists your money. The finish was crap already rusting out of the box. The screw holes were were off the screws were off center so the screw would not go in. Thatâ€™s the table 7 chairs it look so cheaply done. I have a party this week end so no time to as for another table. Walmart weâ€™re quality control the must be blind what crap never agian will I buy this crap. This was online
3843,40234,Jessica Long,17/08/2022,Walmart,"So far EVERYTHING Iâ€™ve needed to return lately that Iâ€™ve bought from Walmart on the app, I have NOT been able to return because of â€œtheir new systemsâ€ or they just donâ€™t have an explanations. Codes arenâ€™t working, nothing. I am out so much money!! And I still get emails saying â€œnow returns are easier than everâ€â€¦. What a sham. Iâ€™m starting to wonder if this is Walmarts new thing to stiff people of their money because so many other people are experiencing this too!  He was friendly but thatâ€™s as far as it goes. There was no resolution and I am still stuck with the product and being told â€œcall the 800 numberâ€ and â€œreturn it to the storeâ€â€¦â€¦"

3846,40271,Evelyn Heath,17/08/2022,Walmart,If you have been scammed by Walmart or their third party sellers contact the Federal trade commission FTC they have a lawsuit out against Walmart and other companies and they will take your report seriously Walmart we are sick you stealing from us and we're sick of your third-party scammers give him a call they will help you they will take the report. Just Google it and find out. I turn them into the FTC and I can't wait to happen that's what they get for taking money off my card without my knowledge screw you Walmart and screw your third party sellers you are trash never order anything from Walmart ever again. And if you'd like been scammed by spray tail LLC which is the third party of Walmart then go look up their Google reviews because they are horrible and if they lied and said they didn't take money off your card if they lied and said that they sent you what they didn't send you turn them in FTC we'll take it seriously
3847,47275,Ernie Lee,18/08/2016,Walmart,Purchased a TV from Walmart online store and a TV set has winkled screen. I thought I can simply return this to Walmart but it can not be returned to Walmart since it was sold by one of its subcontracting website. The website asked me to send it back by my cost. Really disappointing experience - very irresponsible sales strategy by Walmart and the website called bargainstation.com. I will NOT purchase any product from Walmart website again.
3848,47166,Allan,18/08/2017,Walmart,"After shopping Amazon for years I gave Walmart a chance. I couldn't change and order, nor cancel an order within hours. There is no two day shipping, your items will arrive sometime withing the next few days or even within the month. I do not see how they can go head-to-head with Amazon."
3849,47167,Danette Fertig Thompson,18/08/2017,Walmart,"This is the second (and last time) I have ordered from Walmart.com, only to have the shipment delayed, cancelled, delayed again and finally, in frustration, cancelled by me. This time the shipment was literally less than 10 miles from it's destination when Walmart informed me the shipment had been cancelled because an item had been damaged in transit. When I contacted them, I was told they would ""rush"" a replacement shipment and it would arrive in two days. Instead, the items weren't re-shipped at all. I finally got notification that the order had been resubmitted but wouldn't arrive for nine days. When I contacted Walmart.com, the ""customer service representative"" asked, ""What do you want me to do about it?"" Really? No other solution or compensation was offered. At first he even told me I couldn't cancel the order because it was ""in transit."" Finally, the order was cancelled but I was told it would take a week to process a refund. Wow. Really great ""customer service"" Walmart."
3850,46586,Brenda Watts-Scott,18/08/2019,Walmart,"the worst on the planet, I order items and they are sent to a store 100 miles away and they tell me it must be a glitch, funny that some items are delivered to the store 2 miles from my house and some are sent elsewhere and it is not the post office this time I see the address they sent it to..... I have called them several times about this and nothing has been done."
3851,46587,Richard,18/08/2019,Walmart,I purchased I phone from Wal-Mart in ride road her Here I Florida brought it home and could not transfer my number to the brew phone. Took it back and was told that the phone was not the phone that came worth the box. I had all thepaper work that proved my purchase. The manager came or and told me that they can not sale a phone that does not match the box. That this is emposable for then to make a mistake. I Took that as get calling me a liar. She said she needs the phone that came with the box. Now I'm a thief as well. I make desint money. I have no reason to steal. So If you purchase a phone here at this Wal-Mart. besure to have therm open it and look at the product you just perchesd or you may to be accused of being a liar and a thief.
3852,42697,Gabe FigueirÃ³,18/08/2021,Walmart,Bought the item for pick up in store.  Drove 1 hour and 20 minutes to pick up the item.  When I arrive there I was told the purchase was canceled.  I never got a notification about the cancelation.
3853,42698,Robert James,18/08/2021,Walmart,"Online shopping is as unpleasant & as in-store shopping. In-store shelves are unstocked & empty. Each time we have ordered online we get ""cancellation"" notices on many of the items ordered. You read lots of ""hype"" about Walmart ""supposedly"" having a great inventory control system, but if you can't keep items in stock &/or on the shelf what good is the ""system"". Overall Walmart offers the WORST shopping experience in the retail industry."
3854,42699,Missie Grim,18/08/2021,Walmart,I ordered a computer from Walmart which came from a 3rd party on 7/28 I was told on 8/5 the computer was delayed when I reached out to Walmart they told me that FedEx never picked up the computer so I asked to have the order canceled I was assured the order was canceled and was told that it would take up to 7 business days for the refund to show on my card statement. Then what happens is this computer that was never picked up and I had canceled the order mind you shows up on my front porch. Someone replaced the order it was either the computer store or Walmart. Walmart is saying they did not replace the order that they cannot do that. another issue with Walmart they are dealing with these 3rd party companies and you might be ordering something from China. I'm not sure if I will ever order from them again.
3855,42700,Jeri Gary Johnson,18/08/2021,Walmart,"I wish I had read these reviews prior to ordering. I will not use Walmart again. I placed a fairly large order, delivered over a 7 day period. EVERY boxed item, potatoes, crackers, etc were smashed & broken to pieces; the majority of the canned goods were dented; the snack packages of peaches were smashed & the liquid saturated the box, which was smashed. It amazes me the way they package. The only orders received in excellent condition were the ones shipped by Amazon (how this happens I do not know, I didn't order from them) My orders were placed with Walmart. I wrote numerous reviews for each received package."
3856,42701,Donna Miliano,18/08/2021,Walmart,"If I could give a 0 review, I would. I ordered a carpet cleaner from Walmart.com. It was supposedly delivered today by a individual that left it at a wrong house in which I cannot find. The picture taken of where it was left just shows a step. Who knows where it is. Called Walmart, they have the name of carrier but no phone number. Who does that? Can anyone just pick up an order and deliver it? Called customer service, no help. Called Walmart store, no help. Someone needs to get their act together. Terrible customer service."
3857,42702,Christel Seymour,18/08/2021,Walmart,I order from Walmart and I wanted to buy a cake and ice cream and they are unavailable! the cakes are always unavailable!They didnt even substitute it!This always happens they never have anything in stock.Jewel osco has better customer service than this!I I am disappointed!One time my sister ordered something from there and they didnt even show up!They didnt even bother to send my sister an email!That was a waste of the 20 dollars in shipping and handling!I didnt even get a refund!
3858,42703,David Solomon,18/08/2021,Walmart,"solomon@viamediaIt is no question why Amazon is kicking Walmart's butt in sales these days. I ordered a high end package for my sons Birthday nearly 3 weeks in advance of his birthday. When I would go to Walmart's tracking package it would show that the item has been shipped. 2 days before his birthday, I had not received the package yet and online through Walmart's portal it continued to show its in shipping process. I call customer service and stay on hold for 45 minutes to find out that the item has been loosed and the only resolution is to refund my money.  The empathy and customer service is non existent and the method of resolution is unacceptable. I am so disappointed in Walmart's management and training. I will use Amazon moving forward and I caution anyone who uses Walmart's online efforts to deliver what they say they will deliver.  David Solomon CEO Viamediatv.com"

3861,42780,PuiLam Wun,18/08/2021,Walmart,"Wish I had read all these reviews before I bought anything from Walmart. I ordered on-line a toy tablet for my grand daughterâ€™s birthday 1 month ahead but just found out her dad already bought her a real tablet. So I took the toy to Walmart to return. The first time I went there, the line was out to the door and I went the second time. After waiting for 20 minutes , I was told by â€œCustomer Serviceâ€ (donâ€™t know why they call it â€œServiceâ€, because absolutely no service was rendered.) that I need a box to return. There were some used boxes behind her but she told me to buy a box from them. So I brought a box back the next day and again stood in line for 15 min. Lucky me, I went to the â€œcustomer serviceâ€ that couldnâ€™t do on-line orders. OK, I waited for another 10 minutes for the other â€œcustomer serviceâ€. After trying a while to pull up my order, she printed out a slip of paper to tell me to contact the 3rd party seller. Why didnâ€™t the â€œcustomer serviceâ€ tell me that yesterday and instead made me come back with a box? My point is I bought it from Walmart and I paid Walmart, why I had to contact the 3rd party? Walmart makes profits from selling 3rd party merchandize, but they donâ€™t want to take the responsibility. I talked to a friend. She told me she had to make 4 trips to return something too. NEVER AGAIN! Update:. I called the seller who was surprised that Walmart told me to contact them. They told me that Walmart had the authority to refund me. I was so upset that I gave the tablet to Salvation Army. This is not worth my time."

3867,40253,Ted Unlis,18/08/2022,Walmart,"Walmart+ has deceptive additional charges! On my 1st order utilizing the Walmart+ â€œHome Deliveryâ€ service that Walmart touts as â€œfreeâ€ with no $35 minimum, I discovered that was a lie. If any items are selected for home delivery Walmart charges a delivery fee if the order total doesnâ€™t meet the $35 minimum. Equally deceptive and rising to sleazy scam level is the 20% â€œDelivery Driver Tipâ€ Walmart automatically tacks on the total. Itâ€™s up to you to go back and figure out how to delete the tip (And then worry about retaliation from a delivery driver Walmart employee whoâ€™s been trained to expect tips). Who in their right mind would pay $98 a year for the privilege of being scammed by Walmart for every additional fee & tip they can possibly milk from customers."

I understand goof up's happen and ordered a different configuration with the option to pickup at same store and the repeated same thing. Please don't purchase anything online and waste your time.

After they serviced my vehicle the tell me, oh you have an oil leak. Really, then why did you change the oil when you know that it's going to leak back out?  That is bad costumer service, because they knew that I was wasting my money. I believe the damage was done by them.  I use to love shopping here, but I am so upset that I can't keep giving them my money.  I will continue to write a post about this because I believed in Walmart."
3872,36186,Dorothy B,19/08/2018,Amazon Go,"Had to check it out... This was by far the most interesting shopping experience I have had in a while. You literally download the Amazon Go app on your phone, scan your phone and enter. You can have up to four people including yourself join you. The store is very well laid out. The prices are not that bad either. You can buy candy, chips, soda, water, yogurt, fresh fruits and veggies, meals for two that are ready to cook, beer and wine (which they have an attendant carding you before you chose your item), Amazon Go swag, and other items. After you chose your items you just walk out! A few minutes later you receive an email with your receipt! There is a small area if you want to sit and eat you can, there is a microwave, and plastic utensils. The other perk is there is a phone charging station! Definitely would recommend going to visit. If there was one of these in my area I would frequent it often!"

In regards of tough to get items, Walmart is not the place to go online. They are selling stock that they don't have. This will likely cause you to miss out on that item from other places that drop actual stock."
3878,42696,Stacy Hunt,19/08/2021,Walmart,"We purchased two beds from Wal-Mart and they were delivered in a decent time frame given the complications of COVID. Well, one of the beds had zero hardware included in it. We contacted the manufacturer who were completely unwilling to help so we processed a replacement through Wal-Mart which seemed super easy. They would send a replacement and we had about a month to return the item via a Fed-Ex tracking slip that they provided. Well, a month later I was charged for another bed because they said they never received the item. When I contacted them I was told via a chat exchange that they found the item and I would be issued a full refund within 24 hours. 24 hours came and went an no refund. I contacted customer service again and was told that they never received the item and I would not be getting a refund. This entire purchase has been a nightmare and I will never be purchasing from Wal-Mart again because of it. This review certainly won't affect Wal-Mart at all but hopefully it will make you think twice before purchasing large items online from them. You are safer purchasing elsewhere."

In honesty, I'm glad my account has been deactivated so I never have to deal with Walmart Customer Service again. Appalling"

3887,44655,Tammy Redden,20/08/2020,Walmart,"I went to Walmart on Conley Road in Columbia MO, to purchase a T.V. for the company that I work for. After a few days we decided that the t.v was no longer needed. 8 days later I went back to Walmart on Conley Road to return the t.v. Upon arriving to return the t,v. I was informed by an Anna that they had no record of the purchase. I did not have the receipt at the time. It had been submitted to our business office. Another guy who appeared to be over Anna tried to go into the back office to try and find the receipt. They both asked me the date of purchase, which I did not know at the time. He looked up a couple of dates in the back supposebly and came back and said we cannot find the receipt based on your credit card numbers. I stood holding the credit card and he said all I need is the last four numbers of the card. They did not use my card otherwise to track the t.v. I was then informed that I would have to go back to my company and get the receipt because they could not verify the purchase otherwise. While standing at the front counter another employee walked up to ask a question who got in my 6 inch space. I moved out of the way so he could stand at the counter and talk with a co-worker. As I was walking out the door I was asked for a receipt by a security person who walked by a heard the conversation about me not having a receipt. When I asked for a manager a lady name, ""Tammy"" came to talk with me who said, she would follow up to see what happened about get back with me.She took down no information. She did say sorry that I felt discriminated against. She was very unconcerned with what I was saying to her as well! I have never been refused service for not having a receipt especially when a credit card was used. I know they think ALL black people steal. However, I work at a shelter and I watch people come in with gear from Walmart who do not work. They have shared how one person steals and another person takes it back. I will never pre-correct them again. My words will be get them from now on. Horrible experience all the way around!! I have never felt discriminated against like I felt on Wednesday."

Seller tells me they sent the package and that it got lost. I say ok, I'll be patient. Then I contact UPS, they never received a packaged. Dude lied to me. Contact walmart.com again to get refund, only I cant get a refund right now, because I just called and talked to the 3rd party and they closed my ticket. No new tickets can be opened for 48 hours. I wait a whole weekend and call 3rd party on Monday. I'm pissed. Leave a nasty message. Call back. Get through to third party. He says they are working on it. I calm down and say I'll call back in 4 days to check on the package. I call back, 4 days later. No package has been sent. In fact, they are now sold out of the item I want and they have another shipment coming in next week. Give me a break. Walmart.com use better third party sellers. Those guys at Cloverfield in New Jersey are a joke! Shame on you for taking my money and leaving it in some place I cant access for a month. I ordered through Walmart, because of issues with Amazon. I'll never order anything for you guys as long as I live."

I called the customer service and they make it sound like it is so easy to return, I will never order anything from them and if you donâ€™t want to be taken for a ride you will do the same."
3893,40186,Ruth K. McCarthy,20/08/2022,Walmart,I came into Walmart at 10:40 and there were employees at the door and they said we could go in the store so we asked them why? And the said because of there manager so we said the store closes at 11 and all we were going to do was get some water and leave! And when we were talking to a lady that worked there she slammed the door on my FACE! I was so upset so I just left and went to WINCO
3894,40187,Robin Chenery,20/08/2022,Walmart,Go early to avoid crowds. Go to checkout wit full cart. Not one single checkout open with staff. Not one single checkout with conveyer belt open to make it easier for a full cart. Had to check out at small self checkout station which is ridiculous. I spent $305.55 on 8-20-22 & it took forever. I have spent my last dollar at Walmart because I am sick of doing this. ID# 7RGNR1HVXLQ
3895,40189,Sandee Mumbley,20/08/2022,Walmart,"The store in round lake beach, il has construction with huge signs in Spanish. I do not speak Spanish. Why would Walmart place English and Spanish signs side by side? I as a us English speaking citizen feel discriminated against. Seems to be happening more and more..us citizens being discriminated against. Shame on wal mart for catering to only one ethnic group!!!!!"
3896,40192,Ronan Costello,20/08/2022,Walmart,If I could give a zero I would by far the worst company I have ever dealt with. I was told I was getting a rewards card but was told when the application was complete that it was a credit card and that the amount was already debited to my account so it coudnt be cancelled.I never received the credit card and because of this I wasn't able to pay my bill. When I eventually got my credit card number my account was locked and I couldn't gain access. AVOID WALLMART AT ALL COSTS.
3897,40219,Shannon Hayden,20/08/2022,Walmart,Bought a phone online because the phone I wanted is not in local store.got the phone & found out one of the idiot Walmart employees didn't even scan the bar code.So I can't use a phone I almost paid 200 dollars for.i'm not happy about this at all
3898,40226,George Pavlik,20/08/2022,Walmart,"I will no longer waste time and money in this store. They consistently understock shelves, 30 check out lines with 2 open. The last 3 times I attempted to shop here I went for a specific item, which was out of stock in generic brand and the name brand was more expensive than both the both other stores closer to me. I also ordered online to avoid many headaches, but I had to add extra items to my cart for free shipping. The 1 item I really wanted, was just cancelled. Plus their parking lots should be filmed for the next dystopian movie made. Target has a much better atmosphere, discounts and giftcard promotions constantly, and most importantly stocked shelves."
3899,40230,Army Mom,20/08/2022,Walmart,"I met a Karen today while trying to do an online pickup! She asked another White Employee to watch me as I Inquired about the Groceries that I'd been waiting on for over an hour, she told me she didn't know what I was going to do to her (BLACK OLDER LADY). Yep, I was upset because nobody even the manager wouldn't just say... We gave your order to somebody else, or we're Re-Shopping your order for you. Karen told me to just cancel the order, but that was impossible because SOMEBODY other than me had picked up the order. Karen then said to call customer service and explain the situation to them! I told her since they messed up, they should call. Sitting back waiting for the Popo! SMH"
3900,40245,Anonymous,20/08/2022,Walmart,"Terrible Experience. We ordered an online delivery the night before we expected it to arrive 10-11 am the next morning. Instead, the driver got â€œlostâ€ and delivered to the wrong house â€” not even in our neighbourhood. We thought, ok, an honest mistake. But then, Walmart said they couldnâ€™t locate the driver, therefore our food was at some random house that they couldnâ€™t track. Hours later, around 2pm, they claimed they would send another driver to bring the food to our house, and this time, they would ring the doorbell and make sure the food was delivered to us. The driver never showed up, and we still havenâ€™t gotten a refund. This was supposed to be our weekly groceries, and now we have close to nothing in our fridge. Never buying again. (Anonymous email used)"
3901,40248,shelley sprague,20/08/2022,Walmart,Just terrible customer service . Pay for express just expect regular time . Comes 4 hours later when it states 2. Then call just to get thrown into a hold process or transferred all around
3902,40266,Crocky Mason,20/08/2022,Walmart,"... it says ""we are an incompetent bunch who do not read all the negative reviews to get educated"". No product information when the page stops blinkering and the name of the product stops playing hide-and-seek. Is it that those good folks do not want you to buy and send you to Amazon, a serious competitor ? I was lucky and ordered twice some groceries or was it ""grosseries"" ? They were thrown against my storm door, in flimsy, gray, plastic store bags. I had to push hard to dislodge the heap of bags. No tender regards for the frozen food, meats and dairy products. All the same for their clever shopper !! Therefore, if you like to play head games, shopping for your groceries and receiving them thrown at you, you are in your kind of store. I am not and my adventures with them have ended. The service isn't worth 10 bucks a shot plus tip for good performance. You can do better else where."
3903,44654,Mark Maimbourg (razor918),21/08/2020,Walmart,"Started off good but now we have been informed they have a stock for in person shoppers and online shopping so if something you really needed is on your list they will no longer substitute they just remove it and you must drive to the store to purchase. Great deal they have going. Oh And forget a refund, they hide behind their terms of service."
3904,44711,ILA BS,21/08/2020,Walmart,"I always order on line and I will go to pick it up outside. Always missing some products like I order 4 cases of water and get only one. Also, one employee was putting the grocery bags in the trunk where he put soft bags first and heavy bags over it. Today, it was delivery at my house by doordash. We received a completely different order for somebody else. According to the driver, Walmart wrote the orders backwards. Also, we did not get over $80 in groceries. Walmart do not even pay attention to the order. We called Walmart and spoke to the manager. We got the rest of the order the next day. This is Big Walmart, Pinellas Park, Florida."
3905,36438,Laurie M.,21/08/2019,Amazon Go,What a great concept.  Easy to get in and out.  Food selection is good.  Glad we got to visit.  Can't wait for this type of store to get closer to home.
3906,42686,Nick,21/08/2021,Walmart,"The absolute worst never order especially large items from walmart.com. If you want reliability go with Amazon, Walmart is terrible with online ordering."
3907,42687,Ebay customer??,21/08/2021,Walmart,"walmart.com order was a total scam. My order says it was delivered. The post office indicates it was delivered to a different address as listed on the tracking data. Obviously a tracking number was attached to my order that was used for a different order. I wonder why this ""business"" has a one star rating? With this kind of associates I will avoid Walmart.com in the future"
3908,42688,John Pettis,21/08/2021,Walmart,Would give zero star if I could! Never shop wallmart again! Online or instore! Its a joke
3909,42689,for your order,21/08/2021,Walmart,"I purchased some Home Test kits online. The Bile acids urine sample was fine, but the Corticoids was a disaster. It said that it was a saliva test and when it arrived to my house, it was a blood sample. I tried to draw out blood from my finger and the blood did not flow into the tube. I am definitely not going to buy anymore home test kits from Walmart. If I ever want to buy Home test kits, I will go somewhere else to buy them."
3910,40188,Crystal Judge,21/08/2022,Walmart,8/20/22 I placed an order online for pickup. I go pickup order only to get home and discover a broken mirror and a missing clothes hamper. So I call the store to report my findings only to be placed on hold for over 30 minutes or so. So I called again and was transferred to pickup were the phone rang for over 3 minutes. So I call again and asked not to be transferred and asked for a manager placed on hold again for over 30 minutes. I will not be purchasing anything else from here.
3911,40233,Alix Cash,21/08/2022,Walmart,Red bottle of black magic wet shine car wash does not hold up to its name nor advertising. It leaves all the spots. Does not clean car at all. Has no foam abilities or properties. Should be removed from shelf
3912,40235,Dwain Stadie,21/08/2022,Walmart,"I would give Walmart no stars, but the system wouldn't let me do it. I have spent weeks trying to get a return but the return dept can't process it because I purchased the item on a visa gift card. After the purchase the visa gift card was thrown away and now all they want to do with my return is credit the visa gift card I no longer have. Evey time I call about 30 mins after being on hold several times a return specialist informs me, they have reviewed everything, and they will send me a Walmart gift card and guess what? The Walmart card never shows up, this company has lied to me 3 times now! Do yourself a favor and DON'T ORDER FROM WALMART ONLINE! if something goes wrong, they will never return your funds. Stay away!"
3913,40276,Michelle Earl,21/08/2022,Walmart,So tired of endless waits at the check out and seeing multiple employees just walking around . Saturdays at Walmart suck!

3915,47273,M Rayner,22/08/2016,Walmart,I shop WALMART.COM all of the time. I like the pick up in store option. They could train their people a little better on in-store pick up and where to find the boxes ordered.

In fact, if you havenâ€™t downloaded the app, you camnâ€™t enter the store. I recommend it!"

So fifty five dollars wasted .Walmart not interested that their vendors are dealing in fake products . That's enough for me with Wal-Mart online .Wish I would have thought to check reviews before ordering ."
3919,42683,D. Knight,22/08/2021,Walmart,"We tried to post this on Walmartâ€™s reviews but weâ€™re prevented. BIG JOE BEANBAG CHAIR WALMART daring to call it a beanbag chair when in fact it is filled with STYROFOAM which flattens within a week. Itâ€™s moronic when you think of how cheap bean fill is. We bought two of these garbage chairs and in every aspect they are the worst sewn, cheapest crap material which is really paper like. And the bottom is made of the same crap material as paper hospital gowns. We have a video on the CRAZY NOISE THESE CHAIRS MAKE with every move you make in them. It is so loud and offensive I am beyond words at the level of scam profiteering going on here. Read all the reviews by women, including ours. These are garbage profiteers who could care less about duping people with crap. Total waste of money!!!!! They wonâ€™t let me post Link to video of the NOISE this chair makes.:("
3920,42684,Daniela Rocca,22/08/2021,Walmart,"I called to ask about a product I wanted to buy and I asked customer service if they had the product, the lady did not want to check for me and continued to hang up on me."
3921,42685,Denise Brown,22/08/2021,Walmart,"Local delivery is getting worse and worse. Either never receive or receive damaged. This time, placed an order, then it was refunded before it was shipped with a ""return pending"" status time frame. How can you return something that never shipped?? I guess I'll need to stick with Amazon and pay more. It's less of a headache."
3922,40178,Claudia Way,22/08/2022,Walmart,"I left a carriage full of merchandise at 9:00 A.M. because there was NO register's open. I refuse to do self checkout as I am not getting paid for that service. Instead of being open until 11:00 at night close at 9:00 and save the money for the morning shift. I want to do my shopping early and I want a register open. The quantity of stock is horrible but I guess that's being blamed on covid like everything else. This is in the Old Saybrook, Ct store"
3923,40182,Wolfgang Black,22/08/2022,Walmart,"They wasted two hours of my time for something last week, I called to complain and was told someone would contact me. They never did. Their 'customer service' is a joke and they teach Critical Race Theory to their employees and it shows. Done with Walmart and you should be too. Racist and radical and hates their customers."
3924,40194,Kathy Farris,22/08/2022,Walmart,"We shop at Walmart main street, Farmington, NM. At the begining of the pandemic they were reasonable. Today I was run over by personal shoppers. The prices are now through the roof. Every time we go in to shop we get a fist up our rear end with they're ourageous pricing. So done!!!!!!"
3925,40207,Paul Heinig,22/08/2022,Walmart,Dirt thing is the price said 6 dollars then got to the register and it rang up 7 dollars. Then there was only one register that takes cash so I had already had to wait for it so I was running to get to work because of waiting for the one register.
3926,36295,Daniel F.,23/08/2018,Amazon Go,"The Amazon Go store needs to get out and take over all the stores. I'm sorry/not sorry retail workers. You might actually like retail if you're 'stuck' working in an Amazon Go store. The 'deli' workers never have to deal with people. They just churn out delicious grab and go solutions for everyone en masse. I'm not saying that everyone is going to want to grow up and be an Amazon Go worker, but I'd have taken that over working in Golden Corral and smelling like fried chicken for three years. The selection here is actually better for lunch and quick meals than Whole Foods. I'm sure that is Amazon's master plan at monitoring what purchases we make, but it gets me some extra exercise having to walk up the hill to get to the Go store. Add to the fact that because of the constant construction, I've walked past the same adjacent plot to the Spheres many times and had to circle back to the store. Even in the worst cases, the longest time I've spent in the Amazon Go store may be just under three minutes, and that was the first time when a group from work went having no idea what we were doing. The frustrating part (ok, less now months later)? People stopping at the entrance/exit saying 'wait? I can just go?' Even after going several times, I've caught myself questioning what I was doing, and then remembering I literally just need to go away. Have your app ready when you get to the store. It will save you a lot of time during the rush period. If at all possible, leave babies out of the store. Bring your child to work day at the Amazon Go store was a total disaster, but as disasters go, the ease of getting in and out of there in 45 seconds with my breakfast at 7 AM, dodging a few dozen children under 7 was quite impressive. I'm not sure how I made it out alive, but I'm sure Amazon had something to do with it. Wifi is free and good performance in the area so you have no excuse for you app download or it working. They really put this thing through the paces before unleashing it on the public. Did you try to drive here? Get out of town. There is a bike path going in front of the store, so watch yourself heading out the store in case bikers are in the area."
3927,36364,Estela D.,23/08/2018,Amazon Go,"It's an experience that's for sure! You have to download the Amazon Go app on your phone before you can enter (if you don't already have it), just FYI. Once you scan and you're in, it's simple. You grab a free bag, you pick what you want and when you walk out, and you get charged. A receipt is sent to you maybe 10 minutes after you leave and there you have it. You shopped at Amazon Go.  Prices are pretty good for most things here! I got a bottle of Stella Rosa and it was about $13 (average if not cheaper other places) but they were selling water bottles for 49 cents! Super cheap. It's located right next to Amazon HQ so if you want to pop in there afterward you can. There's plenty of stuff to do around there, since it's close to downtown. I'll definitely be going back to buy little things when I come back to Seattle."
3928,42679,Rachel Schuette,23/08/2021,Walmart,I really like going here. It's a lot of fun and I always have a good time. I like the stuff.

Think this is robbery, I am old & on a very fixed income. I understand there is a distribution issue with coin, but there is no actual shortage now. Donâ€™t think I need to shop there anymore. Customer service is very poor and getting worse."
3930,42681,Chimene Walker Taylor,23/08/2021,Walmart,"I went into the walmart located in the Townridge shopping center in Raleigh. They are the absolute worst walmart I have ever been to. I only shop here when I am in a hurry because of their incredibly poor customer service. The clearance racks a supposed to hold clearance items, right? No their lazy employees put full priced items there( not one or two but stacks of them ) when I go to buy them they ring up full price, even when I take pictures show this to the store manager, I get the old "" well a customer may have done it "" no offer to discount the items, offer a plausible reason or anything. And this information about the incorrect placement being done due to lack of space for the items came from THEIR own employees. I have called corporate and was assured the manager would get back to me and...nothing. Since Walmart is only interested in taking my money and not interested in providing at least halfway decent customer service I will not spend my money with them."

Their tracking sucks their service sucks the Indians on the phone are literally trying to steal my money and itâ€™s so obvious. Order a tv suppose to come in on a set date comes day later broken in pieces we call back and she says they will replace it with a new tv in 2 days. 7 days later the tv is still not here and the same indians are still trying to make up lies and scam. Absolutely awful. AMAZON ONLY LADYS AND GENTS.
3933,46582,Megan M,24/08/2019,Walmart,Walmart is a joke I ordered a package on the 15th I was supposed to have it delivered on the 22nd and they did a change of address without my permission so they will just put any random address on your package and it doesn't matter to them so then you figure out where your package is and you have to do the hunt down to figure out I don't think I'm going to order from walmart.com ever again I'll keep with my Amazon I've never had issues with them
3934,46583,Tiffany Wheeler,24/08/2019,Walmart,"I had order five things from them . They all got shipped with different carriers. One item was supposed to arrive on the 23 but tracking hasnâ€™t been updated . The other package was supposed to arrive today so far tracking hasnâ€™t been updated since the 22.

3937,44644,Evelyn Blacha,24/08/2020,Walmart,Horrible. The cashier charged me double the amount and I only had one thing. SO NOT FAIR. Also very rude service and threw our things in the bag.

Some employees witnessed but no word were said to them. Be careful with this Walmart at the Waterworks, although there is always someone outside making sure you go in with a mask, people take it out inside the store."
3939,44646,Nancy Denmark,24/08/2020,Walmart,"Walmart stinks! I used to shop there all the time. I had the app & everything. But they never have enough stock. I went to Walmart Normandy blvd.Jax. Couldnâ€™t find what I needed. I checked Walmart Wilson blvd Jax, it said in stock drove out there. Stuff wasnâ€™t in stock. I had stopped shopping there for 2 months. Iâ€™m done for good now. Back to Winn Dixie!"
3940,44647,Ryan Blum,24/08/2020,Walmart,I was the subject of ageism by walmart inc. I am utterly upset about the way this company handles business. I believe I was targeted because of my age because they felt that they could just push me off. My order was delayed for weeks before cancellation. Walmart had no idea where it was and promised me various different delivery dates. I am so upset I will never buy anything from this company. The customer service department is a mixed bag carlos and liz were very unhelpful and unprofessional but santiago and jose were pleasant. The inconsistency issues leads me to only buy from reliable suppliers like Amazon.
3941,44648,Mellizo Cureaux,24/08/2020,Walmart,"Do NOT use grocery delivery!!! They only get it right 1 out of 10 times. The managers are rude, give lame excuses.

3943,44650,Andrea,24/08/2020,Walmart,"I purchased a computer bundle online and I was horrified by what I saw.I received 2cords, a filthy old time monitor, a mouse and it was in a filthy box.No cpu and no hp brand.The one they send was a Lenora brand.Upon contacting Walmart, I was told that I have to ship the item back and that I would not receive my money until this is done.When I enquire if I could take it to a Walmart store, they said no.I have to ship it.I am very disappointed because this computer was for my son to do his school work online.I have no idea when I will be able to get my money back.Shame on You Walmart.I am a loyal customer of Samâ€™s club and even I wasnâ€™t, this is totally unacceptable.The excuse that I received was,the product was shipped by a marketing company."
3944,44651,jonny,24/08/2020,Walmart,"Garbage service! Ordered 4 pairs of dumbbells. Waited 3 months to receive them. I received an email that they had been delivered finally, hallelujah! 1 package arrived with 1 pair of dumbbells. I called Walmart to inquire about the rest of them as the email showed all have been delivered. Walmartâ€™s answer was, â€œsorry they mustâ€™ve gotten lost.â€ So I said, â€œok, now what?â€ They said, â€œWell, we can refund you, but we cant replace them because we no longer have them.â€ After 3 months of waiting, this is the only thing Walmart can say. Itâ€™s sad that Amazon has taken over so much of the retail industry and ruined so many other businesses, but I guess I now understand why. Sorry Walmart, but that is a big FAIL. What a disappointment!"
3945,44652,Ashlee Lake,24/08/2020,Walmart,They use fedex and fedex has yet to get my packages here on time. I HAD TO CALL THEM at 7pm on the expected delivery date and they told me my packages wouldnâ€™t be here for another two days. They have been sitting In the Orlando facility for two days... The guy tries to use Covid as an excuse but thatâ€™s pathetic because I have ordered packages from Amazon and USPS managed to get my school supplies here in time and also UPS when I ordered from best by. Find a better shipping company. Not being notified is ridiculous and the rude comments just make it even worse.
3946,44653,Randy Fox,24/08/2020,Walmart,"So I went to the Marion Ohio Walmart. It's my regular store. Staff at the front door,not enforcing the wear a mask. Just letting people walk in. Not even challenging them. The signs and the PA , system is telling all staff and customers, MUST wear a mask. People in the store,no masks, one guy had his dangling off one ear, another wearing his on top his head. Others no mask at all. No one stopped them no one challenge them. I spoke to two male staff, they said they were told to not say nothing. They said there are security guard and manager for that. I observed the female security guard walk by numerous people with no mask and or wearing inappropriate. The manager was requested but never showed up. Plain and simple, it's a rule, I believe a needed one. Tell people to obey or leave, simple enough. Do your damn job's."
3947,36184,SeattleShrew,24/08/2018,Amazon Go,"Had to check it out... The beauty of Amazon Go is it's a convenience store with the best checkout experience ever -- none. We go there to buy small salads, yogurt, bread, soda, VitaminWater Zero, etc. But don't overthink this place, it's small and for convenience, it's not a luxe food store. The sandwiches are cold and not particularly tasty, although they are made on the premises (you can see the kitchen from the street windows). This store also gets crazy busy with tourists who aren't buying anything but looking around in wonder. I sneak in, grab what I need and get out of Dodge as soon as possible. A few minutes later I get a detailed descriptions with photos of what I bought and in what quantity. There hasn't been a mistake yet in what I've been charged. Great experiment by Amazon, which will no doubt apply this innovation into other areas. BTW, the Amazon employees who help the uninitiated with the Go app and procedures are very friendly at the scan gates and in the store. One employee was able to check on stock with his handheld computer when I asked if any stock was in the back of a particular item. I like this place."
3948,36368,Matthew D.,24/08/2018,Amazon Go,"Small selection but the novelty is very much worth it. You sign up for the app, walk in, and walk out. There are sensors in the store so you don't have to go to a cash register. The cool thing is you get a recipient afterwards with all the items you picked up like magic.  This has only recently went public about 6 months to a year ago (unsure of the exact time)--so its still a very new and interesting idea. I'm curious if these will start showing up in competition with 7 Eleven stores."

3951,42677,Theresa West,24/08/2021,Walmart,"I'm going to give Walmart a three because normally they have been very good to me at least in the small town that I live in but I bought a phone from them that said total wireless, total wireless had no bad reviews so I spent $200 on the phone and 35 on the card. I am on disability and I have a small child I have very little income and we straight by me cleaning houses so my phone number is very important after trying to get my phone connected and my phone number switched over it took me all day I spoke with many people who could not speak English and the phone doesn't work so half the time when I call out or I'm in the middle of a conversation it turns off so I called Walmart corporate office because I found out total is in fact TracFone but you do not see that on their prepaid card anywhere on the case that you're not allowed to open when you buy it but it is in very small letters and the pamphlet and then it shows up after they connect your phone. Point being is TracFone has thousands of bad reviews Walmart New they switch their name to Total which should be totally illegal they did not inform their customers that it was a TracFone so when I inform Walmart they said they would work they would take the phone but my $35 plan is not the responsibility well I believe it is because they falsely identified a bad company customer service was extremely rude to me and did not seem to care at all about everything that I have been through this is not only an immoral thing to do but it's illegal but I guess they're Walmart so I guess they think they can do whatever they want I'm sick of big corporations getting away with everything"
3952,42678,PureNonchalant,24/08/2021,Walmart,"I wish I had read Walmart delivery reviews before ordering anything online from Walmart. $50 dollars worth of school supplies delivered to random houses, Only ONE driver out of 5 came to my correct address. I had to issue an refund for 90% of my order. Never again!"
3953,40173,Elzahra Kasim,24/08/2022,Walmart,"Iâ€™m a high school student and all I wanted to do was buy a note-binder, because theyâ€™re more convenient than a separate notebook and binder. For a place thatâ€™s trying to bring me â€œlow prices, everydayâ€, why was one of those note-binders $15.96??? Iâ€™m in high school, I donâ€™t make much money and anyways why is a note-binder $15!? Make education affordable and accessible, because this is ridiculous."
3954,40183,L Howard,24/08/2022,Walmart,"I went to Walmart at Colonial and 6 mile Cypress today in Ft Myers. Florida. The store was filthy, it's hard to find help with someone that speaks English, the whole frozen vegetable section was out, shelves were not stocked, but I did manage to buy 130.00 worth of groceries and not 1 human to check me out. It was all self check out. And the conveyor belt didn't even work. And the scanner was so dirty I had to scan some items 3 times. The employees were all playing with their phones with bad attitude which triggered mine too. I will NEVER shop there again."
3955,40185,DARK MATTERS,24/08/2022,Walmart,I HAD TO PUT ONE STAR TO WRITE THISðŸ¤¬ WALMART BETTER STAY IN RACIST AMERICA ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ I HAVE JUST SEEN HOW YOU TREAT BLACK PEOPLE IN YOUR STORE IN OREGON YOU RACIST PIGS DISGUSTING BEHAVIOUR BY YOUR STAFFðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ IF YOU OPEN A STORE IN THE UK I PERSONALLY WILL REDUCE IT TO ASHESðŸ’¯
3956,40260,Doroteja P.,24/08/2022,Walmart,"Good experience as a long time customer, specially good delivery service.  Not sure why all the bad reviews, they provide a good affordable service."
3957,40273,Robert Micheli,24/08/2022,Walmart,I no longer shop at a place that has one checker with a line clear to the back wall of the store which elderly people have to stand in because they donâ€™t understand modern junk . Even for me why should I have to do a job that is theirs and on top of that pay 10 cents for every bag shouldnâ€™t they pay you for doing a job there supposed to do ? There was an elderly lady stuck in a scooter of theirs in the 100 plus degree weather when I told the greeter he said what do you want me to do about it ! Gee I donâ€™t know we ended up pushing her to her car because the store had zero working scooters ! They try to push mom and pop stores out by buying all the stalk in companyâ€™s and making them make them a cheap product with a good name ! They made millions if not billions selling guns and ammo and if there so big on anti guns shouldnâ€™t they give that money back to the people who registered to buy guns from them ? Legally I might add it wasnâ€™t anyone who had legally obtained a weapon that attacked them they are in whole an anti American liberal dishonest immoral greedy company !
3958,47329,Ray Wil TT,25/08/2014,Walmart,I ordered a product online for in store pick-up and it was delivered to the location on time for my pick up. This was the first time I had tried this so I was a bit uncertain that it would be there when promised. Well done
3959,47165,Doris Kendrick Culverhouse,25/08/2017,Walmart,Walmart's return policy is there saving grace. If they didn't have that they would be a no go for me. most of their items are good but some are defective. so it is a hit and miss. but since they take them back you don't have to worry.
3960,46578,Nicole Zolondek Michel,25/08/2019,Walmart,"Ordered for the new NextDay Delivery that Walmart advertises on Friday, so I should of received my order on Saturday. No delivery on Saturday and now the order status saying Delayed! Chatted with Walmart who said my order was lost in delivery and they could now reorder. But i will not be getting my order until Tuesday now, so much for NextDay Delivery through Walmart. I would not do this again. Also was offered $10 promo for the difficulty which I thought was great until I opened the email and their was a stipulation for $10 off my next purchase of 15 or more. I thought I was suppose to get something nice for the difficulty Walmart put me through and now I have to spend even more!!!!"
3961,46579,Elizabeth Roberts,25/08/2019,Walmart,"You have a woman who checks receipts at the Lebanon, Oregon store, named Linda. She is aggressive and rude, goes through peoples things and accuses them of stealing when they haven't. She has had multiple complaints including one that I made but she is still there!! Many of your customers are not returning because of this horrible associate.. I went in today and she is still there. Should be fired or transferred to another job. She has gray hair and I confirmed her name is Linda. You are losing a lot of business because of this woman.  I complained to Walmart via their website and they don't care! This is a horrible place and I am not going to shop there anymore."
3962,44638,Dante _Cocker Spaniel,25/08/2020,Walmart,I would give 0 star if I could. Their customer service department is full of unprecedently rude reps including the supervisor Ronda who intentionally hung up on me to avoid unwanted conversation and Hillary from the resolution team. Someone needs to do something to do quality control of the internal staffs. Horrible.
3963,44639,Valerie Leeman,25/08/2020,Walmart,I ordered something from walmart online over a week ago. Still not here and says it's still in china?? I thought I was buying from the United states!!! No more Walmart for me!!!
3964,44640,Mike,25/08/2020,Walmart,Seven months ago I bought a small refrigerator. A week and a half after it was supposed to be delayed I called. They told me that they canceled the order and reordered with a 30% discount. When that one was delivered it was all dented and I returned it. They credited me for the discount price and I bought one somewhere else. 2 months ago the charge was on my card again. I called and was told that they hadn't charged me. I contacted the credit card company and they held the money until investigated. Then released it back to my account. Now they billed me for it again and when I called told me the first one ordered was delivered and I would have to pay or contract the credit card company to dispute it. The credit card company has told me that Walmart has to remove the charge. So now I have to give $243.47 to Walmart in order to keep a bad mark against my credit off of my record. DO NOT TRUST WALMART.
3965,44641,Brian,25/08/2020,Walmart,"What can I say about the late great WalMart? Well, I guess first off I would like to give a shout out to Sam, the founder.. Sam, although we all know by now ...that you have probably spent the most part of your passing, rolling in your grave... I just want you to know we DO NOT Blame you in any way shape or form for the abuses it's overseas manufacturing plant workers in China, who are forced to live on $3.00/day and forced to work 7 days a week under human rights violations. Nor, Sam can we disparage you for the fact of the low wages, understaffed, forced to go on welfare employees in the U.S. Nor would anyone accuse you of environmental violations here in the U.S. and far more likely as well around the world. And of course could we Blame you for all the female discrimination that is more than very likely still going on, especially probably still here in the states, and..., And, well... The list so far is only the tip of Mount Everest, so I'm sorry Sam, but there's a recent visit to one of the WalMart stores built years later after our mourning of your passing. And it went a little bit like this... Before I could step on the front outside walkway, I instantly became a wanted suspected criminal as suddenly I was facing a barrage of embarrassing barking orders that I could not enter that particular store w/o a mask even as I had my mask in my hand covering my face as I attempted to secure the mask stringage around both ears. So, Still not sure why I was betrayed for some kind of crime I guess this particular store employee thought she saw before her to bark, I MEAN BARK AT ME AS IF ""I WAS A DOG!?"" SO... Anyway , I walk into the store and I see another employee ring highly rude to an elderly lady at the self checkouts and I try to ignore this, for fear at being now either barked at or treated in a similar rude manner as the poor old lady was regretfully being talked down to . Anyway ..I realize right away I really have already seen enough to shorten my shopping list. Considerably from 17 items to just one item. So I go to get that one item and... Drumroll, that item is not on the shelf, so I needed to reassure myself that I did not waste time by driving a few miles to get at the store in the first place by choosing the next just as important item off the shelf... Only to find no shelf. The shelf was missing along with the item., Soooooo, I decided on the next important item to find it was the very last item ...and still sitting on the shelf even though clearly it was broken with broken pieces of glass surrounding it. 3X would not be the charm over the fruitless effort I initiated to shop, buy, and bring home with me. So, upon hearing and then witnessing a sudden scuffle between an employee and a customer, with the employee trying his damnest to bring this customer down WWE, THATS when I high-tailed it outta that department nearly running for the exit doors!!! WalMart is as I quickly summized, some twisted parody paradox of it's former self....(what WalMart once was when Sam was alive). From A company that really had a solid grasp of reality when it came to treating not only their employees with respect and dignity, Sam's Way... To some kind of loathing experience shared by customers and employees alike!!!! I mean, come on WalMart!!! What ever happened to you after Sam's passing, huh? Why the ongoing abuse and immoral judgements and unfounded actions you now cling tightly to!?!?!? Where and why did all this have to come about, other than the clear fact it's being run into the ground by some would relate to greedy psychotic behaviors that show case what happens when a once great company comes under seige by bottom lines not to it's employees or customers benefit, but clearly instead to the rich shareholders and the ilk that for now dominate over the corporate offices. Seriously WalMart, what will the future bring you, what will history end up saying about you? Do you want to be on the right side of history? Stay on the same last two decades track of lies and deceit? Seriously?"
3966,44642,Stacey S,25/08/2020,Walmart,"This is the first time that I have used Walmart's Next Day Delivery and I am not impressed. My items should have arrived yesterday and according to the FedEx tracking link, they are still in the original location. It looks like I didn't save myself a trip the store AND will end up with twice as much as I wanted."
3967,36356,Sitara M.,25/08/2018,Amazon Go,"How cool is this place!! You have to see it to believe it. The whole process from start to end is so seamless that it's amazing how it all works. Download the Amazon go app on your phone, walk in to the store, open the app, scan the barcode at the entrance and that's it! If there are multiple folks entering the store but using a single app or a count, then make sure you scan the barcode multiple times to get each one access to enter the store. Pick up an orange Amazon go cloth bag (at no extra charge), pick up what you want and leave the store. No scanning needed! No lines! No wait! This is so awesome when you are in a hurry and have no time to wait In line during peak busy hours. The selection is pretty good too. From beverages to snacks, chocolates and candy, ready to cook meal boxes, ready to eat meals, wraps, sandwiches, desserts, and a bunch of basic supplies like eggs, meat and milk."
3968,42672,Patrick - off to Argentina,25/08/2021,Walmart,"I have to confess Iâ€™m not a Walmart in store shopper most definitely since covid. That said, Iâ€™ve ordered 3 times in the last month from Walmart.com and am impressed with the detailed emails they send advising how the order will be shipped, from multiple suppliers, and shipped date. All were right on time. Of note: if you expect all items ordered will be in the same shipment ðŸšš you may find they ship from the manufacturer, not from a Walmart central warehouse. Thatâ€™s why they can offer free shipping on a $20 orderâ€¦"
3969,42673,CBanks,25/08/2021,Walmart,"We ordered an adult tricycle through Walmart.com. The vendor, Joi Market, sent us a cheap $200 Pexmore bike not the $500+ Schwinn bike we ordered. We contacted Walmart immediately and they sent a message to the seller for us to receive return labels for the boxes and a refund. After getting the runaround from the seller for a couple of weeks, Walmart said they would refund our money. A MONTH later, after receiving refund promises from 4 different Walmart representatives, 3 supervisors and a billing representative (thank you Krista), we finally got our money back and a $25 gift card. Very frustrating and horrible customer service!! In the midst of all of this, we ordered the Schwinn bike from Amazon and received the correct bike within two days!"
3970,42674,customer,25/08/2021,Walmart,"I went to the 12mile and Van Dyke store to do a return, the line was all the way back to the next entrance/exit doors with only one lady, Ayanna, working the customer service dept. I stood in line approx 40mins. Ayanna took care of maybe 20 people in that time. She never had attitude or tone with any of us, she had the calm to speak and be kind to all of us, gave directions to one customer, spoke to a toddler in the cart, while never missing a beat to get the customers taken care of and keep the line moving, Ayanna was Awesome. I want Wal-Mart to recognize Ayanna as an asset to their company. I realize with the way Sooooo many people would rather stay at home and collect unemployment the stores are struggling to carry on daily duties and cover the depts but here you have a woman who is there truly doing her Best. Wal-Mart needs to recognize and reward Ayanna and anyone else who gets a good review especially in these trying times. Shame on you Walmart if you don't!!!! The reason for only 4 stars is on Wal-Mart not Ayanna, I feel management must have seen the line backup and should have given help, even if just to keep the line down when it built up. No worker should be that out numbered!!! Teamwork Walmart, you wanna preach it.....practice it!!!!"
3971,42675,George Kalajyan,25/08/2021,Walmart,"Horrible my order arrived late , the people were no help at all , I requested a handy man service to come set up my desk I had to pay the extra money only to discover I had to book the appointment , the email told me they would email me to set up the appointment but they never did !!!!"
3972,40174,Marlene Lenz,25/08/2022,Walmart,"I signed up for Walmart + one month ago. Iâ€™ve had nothing but trouble with grocery deliveries. The last order was never even delivered. Prior to that I received out of date yogurt, moldy onions, etc. They are supposed to text you when your items are delivered, but that never happens. Ice cream sat on the porch for 2 hrs in 98 degree heat. I asked for a refund on my $98.00 yearly fee and was told no. I even offered to pay for the month I had it, still no go. Now Iâ€™m stuck until 7/23 with a crap service!"
3973,40176,Amy Frey,25/08/2022,Walmart,Shouldn't even get 1 reviews i should have had my order today cuz thats wat my tracking order said and its not even here!! First time ordering online now i know why i dont use online never ever again!! God i definitely cant wait for zellars to come back!! This is wat happens when they dont have any competition!!

3975,40184,Laura Goldschmitt,25/08/2022,Walmart,"I have been shopping at the store in Mayodan, NC, for almost 15 years. I have to say that the crew they have are top notch, from the pharmacy to customer service. Nikki and Amanda are especially sweet. Very kind and professional. I hope they never leave! Kudos!"
3976,40190,Dee,25/08/2022,Walmart,"Walmart! Just an organization that prey's on customers mistake and apologize for a stupid policy. How can l cancel an order 3mins that it was made and l won't get my refund immediately. it's been 4 days now Walmart is holding unto my $220, l imagine them holding 500 customers refund for this long. They will definitely be making alot of money. Walmart is just a rip off. You guys need to learn how it's done from Amazon. Amazon will never do this. Walmart you need to do better in your service delivery. This is really unfair and uncalled for. Please refund my money and stop acting on the pretence of a system error."
3977,40199,Pix,25/08/2022,Walmart,"Everytime, I attempt to shop on my app, it's not working properly, I go elsewhere, pay more, but it's way too big a hassle, why can't Walmart get this thing right? Won't try again, think 15 attempts is enough Good luck using it!"
3978,40250,Wayne Massella,25/08/2022,Walmart,I purchased tires on sale to be delivered to my local store. I waited a week and had an install set up. I received a phone call an hour before install that they sent the wrong tires and I needed to call Walmart.com. I called and was informed the only corse of action os to get a refund and reorder the tires which are no longer on sale. I asked for a refund on Friday was told 24-48 for a email and refund. Monday still nothing called back the girl never submitted the refund. So he said he would Wednesday comes still no confirmation email and no refund called back and the file said she would process the refund I told her to forget it after 6 days and three people I will call my back and file a claim. Itâ€™s going on a week had to spend more than 500 more for tires and still donâ€™t have my refund. I will never purchase from Walmart.com and I would strongly recommend you do the same.
3979,40262,Claudia,25/08/2022,Walmart,"Since Wal-mart can't protect their customers, and are not willing to allow customers to protect themselves, I am taking my business elsewhere."
3980,40268,Mary Wilson,25/08/2022,Walmart,Beware of ordering online and going and picking the products up! !!!!! I was going to my food and checking the dates on the products and on the boxes of chicken broth and beef broth someone had taken an ink pen and punctured it and opened yet and Iâ€™m sure it was whoever was going around the store getting my groceries. I cannot believe these workers are doing this. They couldâ€™ve even spit in it as far as I know. Customers beware when you purchase items and go pick them up at the store and make sure that they have not been opened ! When I called customer service to report it she wanted my order number. She said she could not do a refund without the order number. I had to throw seven boxes of chicken and beef broth in the garbage. I family found the order numbers after 15 minutes and was able to get some of my money back. This is ridiculous that customers from Walmart have to go through this. Just please check your bags your boxes and even your cans. Your milk products anything that has easy access. Thanks
3981,40269,Laura J. Costa,25/08/2022,Walmart,OK. Prices aren't as competitive as other websites. Range is okay. I would shop from them but not without shopping around first.
3982,47328,Kay.C,26/08/2014,Walmart,"I love the low price and the variety of products here. But sometime the queue is very long. My last time shop there, it took me almost 30 mins to make the purchase because people in front of me keep swapping their stuffs in and out to make the best out of their coupon."
3983,46575,soco carranza,26/08/2019,Walmart,walmart had a such great customer service .. always with a smile and willing to help any time someone needed help 4
3984,46576,William,26/08/2019,Walmart,"I recently moved and got a new house, and doing so I ordered a lot of furniture/appliances and what not from Walmart and amazon. Not a single Walmart order made it on time. About a dozen orders over 6 weeks. Even on the day it was suppose to be delivered it would still say preparing order. Then show up randomly a week or two later. Even tho it said two day shipping when ordered. Thankfully amazon came through and wasnâ€™t late on a single order. Iâ€™ll never order from Walmart again as long as amazon has it in stock even if Walmart is cheaper Iâ€™d rather know where and when my things are gonna be here"
3985,46577,Jamie,26/08/2019,Walmart,"Walmart.com used to be awesome and I was ordering at least twice a week from them since I live in the stix and online shopping is a necessity. The past few orders have arrived leaking or otherwise damaged. While the damaged items were replaced, it is a hassle to have to wait for additional shipping time. Another huge problem is their ""next day"" delivery. Ordered Friday and order scheduled for Tuesday...then Wednesday. The customer service dept offered 5% off...ummm yeah...2$ off a 40$ order that is 5 days late. Canceled and will be going back to Amazon, eBay, and Target...They might not have next day shipping but I have found they deliver when they say they will and that is important. Sucks because Walmart used to be reliable...Oh well."
3986,44634,Kelly Love,26/08/2020,Walmart,"I just talked to the rudest customer service person I have ever spoken with. I ordered grocery delivery which was missing a few items, but my account page didn't update to it even being delivered, so I was not given a refund for the items not sent. This person kept turning the conversation on me, like I did something wrong. Every time I tried to get clarification, she would interrupt me and would not let me speak, talking down to me like I was a child or something. She would not confirm if she knows the tech people are working on it or even if they know there is an issue. What an A&&hole!!!!!!!"
3987,44635,Van Wein,26/08/2020,Walmart,Waited all day at sat. because it was supposed to arrive and said it had to be signed for. Did not arrive till 11am wed. And still does not show as delivered in email. No knock to let me know it was outside. Not first time i have had difficulty but will be last.
3988,44636,malik malick,26/08/2020,Walmart,i have recently worked on wall mart its product quality is excellent
3989,44637,Mike Connelly,26/08/2020,Walmart,"The website is a complete joke. They claimed to have 15 and 25 lb dumbbells in stock. When i got there the shelves were empty. The sporting goods register attendant told me they've been out of stock for months.  He also said the website is completely inaccurate on the stock of most items. I ended up driving 30 minutes out of my way to find out that the website is a lie. Aside from that, this store is dirty, items strewn all over with rude employees.  Drive to Springfield to go to a better Walmart!!"
3990,36332,Vincent V.,26/08/2019,Amazon Go,I love the speed at which you can get in and out of this store. With the flip of a barcode you can whiz inside and grab what you need and exit. No having to wait in lines with incompetent check-out stand clerks. No having to zig zag between aisles of people lost at what they came for helplessly grasping at a piece of paper they scribbled upon with a list of goods they can hardly find in an overly complicated grocery store. Just you. Your speed. No hassle. I hope one day this grows into a larger store with more selection. I'd never shop anywhere else but here if that day came.
3991,36205,Deana M.,26/08/2021,Amazon Go,"Easy to sign up and easier to shop. You can sign up in-store and it takes less than 5 minutes. However, it is better if you come in earlier if you want certain food items. Otherwise, it'll be out of stock if you shop later in the day. Our hotel was walking distance so it was a great place to get water, snacks, etc. during out trip."
3992,36207,Kirti V.,26/08/2021,Amazon Go,Limited choices and not clear what the process is  Also not apparent how you handle food that needs heating  Kind of a crappy customer experience
3993,42669,Nicole Marfino,26/08/2021,Walmart,"Had half an order delivered. Offered a refund on the missing items no refund on any part of the shipping or tax in this order. Originally bought the product on sale. This is not the first time theyâ€™ve done this they are stealing your money through not returning on shipping cost, tax, and then having to re-purchase at full price"
3994,42670,Lb,26/08/2021,Walmart,if i could give them less then on star i would. I have had multiple dealings of shipping with them. They are the worse shipping out of all the companies. They shouldnt be they area big company. I mean the worse takes weeks to get their stuff and then at that they change the delivery date again to a longer time. Dont order online with them they are the worse. I will not do any business with them online anymore
3995,42671,Nathan Bakken,26/08/2021,Walmart,"Incompetent company that has again wasted my time. Amazon is the online king because folks like Walmart cant get it together. Delayed shipping updates, cancelled order... the full unsatisfied customer experience here. And NOTHING even close to an apology, mention of improvement, or even sorry for creating a worthless online marketplace. I'll learn my lesson after strike 5-6 and go to walmart in person only when I'm looking for people_of_walmart.com kind of experience."
3996,40170,Txnt,26/08/2022,Walmart,"Terrible customer service. I bought 10 items and only 8 got delivered. So I contacted them and they refunded me for the 2 that never delivered. Later I return 8 of the boxes by fedex drop off, because the packages were big so I didnâ€™t want to return in store. When I looked at my bank statement they only refunded me for 7 items instead of the whole 8â€¦ so basically they stole $38 from me. I would recommend returning in store for a safer bet of getting your full refund."
3997,40171,Sam,26/08/2022,Walmart,"Don't trust walmart, especially when merchandise price is not listed. Yesterday I stopped at walmart to pick up some dog food, but since I was there I picked up a dozen eggs, but it had no price listed. But since I buy same eggs from our local HEB for $3.49, I figured the price would be about that. But when I got home and checked the receipt it was $4.29, that's 23% higher price at Walmart than a small store in our town. Doing business with Walmart is wrong for you and your family. Not again."
3998,40238,Marie,26/08/2022,Walmart,A couple of weeks ago I ordered from Walmart catalog for three dresses. I had spent quite a bit of money. After a couple of weeks I had not received the items. I called customer service. I was told so many lies One was that they were delivered so wait patiently. The other was that they would refund me my money but I haven't gotten any money yet. Another was my items were delivered and when I go to the website it's still saying that it was delayed but they're saying it's here I'm still waiting for my items. I have not received them or money and I'm very upset. I really am not using the catalog ever to order anything from Walmart anymore because I feel as though it's a big scam and I am the one who have gotten scammed! I've spoke with several customer service reps at Walmart and I've gotten a different story each and every time. Very disappointed.
3999,40240,X O,26/08/2022,Walmart,"If I could give this PIECE OF S*** company ZERO stars I would! The customer service is H O R R I F F I C ! They will lie, leave you on hold hoping you hang up when you call about an issue, they cancel your store delivery order and try to deliver it TWENTY FOUR HOURS LATER?!? Like what?! They drop the ball â€˜accidentallyâ€™ on refunds that are OWED, theyâ€™re a mess. This is what happens when GREED and QUANTITY supersedes QUALITY. Walmart wants all of the money but doesnâ€™t want to put that money into effectively training competent workers and improving the CUSTOMERS experience! Ridiculous! ðŸ¤® Just go to Target!"

4003,46572,Tammie Winkler,27/08/2019,Walmart,I could not be more disappointed in Walmart (again and again). UNBELIEVABLE THAT I CAN PURCHASE A PROTECTION PLAN WITHOUT BEING TOLD THAT IT REQUIRES THE WALMART APP. Walmart provides many items but NOT EVER ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE. I've spent 1/2 day emailing with you and the end result is DO IT YOURSELF SOMEHOW. I may return the TV and Protection Plan and go buy it at Target where they remember what Customer Service means.
4004,46573,James Hoffman,27/08/2019,Walmart,"I purchased an item from Walmart.com using a third party seller ZooScape. Walmart did not assist with the bad transaction. RIPOFF! Be aware that all the items are sold by WEIGHT from ZooScape. I ordered the salted caramel sugar and it was only 15% filled in a normal sized spice bottle. I sent them an email expressing my displeasure and requested a refund, they did agree if I shipped the item back at my expense. I spent $15 including shipping on the order and have to pay for the shipping back for an $8 credit. BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING from Walmart and ZooScape. Read the details!"
4005,46574,Santhosh Kumar Loganathan,27/08/2019,Walmart,They don't honor the shipping dates. The customer service is great specifically for price matching.
4006,44629,Corey Valor,27/08/2020,Walmart,Very easy place to shop at. Had a lot of different things and a bunch of friendly staff.
4007,44630,Melissa Brewer,27/08/2020,Walmart,I went in to Walmart here in Oklahoma City to get a few items there were several employees that at were wearing masks however they were on there chins. If we as consumers are doing our part by wearing them at least the employees of Walmart can wear them correctly. When I spoke to the one of the managers she did not seem that concerned she kept pulling up her mask as well. And to see all Walmart employees wearing different masks and not their store teams colored mask just does not look right.
4008,44631,cheryl pressler,27/08/2020,Walmart,ZERO A BIG FAT ZERO! 1 IS WAY TO HIGH OF A NUMBER TO GIVE TO THIS WORTHLESS SYSTEM....MY CHILD ORDERED A SANE DAY PICKUP WITH A GIFT CARD AND IT GOT PUT ON A 48HR FRAUD HOLD....WELL 72 HRS LATER NOW A SYSTEM ERROR AND HE HAS TO CANCEL IT THESE PPL AND SYSTEM ARE BEYOND WORTHLESS AND DONT KNOW THEIR BUTT FROM A HOLE IN THE GROUND! WILL NEVER USE THIS SYSTEM AGAIN!
4009,44632,Deborah,27/08/2020,Walmart,"I just bought a Dritz quilters frame. It's a floor frame. If you can believe this one, there is a cancer warning on the box, yes an actual cancer and reproductive harm warning on the box. Why the heck would walmart of all places sell such a thing. I have taken a picture of this warning for proof."
4010,44633,Alexandra,27/08/2020,Walmart,"The absolut rudest people on the phone. I don't even understand how this company got so big with such hostile, rude, uneducated people claiming to be ""supervisors"". I ordered a sectional 3 weeks ago and was promised delivery twice and only when I called to check on the order they ""offered"" me a refund in a way that made me feel guilty for asking about it. Never mind I believed for 3 weeks I am getting a sectional, took twice off from work to receive it....simply unvelievable . I will never deal with them again and bash them everywhere."
4011,42666,Alison Green,27/08/2021,Walmart,"Horrendous!  God for it if the idiotic drivers they use can't find your place. They just drop it anywhere.

Also, please get people who can speak and understand ENGLISH for your customer service reps!!!!"
4012,42667,Rich,27/08/2021,Walmart,"DO NOT USE WALMART.COM ! Bad Customer Service! and SCAM! I make 2 purchases at Walmart.com and both had issue with them. First online order was for a car tire, paid online and when I picked it up, found it was wrong size and I asked to return right away but customer service at the store said that I have to contact Walmart.com. I was at the store on the phone with Walmart.com customer service for almost 2 hours with lots of holding and finally they said call back, they did't know why the store was not accept the return. The second order was for a heating element sold by the 3rd party through Walmart.com, they provide a tracking shown that order delivered 7 days before the estimate delivery date but it never delivered, contact customer service and she said carrier scan and marked as delivered 2 days before it actually delivered and asked to call back after 2 days and they will refund if I still not receive it. Call back and they said it is marked as delivered and refuse to refund. Never ever use Walmart.com any more !!!"
4013,42668,HGeeTV Sims,27/08/2021,Walmart,"-5ðŸ˜¡Star rating. Phoenix Arizona Walmart on Bethany Home RD and others. I used to love shopping at Walmart but after the rude customer service, filthy bathrooms, spoiled produce and non compliant OSHA standards I am no longer a customer at Walmart. I have had many of the workers completely ignore me and some have been out right confrontational. I give respect an patience to everyone all the time, but I have not had the luxury of receiving it in return from most of the employees at these stores. Iâ€™m a walk away kind of person because I enjoy peace. I bought a cake for my daughter it was ugly and it didnâ€™t taste good. I also ordered one online an, on the day of my son birthday he had no cake because the order wasnâ€™t filled. The bathrooms are so filthy Iâ€™d rather pee on myself than to use there facility. Some of the employees are so comfortable with there lackadaisical and mean demeanor to the point where the racism is so obvious you canâ€™t miss it. For me, never ever again!"
4014,40175,Sajid,27/08/2022,Walmart,What a third class customer services they have. I'm facing a issue from 2 month related my payment method. I'm contacting continuously but there is no one who can solve. Even they are saying you can purchase in-store instead of online purchasing. Pathetic services.
4015,40195,Sanny Grg,27/08/2022,Walmart,"Bought a phone from walmart.com, Third party sold the phone and received defect phone. I tried to return or replace it but they refused to do that. Walmart has worst service & business. Scamming millions pf people. B**S***! :("

4017,40288,Robbin,27/08/2022,Walmart,"I went to Walmart in Clinton, MS to buy two new Goodyear tires. I purchased the tires for my SUV and had the technicians put the tires on and balance them. I then took my vehicle to have the alignment done. A few months later I went back to Walmart to get an additional tire for the rear so that I can had a regular size as my spare. When I got to the same Walmart Auto Center in Clinton, MS. The technician that went to put on the rear tire asked me where did I get the front tires and he said they put the wrong size tires on my car. They replaced the tires and the tires did not last me a year. These tires I purchased new tires and then on August 18th 2022 I went to get my regular oil change at another place. They lifted my car up in the ramp and showed me the wire exposed on my front tires on the inside of my front tires only, The technician stated my alignment was off and it wore my tires wrong. I had to pay for new tires again and alignment. Do Not Trust Walmart. They are stupid to offer services of any kind on vehicles. There technician can't read numbers, they don't check their work and they don't want to fix any of their errors. I contacted because I don't normally have to buy tires every year but due to the error and stupidity I am out buying tires again. When I contacted them around the 21st of August sent them the receipt they would not take any responsibility. Instead they kept asking me stupid questions like, do I still have the old tires. What would I be doing with the old tires. I was on a road trip and them incompetent people expected me to travel across states with two tires in the back of my SUV. I paid for a warranty on the tires that were put on my vehicle and then they don't HONOR ANYTHING. How ridiculous Into ride around with bad tires in your vehicle. After this experience I wouldn't let Walmart Auto Center anywhere to any one of my vehicles again. Word to the wise check all of Walmarts work they are always trying to over. I could have had an accident in my car not knowing that those tires were bad and wearing only on the inside of my front two tires. The technician that found the issue said riding around with the wrong size tire and then switching to the correct size should have gotten another alignment. No one at Walmart told me that. Incompetent and Idiot and I am past pissed. Don't mess with Walmart Auto Center they don't honor their work or back the incompetent employees that they hire."

4019,46569,S Morrison,28/08/2019,Walmart,Visited the North Lauderdale store on 25 August. Once in the fast queue to pay for 10/20 items or less I was appalled by the wait to be served. This was due the family in front having some sort issue. We were eventually served by a lady called Rhona who was rude and unhelpful and did not apologise for the delay and when asked by my mother what the delay was nearly bit my motherâ€™s head off!! She urgently needs further training as her people skills leave much to be desired plus she was slower than a snail. I would not go back to this branch due to this ladyâ€™s shoddy service and will probably check out other branches in future as she put me off and obviously does not enjoy her job. Coming from England I had heard so much great things about Walmart thatâ€™s why I went but on the plus side there is a lot to choose from and you can find basically everything there.

Called the rep and canceled the transaction, she confirmed with an email. Then another email came and said the item has been shipped. Very dishonest practices and a corrupted company. Extremely disappointed. Shame on Walmart."

I thought that was ok and bought two bushels of tomatoes expecting to get my order in time to can tomatoes.

4026,42661,Christine Hickey,28/08/2021,Walmart,I shop often at Walmart and have a Service dog many times I have been harassed for him having to be off leash due to my in ability to hold his leash or tether him to me for his and my safety. I have seen countless dogs in carts as well as aggressive dogs these put my health and safety at risk. I would also like to comment on the self check out my store in particular has only 4 check out spots that are not self check. These lines go out into the way and take hours to get through this is not a fault of employee just of company management. Self check is also not accessible for those with certain disabilities such as those that are visually impaired or have mobility issues will no longer be able to shop at your stores.
4027,42662,Cristina Miranda,28/08/2021,Walmart,"TERRIVEL SERVICE OR A FRAUD???Walmart offer the product, you buy, they place your order, charging you credit card and few minutes later they cancel the order and let you know that your money is going to be available JUST in 7 days. They are holding your money. Is this a kind of fraud? Seems to me that it is."
4028,42663,Genesta Humphrey,28/08/2021,Walmart,"I've noticed the recent mention of changing to entirely self-checkout. I hope you are all taking into consideration that some people, such as a disabled person like me, are not able to use self check out, or it may be inconvenient. I have severe anxiety, and self check out not only makes me extremely anxious and feel vulnerable but on some days where I'm extra shakey due to my anxiety, using self check out can be a battle. Please keep this in mind before you truly change to entirely self check out. It's not exactly disability friendly."
4029,42664,Kig Okey,28/08/2021,Walmart,"Hey, did you know that in terms of male human and female PokÃ©mon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible PokÃ©mon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3""03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human pains, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other PokÃ©mon comes close with this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat + high HP pool + Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more."
4030,42665,Guest,28/08/2021,Walmart,"Pushing the edge on ""bait and switch"" with Shark vacuum purchase. I paid full price for new machine and was sent a refurbished model. Very nice phone customer service but upset had to use them at all since I did nothing wrong, even according to them."

4032,40180,judy steinfeldt,28/08/2022,Walmart,"I ordered heavy swivel gliders with an extra charge added on for assembly on my patio. FedEx dropped off the huge box but numerous calls to customer service yielded no plans for assembly. The only way they will refund the purchase is if I lift a 170 pound box which is dumped in my front yard, rent a uhaul and return it to the store. We are talking about $700 folks.They also explained that even if that were possible, they deduct another $ 26 for their inability to send someone for the assembly. As far as I am concerned I count their assembly add on as fraud. There is no one to assemble. Now what do I do? Every time I call I get someone from yet another country."
4033,40259,Brianna Nicole,28/08/2022,Walmart,They are absolutely amazing! Always have good service and great employment clientele to help you with all of your merchandise needs!

No carts anywhere except all over parking lot, nobody monitoring for masks! You obviously donâ€™t care about your employees allowing well over the number of people in a store at one time. Not sure why they would stay loyal when you show them no loyalty!!!!"
4038,44617,Louisa,29/08/2020,Walmart,They cancel sale priced items then allow regular priced orders to go thru  They also support BLM which is a racist organisation they also are the ones looting Walmart's so how can you support a group that is looting your stores so weird and borderline communist! Why can't they just be against fascism as a whole! Do they not know who their customer base is they are trying to appeal to the woke crowd but the woke crowd aren't buying from Walmart the ones who do buy go to wholefoods and the rest just loot! Fools
4039,44618,Kaiah Lyric,29/08/2020,Walmart,"This is the 3rd time I have bought something on sale from walmart.com and had my order cancelled. I call and am told I can go into the store and pay full price for it because it is now no longer on sale. Isn't that some sort of bait and switch that is illegal? They take your money when you place the order. Then you wait to have it fulfilled so you can go into the store and get it. Then they cancel the order because the item went off sale and tell you, you have to pay full price."
4040,44619,Teb Tano,29/08/2020,Walmart,Worst customer service EVER. Calling them is like draining your life out. Different person different response. After 9th person on the phone for my replacement item is enough. I finally decided to cancel and NEVER will be shopping at Walmart.com or in the store.  Is there like Negative star? Stars only represent that is something right!
4041,44620,Oleg,29/08/2020,Walmart,"Initially I left a nice review to the Walmart store in Linden because of friendly employees working there. However later I changed my mind. Walmart.com locked my account without any prior notifications. When I called them, customer service told that I made ""too many returns"" (around 50 percent) and then hang up. I called second time and the customer service provided different reason, without much explanation. Then they promised to contact me via email and nobody contacted me yet. Well it is a good reason to give a try to better store like Target etc. Good bye walmart."
4042,44621,Edward Torak,29/08/2020,Walmart,Be VERY VERY careful buying anything at Walmart.com. If you try to return the item you bought to a Walmart store you might not get a refund for your item. If Walmart's computer system is unable to print out a return label for the item you purchased online you are out of luck and will be stuck keeping the item even if the item is defective. This happen to me and now I am stuck with a defective chainsaw. IN FACT YOU MIGHT WANT TO BUY YOUR ITEM AT A DIFFER STORE TO AVOID THIS HAPPENING TO YOU!
4043,44622,Robert Green,29/08/2020,Walmart,It was ok my order took a little longer than in amazon
4044,44623,Jim Marnell,29/08/2020,Walmart,"I have been on the phone with Walmart all day and in the end, my order was cancelled by them for some unknown reason. I won't bore you with details except to say I was on the phone with Customer Careless, (mis)manager of the Pick-up & DeliveryDept. of the store on South Columbus Blvd, Philadelphia, about six or seven times during the day. And despite assurances the delivery was in progress, each time it did not turn out the way I was promised. I called the store assistant manager, Felix, to complain and was told he would pick up but 50 minutes later he had not. I spoke to employees who said they heard the same complaints as I had over and over with nothing getting done about it. Walmart has turned into a joke. If you look through this site, ratings average one and one half stars. Trust me, there's a reason. Save yourself aggravation and stay as far away as possible. It is a complete nuthouse."
4045,36432,Maria T.,29/08/2018,Amazon Go,"Very neat!  Get the app, scan your phone upon entry, get yo' sh!t and get out! (Don't worry, they'll email you your receipt to show what you bought, how much they charged you, etc.)  Small selection but basically has everything you really need from a grocery store (beer, gum, chips, sandwiches, cut up fruit, yogurt, frozen meals, bread, premade meals like couscous and pasta, soda, etc.). Items are reasonably priced. Paper bags are provided at no charge in case you forgot your reusable bag.  For a limited time, you can get a free orange, canvas tote with Amazon Go on it. One per person.  Make sure you don't pick up an item and hand it to someone else. You might get charged for this. Always put back what you don't want.  Quite nice for introverts or people in a hurry!"
4046,42658,Elizabeth Zuelke,29/08/2021,Walmart,"Back in June I ordered a grill for my husband. I received a message from the supplier that the grill could not be delivered because the last one was damaged. The message said I would be refunded my money. It also said to ignore any tracking info because it had already been entered. At first, Walmart refunded the money. Then they charged me for the grill again and refused to remove the charge. I first went through their customer service line. They did not understand what I tried to tell them so they said I had to talk to my bank. I disputed the charges but over a month later, Walmart sent 9 pages of what they said was documentation that the grill was delivered. This was the tracking info the first message told me to ignore. Now the charges are back even though I sent them a copy of the message I got from them in the first place. It is outrageous. They don't even read their own messages to the customer. I will NEVER order anything else from them again. Buyer beware."
4047,42659,Brooke Burridge,29/08/2021,Walmart,"CHECK YOUR ORDER - Placed a delivery order through Walmart.com for 2 Day or Next Day Delivery. After process my order I found out it had been changed to Pick-up at a Store that is further than my local Walmart store. With disabilities, illness and not being able to drive at this time, the inconvenience of dealing with platitudes (no matter how kindly given,) and requiring me to do additional steps to correct a problem they created, it was too much and I cancelled the order and asked them to refund the purchase."
4048,42660,mattya,29/08/2021,Walmart,Went to Walmart in Greensboro NC Store#01824 yesterday & upon exiting around 12:10 pm the greeter screamed put your mask on. I wasn't sure whether she was yelling at me. The front sign states masks are recommended not mandatory. There was no reason to yell at customers in this manner. It was humiliating!! In addition the shelves were empty the bathrooms filthy the parking lot had numerous filthy masks on the ground. Kind of hypocritical. As a long time customer I will now shop elsewhere where paying customers are treated with respect.
4049,40201,Janos Polereczki,29/08/2022,Walmart,I bought the week ago smooked neckbone in Walmart. I took few pictures at home. Look!!!!! Unfortunately few products are badshape and expired on the selfes. Be careful during the shopping.
4050,40228,Cilque Chavis,29/08/2022,Walmart,"I attempted to order a refrigerator on line. I paid for it with my debit card. Within ten minutes the order was cancelled citing too much activity on card (WHAT?) I spoke with customer service who told me that cleared out everything and I could re-enter it. Within ten minutes it was cancelled again, citing the same thing. I called again and the same thing. Now my bank is holding over $500 for three cancelled orders that Walmart still has pending even though I have all the cancelled emails. I'm now told it can take up to 5-7 business days for the credit to be sent to my bank. Even had my bank on the phone with Walmart and my bank told them there has been no credit by Walmart. Theft by deception. You can't use my money for seven days. The cancellation states I would not be charged!. I ended up ordering from someone else and it is already shipped!. BEWARE OF WALMART."
4051,46566,Anonymous,30/08/2019,Walmart,Walmart.com should review their vendors products before selling them..They should not say 2 day shipping if they don't stand behind it.This happen many times.Spend $58 on a garden bench. Recd with no bubble wrap or packaging with it. Their vendors should pack merchandises correctly. Box was damage..Garden bench look like a kid toy. I have to waste my time to go to Walmart and return it.. Will be canceling my Walmart card.
4052,44613,Doug Wendt,30/08/2020,Walmart,"Walmart grocery pick up has a poor system. 1st attempt, I waited 35 minutes with no luck. Had to leave and come back. 2nd attempt, Tried calling for over 20 minutes to check in to no avail. Had to stand in front of the door to force someone to talk to me just to check in. They probably donâ€™t have enough staff working. But I guess they prefer you to shop inside? It would certainly be faster."
4053,44614,D Lowe,30/08/2020,Walmart,"Due to CIVID19 I have tried to shop online with home delivery. Wal-Mart has been such a disappointment. I've received broken jars of Alfredo sauce, crushed cereal and chips because large heavy items pack in same box without packing, etc. Today I received an order that should have included cookies, instead I received allergy pills. I will not pay to return something due to Wal-Mart's poor order processing. I also shop online through Sam's Club and haven't had any problems."
4054,44615,Nikita Kesav,30/08/2020,Walmart,"Worst store ever. Why have so big of a store and so many departments when no one is there to even assist the customers. Useless and the biggest waste of time in my life. The most inconvenient store for customers, itâ€™s had itâ€™s time in success and itâ€™s now long gone."
4055,36151,Cliveocr,30/08/2019,Amazon Go,"Cute Store-Easy Check Out Once I sorted out the Amazon Go app and remembered my password, I was good to go. It's relatively small shop (not restaurant) and prices were reasonable. I did the tourist thing and bought a mug :-)"
4056,42657,Porcelain Reed,30/08/2021,Walmart,"They tried to make me return food items to the store for a refund when I stated that the quality of the foods they gave me for pickup was horrible. Donâ€™t ever do this especially during a pandemic which could lead to a deadly cross contamination. Beware anytime you purchase food from a drive-thru, restaurant or from a market or store of any kind never allow them to force you to return it. The federal laws make it illegal once you have received food from any establishment to return any type of food products due to cross contamination and because it cannot be resold or used due to the fact you could have tampered with it or puts drugs in it."
4057,40161,Anne Pliskaner,30/08/2022,Walmart,"The manager, Bev at the Cranberry store was horrible with her customer service skills. They were short staffed, as is the whole United States right now, so there were no cashiers. However, there were many employees walking around the store, mostly walking in front of me. The shelves were empty, and Bev really didnâ€™t seem to care that her several self checkout help kept walking away. Never again will I shop at that Walmart."
4058,40164,Akbar,30/08/2022,Walmart,"Walmart in Mi, Flint, Corunna rd, Installed the WRONG TIRES ON MY 2017 HYBRID, THE MANAGERS THERE FOR THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT ARE COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT! I BROUGHT MY CAR BACK THE NEXT DAY AFTER THEY INSTALLED BRAND NEW TIRES AND TOLD THEM THE TIRES RIDE AND HANDLE TERRIBLE, FELT UNSAFE. THEY WOULD NOT ORDER THE CORRECT TIRES OR REFUND ME! DISCOUNT TIRE ROCKS, COST ME MORE MONEY BUT THEY WAS FAST AND ORDERED THE RIGHT TIRES, OHH YEAH THERE EMPLOYEES WAS TO BUSY OH THERE CELL PHONES TO HELP US WAL-MART THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY"
4059,40172,Shanley,30/08/2022,Walmart,Went to Walmart to purchase a few things and ended up with a shoplifting charge after spending over 200.00 just because I forgot something was under my buggy. Never ever ever will I go back there and if I can sue I definitely plan to.
4060,40200,Anthony Bellamy,30/08/2022,Walmart,"I wrote a review and deleted it earlier. My conscience said it needed to be said. I have family and friends who work for this company. I was recently in Store #4664 and had a horrible experience. The cashier on the phone checking and sending text messages while I am trying to cash out. She doesn't speak but I did. She gives me my total and receipt. No thank you, no have a nice day, nothing. Walmart needs to change this. Associates having their phones at the register or on them should be a no. Even down to listening to music while they are working. The music in the store should be good enough for them to work with. Also, the male associates need to pull their pants up. I don't want to see all that while i am shopping. They don't like change or their jobs, let them go or QUIT and find something else."

4064,47032,Art Conklin,31/08/2018,Walmart,"Ordered item was returned without warning. Miscommunications. Poor customer service.  Ordered (online) small tool for delivery to store. Email announcing availability received. Given one week to pick up. Six days later got an email warning that the tool would be returned the following day. While enroute to the store walmart.com sent another email that the item had been returned - which I discovered when I arrived at the store. Assistant manager did not care - no explanation - nothing. ""You'll have to reorder."" As if it was a separate company. Spoke to Walmart.com rep who was apologetic and offered discount coupon on future order (over a certain amount). Not a good solution for me."
4065,46562,Alva Henry,31/08/2019,Walmart,"African American shop at Walmart store, you need to have more of us working, Walmart orientation I attended there were 12 hires, I was the only African American, they hire me for the hardest department the deli, I am 59 years old the slicing machine was hard to use it damage my shoulder and then they fire me, about 20 people working in the deli I was the only black in the department, sorry to say I had no support,Walmart gives the elderly workers the hard department, I apply for couple department, they called me for Deli, Young workers got easier department, they are young they can use the slicer four hours without break, Walmart I did not come to work because I could not move my shoulder I am still in pain with no job , I will lose my house I am the only caregiver for my disabled son, the last day I work I was the only worker left to close the deli a three worker job."

It has been a month and no TV. Walmartâ€™s solution: Refund. Good Luck."
4067,46564,Patricia,31/08/2019,Walmart,Had a very bad experience with Walmart. Got eggs and all the eggs were rotten. Never go to Walmart. Instead choose an alternative.

Stacy Norman"
4069,44607,Mary Nouneh El-Giries,31/08/2020,Walmart,"Very bad customer service in the store and on the phone. When we ask a question to an agent they give any answer even when it is wrong. When I call to unlock my password online, I stay one hour and a half, with no answer until I give up and hang the phone. as if it is a lost and not useful"
4070,44608,michael kim,31/08/2020,Walmart,"Walmart's online delivery might be the most garbage and inconsistent online service I have ever had. Upon ordering an item last week, it has already been delayed FOUR different times in the span of it's initial purchase. Not only that, but Walmart also provides no useful context of what is happening with your order. It will say transit and that it is in your city, but then for me it got delayed TWICE after it said it was in transit in my city. If I could give a negative star, I would. Walmart provides essentially no feedback as to time of arrival, as they seem to just delay as they please, without any explanation why. This delaying process should not be able to occur FOUR times. It just shows how garbage Walmart is in terms of online delivery."
4071,44609,Viplov Singh,31/08/2020,Walmart,Extremely horrible service. You kept delaying the delivery date at your whims and with no update. Itâ€™s been an absolute worst experience and I would much rather walk through the entire country to get my product than ever use Walmart again. If only it was possible to give a lower rating than a single star.
4072,44610,Andrea Kennedy,31/08/2020,Walmart,"I am sending your company an email voicing my displeasure with Walmart making facemasks mandatory to shop in Airdrie & Canada. Since the start of the ""pandemic"" I continued to support Walmart and complied with guidelines of physical distancing, washing hands, etc. which by the way, is the RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES by health officials. Excessive measures that you have implemented now, has forced people like me to shop elsewhere. I am very disheartened with your decision to cater to panic and the customers that are terrified of this virus. There are 6 people that I personally know that have made the choice of shopping elsewhere and our money and number will be of no consequence to your profit, I felt it was necessary to let you know I am not alone in my frustration and decision. I would like to know how many Walmart employees and/or customers contracted COVID prior to this decision. I have not heard of any cases/closing of a store but that is, of course the big corporations mentality."
4073,44611,Kristin Coon,31/08/2020,Walmart,"DO NOT buy a major appliance from Walmart.com!!! I ordered a dishwasher from Walmart.com. When the order was confirmed, the ship date was over a month away. That was not acceptable, so I cancelled it immediately - the next day. But Walmart said the dishwasher had already shipped and they couldn't cancel. How could it have shipped within 24 hours, but not be scheduled to get to me until a month later?? Spent HOURS on the phone trying to cancel the order, and every time I spoke with someone I had to explain the situation all over again. The process was ridiculous!! Two weeks and several phone calls later, the shipment was cancelled and a credit was issued to my credit card, but the third party vendor Walmart used charged me a 15% restocking fee ($193!). Walmart customer service was always friendly and reassuring when I spent hours on the phone with them, but essentially they did nothing. I am still on the phone trying to recover the restocking fee. Now they are telling me I should have looked closer at the third party vendor fine print, I should have known there would be a restocking fee. I thought I was dealing with Walmart, but now they are saying I am dealing with the third party vendor, who is impossible to contact. I will NEVER buy anything from Walmart.com again!!"
4074,44612,eileen samoy,31/08/2020,Walmart,I HATE YOU WALMART!!!!!! YOUR EMPLOYEES BARKED AND TRIED TO EAT ME AND MY CHILD FOR NO REASON WE DIDNT EVEN DO ANYTHING AT ALL HOW COULD YOU WALMART?!?!

4075,36247,Danica S.,31/08/2018,Amazon Go,"came here in opening day and it was busy! Thankfully there were employees prepping people and explaining the process before entering the store. I was shocked with the variety of pre made food selection. There was a small area for medicinal items, and dinner kits to take home for $20. Most of us felt a little awkward walking out with our items, but recieved Amazon receipts immediately after leaving the store. Swipe for the option to return or report a problem. We were impressed with how quickly we received a reply to our questions. Well done Amazon, WELL DONE!"
4076,36431,Chris N.,31/08/2018,Amazon Go,This place is amazing. You can walk in and get what you need without the hassle of long checkout lanes or knowing where everything is because of how small the store is. The employees are very polite and professional. They will even go out of their way to help you find what you need.
4077,36424,Andy C.,31/08/2019,Amazon Go,"Dimitri, one of the employees, was so friendly and helpful to us. He even mentioned to us that Amazon had a newer store down the street similar to Target. He provided tons more information about Amazon Go and the concept behind it. We will be back when we're in Seattle!"
4078,42655,Bees,31/08/2021,Walmart,"I've been using Walmart.com delivery service for several years, but the last few months something has changed with the way they are shipping the product which makes absolutely no sense! They have been dividing my orders and having delivery people from other companies drop off single items, IE. I had a delivery of (1) can of pumpkin puree which costs $2.08 dropped at my doorstep instead of being included with the rest of my orders? I honestly can't see how this can be cost effective for Walmart? This has happened on numerous occasions even after I have sent them emails. I'm not sure if they are trying to keep up with Amazon, but delivering 6 items of an order on 4-5 different days is just plain stupid!"
4079,42656,Tina VanWagenen,31/08/2021,Walmart,"I was in Walmart in Cortland 08/30/21. Since there were only two checkouts open and the lines were very long I chose to go to the self check out area. The ""watcher"" was staring at me, which made me feel uncomfortable. I was purchasing school supplies. When I put the 5 subject notebook in the bag she came right over and said ""how many notebooks are you putting in your bag"". I said one and had to lift it out the bag to prove to her I was not steeling. If you don't trust people to cash themselves out, HIRE SOME CASHIERS !!! I WILL NOT RETURN TO THE STORE AFTER BEING MADE TO FEEL LIKE A THIEF !!!"
4080,40160,Dave,31/08/2022,Walmart,"Ordered tires off the website only to have them canceled because the order didn't pass some ""security check.""I call customer service and end up with some non english speaking zipper head who can't tell me why. All they cqn do is read some canned blah blah blah response over and over. So Walmarts competitor made a $ 600 sale off of me the next day"
4081,40191,Rene Harris,31/08/2022,Walmart,When my husband placed an online order. It was confirmed they took the money from my husband's account and then turned around and sold our order and canceled our order. Thats crappie.
4082,40198,Carri Mortenson,31/08/2022,Walmart,"I pay for the Walmart + premium membership. I placed an order yesterday for delivery. Usually don't have this big of a problem. I never got the order last night. Called and was told I would get an email today to select a time to receive my order. That never happened. Called this afternoon and was told the order would be here between 6-7 yet no notification of the change was ever received. I called again tonight and was told that the store hadn't assigned a driver and wouldn't. The only option I had was to wait and see if it comes, or cancel. The customer service I received was so horrible that I not only canceled the order but I also canceled the Walmart + premium membership. I usually place 2-4 orders a week. No more! I guess I will pay a little more to get quality service from Instacart or Amazon. NEVER AGAIN!"

4084,47020,Babar,13/09/2018,Walmart,"I bought a vacuum couple years ago and it stopped working after 3 months and I took it to the Walmart and they said itâ€™s under the companyâ€™s warranty and just call them, So I called the company and they have very rude and disrespectful people there calling them was a no help at all, so I waited for my Walmart warranty to work so I can contact them but they were no help as well with the return. I talked to them for hours on the phone and they transferred my calls to at 4 different people and they said Iâ€™ve to donate it and then email the receipt for a return, but I didnâ€™t have time to go donate so I got an email saying that my thing has expired and to renew it Iâ€™ve to call them and went through all the process of transferring and at the end they just told me that it is expired and there no way to return it. So basically both my warrantyâ€™s were not useful at all and I would not recommend anyone to buy a vacuum or anything else that might stop working in the future."
4085,46525,Anisha,13/09/2019,Walmart,"So being cheapðŸ˜, i decided to pick up some black beans from Walmart instead of getting them from publix or in a bag. I guess because I've never had a issue with can goods, it didn't seem like i was embarking on a horrible journey into the unknown. Imagine yourself, throwing some apple smoked bacon in the pot with some onions, seasons, and black beans. Letting that thang simmer with just a touch of butter, ðŸ¤¤ðŸ˜‹ mmm yesssss honey! Imagine taking a big spoon of those black beans and spreading them over some jasmine rice. I had grilled some ribs but i was only feeling the beans and rice. Imagine taking a big bite of those black beans and chewing and chewing and ouch! What's that?? That can't be a bone?! Now imagine back tracking what you cooked, how you cooked it and realizing on your third bite that you didn't put anything but BONELESS bacon in the black beans! Oh God take the wheel!!! Now imagine ALL the things you could be eating BESIDES black beans! Tell me how in the hellovit, did Walmart just package up a unauthorized extra ingredient in my black beans????? And then to top it off, instead of sending me a$50/$100 gift card to buy some groceries to replace my time, food and stomachðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®(threw up multiple times), they insult me with a WHOPPING $5 dollarsðŸ¥ºgift card to spend at Walmart, the money I spent on the 4 pack minus tax! Imagine the trauma im experiencing, just knowing some rodent was seasoned up, simmered, baconed up and in my mouth. . . .ðŸ¤¢. . . ðŸ¤®sorry a throw up break. . . Walmart yall gotta do better! Make me feel like y'all was sorry, I have vowed to spend the extra 0.12 cents at Publix, my sister told me, when you pay for quality you get better but when you pay for cheapness you get RATS!!!!

4086,46526,Dee,13/09/2019,Walmart,This is about the photo center. I ordered photos one hour service it took three days and put in a complaint. About two months later I ordered photos to be mailed to me that they lost in shipping them delivered four weeks later. Walmart is the worst for photos ordering for pick up and deliver. Pictures of your two year old will show up when the child is 16!!! They ayte the worst for pick up at the store as well for photos and merchandise. You check in and stand there for hours waiting for no one to come help you. Will never order photos again or merchandise to be picked up.
4087,44552,Robert Grendahl,13/09/2020,Walmart,"On 9-6-20 I put a delivery order in for groceries to be delivered. I pressed place order and it deducted the money from my account and went back to the shopping cart. Didnt get a confirmation or anything. Called after a couple hours to see if they knew what was going on, they told me there was a glitch in their system and the money would be back in a couple hours. Called back after about 6 hours and tallked to someone else, he told me it could take up to 3 days for it to go back into my account. It is now 7 days later and they still havent refunded my money. Be aware of the delivery..."
4088,44553,Goober s,13/09/2020,Walmart,"Multiple signs out front including a huge one clearly state that masks are required. They even have someone stationed inside the door for the ostensible purpose of enforcing the rule. When I complained about the 1/3 of customers and roughly 20% of employees not following the rule, I was told by the guard that she had been instructed to not enforce the companyâ€™s rule. When I told her to take the signage down, she told me that decision rested elsewhere. In other words, the store manager is too ignorant or too lazy to look at any of the dozens of cameras in their store to see what is happening or they have the authority to overrule company policy with impunity. Walmart does not care if customers and employees that are too stupid or belligerent to understand that masks are not for their benefit but they are intended for the life safety of those they encounter in the store. Walmart - enforce your policies or take the signs down. Based on this experience, I do not feel safe in this store and would advise anyone with any concern about COVID to stay out of this place."
4089,44554,Ursula Glissmann,13/09/2020,Walmart,"Walmart doesn't get it. Website won't function correctly. Shipping is terrible. Broken up in many deliveries. Charges to my card broken up too. Groceries out of stock. Then they keep asking me too tip when I already have tipped. Etc, etc."
4090,44555,Joy Pilcher,13/09/2020,Walmart,I went to Calhoun GA Walmart this morning. Mask are mandatory. Nobody cares. They have only 1 door open and a health ambassador close to the door. About half the people in there didn't have mask and some employees didn't have them on correctly. Too many people in the store and no one followed the aisle directions. Why pay the extra staff if nothing is going to be done?
4091,44556,Richard Lincoln,13/09/2020,Walmart,It took 6 months for them to complete my order. The items I ordered came in different packages. I never received any correspondence from them. There tracking system was not used friendly.
4092,44557,George Gegeshidze,13/09/2020,Walmart,Bought 4 tires in a single order got charged 205$ next day Iâ€™m receiving an notification on my phone that 153$ was authorized to Walmart I checked order details turned out they have changed the quantity of tires from 4 to 3 then I tried to cancel the order but it canceled only one Didnâ€™t cancel all of the tires I called customer service they told me it was entirely my fault and they wouldnâ€™t change anything so Iâ€™m getting only three tire for decoration . The Worst experience ever!
4093,44558,Randi Rae,13/09/2020,Walmart,"Placed an order on 9/10 and it was supposed to arrive 9/12. Fedex tracking shows they had not shipped it yet, only created the shipping label. Opened a chat with them online to find out where it was. Ivan was completely useless. He checked the same tracking link I checked and said it had shipped. I asked to be bumped up to a manager or higher support tier. He refused. I understand that delays are common with Covid. I only asked to find out where my package was and instead I got a frustrating run-around from someone who wasn't really a customer service agent."
4094,42595,Kerr,13/09/2021,Walmart,"I gave it a 1 because my shipment came in 2 deliveries. The first, the delivery person rang door bell as well as called to inform me that the package was there. The 2 delivery came at the time of a storm outside, NO DOORBELL NO CALL NO EMAIL!!! I had no idea, til I left for work in the AM that it was sitting on the porch, not even left in the covered part. Soak everthing was wet."
4095,42596,Stephanie Harrison,13/09/2021,Walmart,"The ""new"" website is horrific! Seriously, horrific. Mixing Pickup AND .com is a disaster. Having to filter for Pickup Only after every. single. search is infuriating. I click on the item I want, and it shoves it in the ""shipping"" cart if I forget to filter. I DON'T WANT STUFF SHIPPED. Seriously, have someone who actually SHOPS THE SITE make the site!"
4096,42597,Mary Carter,13/09/2021,Walmart,The new website is terrible. I canâ€™t navigate to pickup like I use to be able to. Now itâ€™s a hybrid of grocery and .com stuff. And I have to either scroll through it all or filter every single item I search for. No thank you!!!!  And letâ€™s not even talk about their 1-800 customer service. They were zero help. They knew nothing about the website. They wouldnâ€™t even ATTEMPT to help me navigate it. I talked to two people before I completely gave up and called a manager at my local store. The manager at least attempted to help me.  Walmart! Get it together! I find myself shopping there less and less.
4097,42598,A-T,13/09/2021,Walmart,"Website new design 100% sucks. Hard to find items and most items are out of stock for some reason that are actually sold by Walmart in store. BIGGEST PROBLEM is the fact my saved items and shopping cart full of items I planned to buy days later is now gone. I can't even remember everything I had in my shopping cart or saved items. Trying to find the items is a headache. Especially since I researched some items before adding them to my cart/saved items. Walmart is very deceptive, acting like your shopping cart disappeared and saved items missing now is no big deal. No warning, of the features of saved items and shopping cart items gone. I am 100% pissed off for wasting my time on Walmart.com! Keep in mind I usually purchase from Walmart.com by weekly. Yeah that's over with."
4098,42599,Rebecca Q.,13/09/2021,Walmart,"New website threw me for a loop. Less available items than before, and more scammer companies! Beware.

4099,42600,Melissa Thigpen,13/09/2021,Walmart,I was going to try the Affirm thing since Walmart doesnâ€™t do layaway any more. But after reading the horrific reviews Iâ€™ll pass! And figure something else out!! Thinks for the grand inconvience to millions of customers!!! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

4114,47016,Sally,14/09/2018,Walmart,"I have never been one to like Walmart, however, I see that Walmart.com is giving Amazon a run for their money. I have been ordering from Amazon for years but have been becoming more and more disenchanted with them. Tried Walmart.com and found their prices to be very competitive and most of their shipping has been free. Always very fast turn around time. I am now more often ordering from Walmart. Fast, efficient, well priced and good service/support. Very happy"
4115,47017,Laura,14/09/2018,Walmart,Easy and fast... thank you!
4116,47018,Clarence Scott,14/09/2018,Walmart,"The last few orders I made have taken forever to get to my place, for some reason they didn't get the quick shipping for free."
4117,46524,Doreen,14/09/2019,Walmart,"Everyone said ""order online, it's so easy, no hassle"" well I guess they did not mean walmart. My order was due on Thursday, part of it (4 of 13 pieces) arrived and 3 of the 4 bottles of soft cleanser (liquid ) had open caps. The inside of the box and contents were covered in liquid cleanser. I was also informed that the rest of my order was returned to Walmart because it was damaged. Emailed customer service and their response was "" thank your your feedback."" After numerous emails back and forth I was told that my order was being prepared for shipping and would arrive next Wednesday. If walmart has an IQ test on their application than they must hire the ones that fail. I will NEVER order from Walmart.com again.it is not easy and not hassle free. I will glady carry the heavy items and trade my headache for body pain."
4118,46542,Eric Sutton,14/09/2019,Walmart,I didnâ€™t know Walmart was controlled by liberals! Any business that encourages any type of gun control will NOT get my business!
4119,44547,Vahe Messerlian,14/09/2020,Walmart,"Worst online chat experiences. They make you do all the work instead of retrieving information that is already in your system, and then they ask you irrelevant questions from their discussion bank which they plug in without taking the time to read your comments. I will not order from Walmart again."
4120,44548,Dawn Parent,14/09/2020,Walmart,"I went to Walmart to buy a $500 gift card to pay for a processing fee for a grant I was supposedly approved for. Well I did ask a lot of questions and felt comfortable with this particular company who was referred to me through Facebook Messenger. Well when I went to Walmart the lady at the counter would not sell me the card because she felt this was a scam. She also gave me a card with the governments number for scams. I found out that it was a scam and my friend was ""catfished""! Thank you Walmart, you saved me $500!"
4121,44549,Joeseph,14/09/2020,Walmart,There kind of good they dont treat there workers how there supposed to be treated but they also need to keep up with there supplies
4122,44550,G Skier,14/09/2020,Walmart,I put on my first order with Walmart.com because it had an item was about half the price I found in other websites. Waited a week for it and on the delivery date got an email from Walmart saying that the order was canceled. When I called customer service they transfered me to the customer retention department. The lady told me there was nothing she can do and if I wanted the item it would be twice the price and they would not price match and I had to wait another week. She obviously didn't care and the customer retention was bull** because she didn't even try. Never again will I place an order with wallmart.com.
4123,44551,Helen Mark,14/09/2020,Walmart,"I am no longer spending my money at walmart, because company policy states that you support a terror organization and not only support but charge every customer a BLM tax. This will be the demise of Walmart and Sam Walton is turning over in his grave.. SHAME on YOU!!!"
4124,36395,G S.,14/09/2018,Amazon Go,"Fun experience!  I had the APP ready on my device to scan in to enter the store.  Had a great time walking around looking at the products.  I picked up 3 items off the shelves and placed in my reusable shopping bag.  Then I simply walked out of the store.  It felt weird to just walk out.  I opened the APP and magically the receipt for the 3 items was there.  Cool concept - no check out, it's fast and convenient.  I would go here often if I lived close by.  The store itself reminds me of a Whole Foods 7 Eleven."
4125,42582,Cheryl,14/09/2021,Walmart,Lost my nutrition section! Quantities are to large. I hate your new app!
4126,42583,Janine Viktora,14/09/2021,Walmart,I just wanted to say I had the best experience at your Walmart Vision Center at the store in Vadnais Heights. I went in and had a great experience shopping for glasses. Your staff Donna and Ruthanna helped me choose glasses that look great and feel wonderful. I also want to give the manager Chishonna a big shout out. She promotes great customer service and makes each customer feel special. Janine V.
4127,42584,Rick L,14/09/2021,Walmart,Totally confusing and extremely hard to find grocery items. Removed all my favorites completely
4128,42585,Tim Schwent,14/09/2021,Walmart,"Walmart uses Capital One to issue their Walmart Masstercard. Though we had credit ratings of 815 to 820 (until after this fiasco) I (the 815 credit rating) was denied the best rewards card and although I refused to take the lower rewards card I was charged a ""hard inquiry"". We then applied under my wife's name and apparently her cards with Macys, Kohls, Pennys etc did get her the best rewards BUT with only a $300 credit line) We both have a 100% pay on time rating and no derogatory remarks and 2 or less hard inquiries before Capital One. We even have another Capital One credit card with a $26,000 credit limit. Walmart needs to wake up and get a new card handler. We spend over $10,000 with Walmart but it looks like Target will get a new customer."
4129,42586,Deborah Vanlue,14/09/2021,Walmart,Walmart changed its app I can no longer voice text the groceries I have to type in every word it's very time consuming for me. Word up dumbass Walmart you screwed it up
4130,42587,B Higbee,14/09/2021,Walmart,I hate this new app it is so confusing. Please go back to how it was this is terrible!

4132,42589,Walmart Shopper,14/09/2021,Walmart,WTH Walmart! What did you do with the Grocery Website. Without WARNING! The Walmart Grocery interface is gone and has been replaced by Walmart.com. My shopping list is gone. The convenient friendly interface page is gone. The checkout and scheduling my delivery date page is gone. The add and update features on the Grocery Website are gone. PERISHIABLE GROCERY DELIVERY AND MERCHANDISE DELIVERY ARE NOT THE SAME THING! GET YOU ACT TOGETHER!
4133,42590,Stacey Simmons,14/09/2021,Walmart,"Where to begin. Order was promised to be delivered every day until it was a week late. Finally received the order and more than half of the cans were dented. Like they took all the dented cans off a shelf and shipped it to me. Now, trying to return it. They sent me a shipping tag, attached to box and put outside Monday morning as instructed. Box was not picked up on Monday. Put out again Tues and contacted Walmart. After all of this, I am told the box will be picked up Wednesday. Told them I am not bringing the box in and out until they finally get it picked up. Also was promised credit was processed on Friday. Have not seen that either. Done with Walmart. Tired of excuses for every single order being delivered late - even items ordered with 2-day delivery!!!"
4134,42591,Wanda Muterspaugh,14/09/2021,Walmart,Walmart app now mixes in store and online orders. Completely deleted my shopping cart for online Christmas presents that I have saved. The website is such a mess to look up an item. Who has all day to figure out a list? That should be simple and SMOOTH. I hate this!!! Do you all actually shop on Walmart your self? If you did you would know what a mess this is.
4135,42592,Peggy,14/09/2021,Walmart,I will no longer use Walmart grocery pickup until the website becomes more user friendly. I refuse to try to sit and filter and falter through your website just to get an order ready to send. Why make it harder on your customers in a time when life is already hard?!
4136,42593,Estela Williams,14/09/2021,Walmart,"The worse upgrade to an app ever made!!! I have bought through walmart online for over 5 years. But this new app makes so hard to shop, i don't know what to do, where to go next on the app. To make matters worse, when you are finalizing the order, they advertize more products for you to buy so you get so confused and don't know if its done or if there's anything else you need to do. Im so disappointed with this app!!! It's soooo bad!!!"
4137,42594,DL,14/09/2021,Walmart,"Your new website is horrible. It's buggy, laggy, and frequently errors out. We do not want this. Look at your reviews. The new website is horrific. I will be canceling my Walmart delivery service, because now the website is hard to use, and errors out."

4148,40141,Robert DuBois,14/09/2022,Walmart,"One the worst Walmart locations ever! Refused to take my online return because â€œthe return barcode/link had been expiredâ€?! And they literally asked me to solve the problem myself by saying â€œyou call customer serviceâ€. What kind of attitude is that? You guys were supposed to solve YOUR customerâ€™s problem YOURSELVES. Bad experiences didnâ€™t stop there. Their online department was equally bad. I called more than 3 times, they were nice-sounding every time, but never emailed me the return shipping label, without which I could not make the return through mail. You could easily tell this is kind of a hidden selling strategy that secretly prevent clients from returning items especially for a cellphone thatâ€™s worth nearly $1k. In this case since the phone is being financed through my carrier, I couldnâ€™t even file a dispute with my bank, and since the seller is a third party, my carrier wasnâ€™t able to do anything about it. Lesson learned, truth approved, itâ€™s an unreliable retailer, 100% no more shopping at Walmart."

4151,47014,Kevin Coon,15/09/2018,Walmart,"I ordered a bath fan from their website solely because their web page clearly states free 2 day shipping, but when I received order confirmation, it was nearly a week. I contacted support and they stated that 2 day shipping does not apply to 3rd party vendors, but the web page with the item clearly states ""Free 2-day shipping"". They were unwilling to make this right, the web page states this, and is clearly deceptive. I won't make the mistake of shopping there again!"
4152,47015,Susannah Bautista,15/09/2018,Walmart,"Used to be good (briefly) but now it's a joke. And when I say that, I'm referring to the store pickup option. The rest of the website is glitchy garbage with bad search filtering. Don't even get me started on the app (can anyone find the ""order history"" button?). But the store pickup... A few years ago, it used to be that you could order something on the way to Walmart and it would be ready to pick up by the time you got there. Now days, the website will say it's available today... But then you place your order and all of a sudden, it'll be ready 2 weeks from now! For items that are ""in stock"". And here's the kicker, it was never in stock in the first place. After the team goes looking for the item and it ends up not being on the shelf (wow, shocker, who could have known?) they then delay your order. No one is keeping track of stock. And this is the same run around for all 3 Walmarts in my area. You can tell that they've invested in making this service look cool, but they really are having an issue with execution."
4153,46521,Robin may,15/09/2019,Walmart,Walmart employees lied in the store web site had false information and customer service just sit there reading off cards not speaking to me just reading off cards.they were quick enough to take my money but refused to refund it.

4158,42561,Mimi,15/09/2021,Walmart,"This is my follow-up review from the one left yesterday. I tried adding some items to my grocery list for pick-up tomorrow. It was complicated, not as straight forward as before. I clicked on the link in the email that confirmed my order, it took me to my order, I added an item, and then it showed pick up in a town I never heard of in a State far far away!! I tried again, same thing. Also extremely annoying when you find that items will be shipped (and charged!), when all I tried to do was to add items for pick-up, after even having set a pickup time and date. Had to delete the items, go back and search again, and watch very carefully that it was available to pickup. Didn't use to have to do that. What a mess. That has to change. They HAVE to go back to the previous version of grocery.walmart.com site. This new one just isn't working. I'll shop elsewhere until fixed. Way too much frustration."
4159,42562,On Line,15/09/2021,Walmart,"Combining the online shipping with grocery pick up was, bar-none, the WORST idea ever - not sure whi should be fired first, the person who suggested it or the manager who ultimately approved the disaster.... Go back to the separate checkouts!!!!!!"

Stop making changes just for the sake of making changes!"
4161,42564,pearl,15/09/2021,Walmart,if i could give zero stars i would! why did you change the grocery website!? this new website is absolute garbage! just said to husband not shopping here anymore! $350 a week on curbside pickup no more! favorites are all gone! can't add anything unless you choose pickup for every item? can't find single chocolate turtles! im so mad! this is complete bs!

4163,42566,Steve,15/09/2021,Walmart,"This new grocery site is a complete mess while the old site was so simple and easy to use.  Absolutely nothing works as it should, or used to, and your phone service, called them twice today, is completely worthless.  I've been trying to add items to my grocery order all day and keep getting this message ""Sorry, your payment method could not be authorized for an additional amount. Please start a new order to purchase these items."" So, in total frustration, I started a new order, imagine my surprise when I received this message, ""Sorry, your payment method could not be authorized for an additional amount. Please start a new order to purchase these items.""  Chase Bank says my card is fine and it's a Walmart issue. What a shock.  Plus my hundreds of 'Favorites', which took over a year to accumulate, are all gone! Fire the overpaid suits who came up with the absolutely terrible idea of a new site with a unified Grocery/Wamart.com cart and bring the old site back.  Are you getting out of the 'selling stuff' business? Sure seems like you've lost interest! I know I'm starting to."
4164,42567,Marla Devian,15/09/2021,Walmart,New update is AWFUL!!!! So confusing you canâ€™t see which items have delivery free and reviews you have to go to each item to be able to see the reviews why you guys making it so complicated!!!

4166,42570,Jana Mayo,15/09/2021,Walmart,What a cluster blunder on the app!! Itâ€™s like reading a library just to accomplish a simple task!

Then, when looking at my cart, some items have changed back to shipping again!! What a pain! Guess I will go back to Kroger pickup!! Their app and website are very easy to use!!"

4171,42575,Karen Campbell,15/09/2021,Walmart,"Total Fail! 1000% agree with all other reviewers. For grocery pickup customers, the latest update to the website is awful. Needlessly confusing. Have to set the filter for every single search to show only what's available at the store. Added items to my pickup order and the ""available to ship"" items defaulted to shipped. Had to switch them to ""pickup"". Why?  This used to be a godsend for my elderly dad - he could easily order and pick up groceries without worrying about Covid exposure. He gave up on the new website because it was so confusing. Too hard for him to change his shipped items into pickup items. He went into his local Walmart store instead - frustrating him again because he didn't know where everything was and left without getting everything he needed. He said he would never go back and we're looking at an alternative grocery pickup/delivery solution for him.  Walmart, you're losing customers with this one. Give us a way to set our preferences or roll back the recent changes!"

4173,42577,AM,15/09/2021,Walmart,"The new update is awful. The layout is horrific. If I'm trying to order groceries, I want to be able to only look at items they have in the store, not what is available for shipping and what is available for 3-day pickup. In order to see what is available today, you have to select the pickup box from a dropdown menu for every item you look up to add to your order. If your Ibotta is linked, it overlaps information on the website to where you can't see the price. There wasn't anything wrong with the original Walmart grocery app when they first started offering pickup. I prefer it over both updates they have done so far. I plan to use another store's pickup service until this is fixed."
4174,42578,Judy Slosar,15/09/2021,Walmart,"Agree with All the other reviewers. The upgrade is awful. Not user-friendly and takes way too much time to order. Tried to look at a product, pressed options and a ridiculous sized picture popped up. Iâ€™m done and off to Amazon."
4175,42579,NT,15/09/2021,Walmart,New update is too confusing between pickup/delivery/curbside -- all favorited items for reorder have disappeared. Not user friendly at all and needs to be changed back to a separate experience for curbside pickup. When I search for fabric softener to pick up I don't want to see third party shipping options... Serious fail.
4176,42580,Lori Hartsell,15/09/2021,Walmart,The new app is awful I have used Walmart for years but Iâ€™m going to Amazon now. I searched the shoes I like and used ones came up as an option??? If I want used shoes Iâ€™ll go thrifting. I hate it so confusing why change something that was so easy and efficient? Bye Walmart
4177,42581,Amber Hankins,15/09/2021,Walmart,"I refuse to go here anymore!!! They decided it was best to take away real cashiers and put in self checkout lanes every where. Iâ€™m a mother who prefers to do my shopping later at night when I donâ€™t have to bring my kids. But I find that incredibly difficult to do at least at Walmart now. I usually have a completely full cart of groceries and now since I have to usually use the self checkout I now have to unload, scan my own stuff, bag it, and then try to maneuver all my stuff into a stacked pile or place my bagged groceries on the floor until my cart is empty because I have no where to put them. On top of that I have someone that just watches me struggle with everything and watches me like Iâ€™m some thief or something. I even had something one time that didnâ€™t have a barcode label or price tag and I asked if the item could be looked up or someone could get me a price for it. The lady told me that they canâ€™t do that and that I would have to go back to where it was and bring up another one that has the price on it. I told her that this item was literally on the opposite side of the store and asked if there was anyway customer service would be able to find out since it was right by us. She said no they wouldnâ€™t know either. Needless to say I didnâ€™t buy the item. This store does not care about their customers or the service their customers receive. Itâ€™s all about the money and how much they are making. I would HIGHLY recommend people spend their money at local small businesses. Oh yeah and how could I forget that Walmart Billionaire Christy Walton is among the biggest donors to anti-Trump Republican group The Lincoln Project. The groupâ€™s website states Donald Trump and his supporters present â€œa clear and present danger to the Constitution and our Republic.â€ I would bet that those â€œsupportersâ€ that you think are a clear and present danger also support your billion dollar company."
4178,40045,Steve Trank,15/09/2022,Walmart,I want to make sure that the Walmart e-commerce team know of my dissatisfaction and frustration. I ordered from Walmart instead of Amazon because the item was $5 cheaper and would arrive earlier according to the website. Price was good but delivery is delayed!

4184,40097,Vicki Morrone,15/09/2022,Walmart,I was at walmart today and witnessed 4 black workers had surrounded one white lady at the register scanning her items they stopped her and told her she would have to scan her items at another register. She was humiliated in front of other people as if she was stealing. She hadn't finished her groceries in the cart yet so how can they try to stop her if she hadn't finished scanning items. As I saw this happening there was someone else at another register not scanning items right under their noses. I will never step foot in this store again. I felt so bad for this women. Shame on you!! If she wasn't paying for certain items you should have waited until she payed first than approached her. I will now do my shopping elsewhere. This looked very racist to me your prices are to high there anyways

4186,40274,Kim Q,15/09/2022,Walmart,"I would give Walmart NEGATIVE STARS if I could. If I never had to deal with Walmart again, I would be elated. I placed an online order. When the product was received I realized I could not use it. I initiated a return online. I received a bar code and instructions to take the item back to any store, have the bar code scanned and that I would receive a refund within 3 hours (that is the text on the return information). I sent my son to the store using gas, my son waited in line for who knows how long only to be told, the item was already in the system as returned and they could not do anything about the return. When he returned home with the products I called the store waited approx 20 minutes (the call never answered) I was disconnected. Called back waited approximately another 15 minutes, the call was answered by someone on the floor and after explaining, I was transferred to customer service. After a few minutes the call was picked up and once again I explained the situation. I was advised she was going to look into it, I was placed on hold, the lady NEVER came back to the phone and then after holding another 10 minutes or so, the phone was disconnected. I tried one more time, placed the call to one store on one phone and to the other store on another phone. After about 10 minutes the first store answered, this time it was another lady. I explained the situation again and the lady said hold on I need to transfer you to Michelle (the first lady who put me on hold and did not return). At this point in time my blood was already boiling. It took me another hour and half or more, several more calls and several more people I had to explain the situation to before I even got someone in a foreign country who could apparently hear how aggravated I was and finally did something constructive.  Customers of Walmart should not have to go through this in order to return something. Walmart is TOO big and the SERVICE is non existent. It is very unfortunate that as angry and as stressed as I am do to all of this I will most likely have to deal with Walmart again. Or maybe I will just use AMAZON (I would rather not use Amazon solely either, they are also too big) for everything and never deal with WALMART again. Yes, I think I hit that nail on the head. I hope anyone suffering this type of aggravation with Walmart will do the same. Walmart has alienated this customer once too many times."

4189,47159,Lily,16/09/2017,Walmart,"I used to love shopping on Walmart.com, especially when I received my order in just 2 days. Lately, however, their delivery service has been completely unreliable. It used to take 2 days to receive now takes 4 days or more and I order the same items consistently! Even worse, Walmart is now using a new delivery service, Lasership, and they are absolutely terrible!! Every single time my items are shipped through this company I NEVER receive my item, NEVER! When I track the order through Lasership the excuse I receive is either that the package was not receive for shipping by Walmart, even though I received a shipping confirmation from Walmart, or the package was lost in transit. Mind you, I NEVER receive notification that the package was lost. The status still shows as the package is in transit. Recently I ordered the same box of baby wipes I have ordered for over a year. Received an order confirmation, received a shipment notification for 2 day delivery. 1 week later and no package!! Call Walmart, customer service excuse, ""the item was lost in transit."" AGAIN, why wasn't I notified. They placed a replacement order and 3 days later the package was delivered HOWEVER I never received the package. So WHO was it delivered to??? I called Walmart yet again and received a credit. No apology - just ""what would you like me to do?"" What do you mean!? I would like to receive the items I pay for! This is it for me. I am NEVER ordering from Walmart again. Done!"
4190,47012,Maria Cotto,16/09/2018,Walmart,"they used to be customer first kind of place, but now they are so NOT. Do NOT buy an inflatable mattress, they will make up something how it is against the law to return per health code, the manager in Oklahoma at one of their many stores made up this story and said it to me, when the mattress was defective and all I wanted was a refund or exchange for a new one. The fact they openly lied to my face is crazy, looked it up online, many people have this same thing happen and have posted about it online, when you look up the law in Oklahoma or the USA, IT DOES NOT EXIST."
4191,46518,BeeJay,16/09/2019,Walmart,"I went to Walmart on Beach Blvd for a glucose meter battery at the jewelry counter. I ask a lady from the scan your items lane to page the jewelry personnel.  Vivian, ""stated she was at lunch and to come back at 2:00 PM."" I told the lady at the scan lane what Vivian said to me and how rude she was. I asked for a manager and I was told to go to the customer service desk.  The lady from the scan lane helped me find the battery I needed.  I asked for the manager at the front entrance. I explained to the manager how rude Vivian was and she lacked customer service.  This compliant is for Vivian, the jewelry counter manager. Vivian is a short woman with gray long hair.  Thank you."
4192,46519,Kathy Cooper,16/09/2019,Walmart,"The only reason they are even getting 2 stars is because the store manager was very helpful. I placed an order for first time ever for grocery pick up. Oooooh. Myyyyy!!!!!!! Never again. Did I say never ever again!?!?! Well first of all tried calling store because confusing billing with wrong name so called store manager. The first person at the pick up area sent me to service desk, who sent me to the manager, who sent me to an 800 number, who transferred me to who knows where and could not get my name correct. Whew! So recalled the store manager, who placed me on hold. I was on hold so long that I was sent back to bakery who told me to call back! Finally, I called back manager and dumb minion hung up on me. Called back and was left on hold for a while. In the meantime, my husband went to pick up order. What a mess. I have decided I will take my shopping elsewhere. My husband asked for the manager and cancelled the order and got the stuff himself. I will be watching for my credit for what I spent. I will never recommend anyone shopping for groceries there by app."
4193,46520,Amanda Baughman,16/09/2019,Walmart,"Last Thursday I ordered some items for in store pickup, never had an issue before then. First I get an email stating my order is delayed (how long does it take an employee to pull the items from the shelves, I mean really), then I requested cancellation on two of the items because I didnâ€™t need them anymore and was refunded for one of the two. I waited the prescribed 48 hours before I contacted customer service about them taking too much money and made it a point to tell them I did pickup the items providing time and date. The store showed the second item I didnâ€™t need was canceled so I need my money back.  The rep I spoke with apologized for the inconvenience, stated a system update threw everything out of whack and said she processed the cancellation and issued me a refund on the last item. Problem is I still donâ€™t have it. I wonâ€™t be using online ever again Iâ€™ll just go to the store and get what I need. Information on the website goes as far as product availability is less than honest anyway."
4194,44541,Walmart Customer,16/09/2020,Walmart,"Walmart always says ""we will do better"" ""we will update"" we will do this/that"" but they are all just talk...  The website looks like a sixth-grader designed and made it..."
4195,44542,Shelley Stapleton,16/09/2020,Walmart,"I decided to finally try the food delivery since the pick up times were gone for the day. NEVER AGAIN! They gave me an entire pound of rotten strawberries, old dirty lettuce with bugs in it and expired frozen chicken nuggets. The high quality paper towels I ordered, they gave me the cheap 50 cent paper towels. Who knows what else I'm gonna find as the week goes by and it's too late to complain"
4196,44543,mommyhead,16/09/2020,Walmart,"For the most part, I like Walmart. I like that you can go and get just about anything from hardware to underwear and then do your grocery shopping in one trip. I am an at risk senior so I also like that they've set aside an hour in the morning one day a week for me to shop with less customers in the store. That said, I wish they would follow their own rules. They have arrows marking the directions you should go up and down the aisle to eliminate cross traffic. But I see the Walmart shoppers misusing this all the time. Also, masks are required, but I see Walmart employees either not wearing them or wearing them incorrectly. Last Tuesday one was wearing a silk super thin one layer scarf/kerchief thing and it was just draped up over her face sort of but the sides were open. Like why bother? Not a mask in any way, shape or form. And even at that, she would pull it down to talk to another employee not standing even close to 6 feet apart. I have also seen outside vendors abusing the mask policy, too. And lastly, seems like the senior shopping hour is getting a bit lax, too. The outside single line barriers are all but down. I see people who are either not seniors, or who have very good plastic surgeons or botox or something. And it's not just me or just my store. My daughter-in-law shops at a different Walmart on the other side of town and she's noticed the same abuse of policy. It's one thing to see customers not following the rules, but when it's your own employees, the effort to tout yourselves as an organization who cares and wants to keep everyone safe turns into just more of the same hype."
4197,44544,Tim,16/09/2020,Walmart,"Bought an item on their marketplace. It arrived damaged. It lists the item can be returned in store on the site. NOTHING indicates that you have to contact Walmart to contact the seller and wait 48 hours for their response. After following this procedure I did not receive a followup email. Contacting them through chat the rep indicated the previous rep had not followed through and they expect me to allow them to waste another 48 hours of my time. I've been waiting for a supervisor for over 45 minutes. I will be making a sign for my cork board, ""NEVER BUY ANYTHING THROUGH WALMART.COM!"""

4199,44604,Ann Marie,16/09/2020,Walmart,"I love Walmart.com and grocery pick up! All of the reviews I am reading on this website doesn't describe my experiences with Walmart grocery, or .com.  I have had a short delay and maybe a crushed product/package from Walmart.com, but that is to be expected occasionally! Consumers don't realize that their package is not coming directly from Walmart, IT LITERALLY GOES THROUGH SEVERAL SHIPPING PROCESSES, in warehouses, on trucks, etc. So a lot can happen between Walmart shipping out your items and once it reaches your residence.  Walmart has ALWAYS helped replace the item or refund my money and sometimes even let me keep the item that was damaged so that I don't have to bother with returning it to the store. They also give the option of returning it to the store in person or through mail, they'll send you a shipping label.  Walmart grocery is the best I've ever used! For items that are out of stock, my substitutions are almost always something I'd choose, I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes (always less than) at pick up to get my groceries, the employees are always nice and knowledgeable, and my groceries are usually ready before my scheduled time slot!  I recommend Walmart website to all my friends and family because I have had many more positive experiences than negative! I highly recommend calling customer service if you have ANY problems because they have always solved my problem to my satisfaction."
4200,42544,Heidi,16/09/2021,Walmart,"The recent app changes are awful for a family only wanting to order weekly groceries. After two years of ordering our groceries through the WALMART Grocery app (and bragging to friends not in the know about how awesome it was), all the user-friendly ""grocery"" features are now gone. We'll be switching to Meijers. What was Walmart thinking???"
4201,42545,Tom Dooley,16/09/2021,Walmart,The new app is beyond horrible. Combining the grocery online experience with shopping on Walmart.com is just plain stupid.

4202,42546,Cynthia Lee,16/09/2021,Walmart,They have ruined both the online version and the app. It's no longer the easier option so I will be shopping elsewhere.

4204,42548,G Price,16/09/2021,Walmart,They have changed the format. Now grocery shopping is locked in with online to be shipped. I am having a hard time even wanting to ever order grocery pick up again from walmart after this. I am considering cancelling my entire order and going to another store. It is totally worthless and horribly confusing. It is just not worth my time to deal with such nonsense.

I can no longer scan a barcode to add an item to my list (if I can, I havenâ€™t figured out the new way yet), and finding where to scan my receipt is ridiculous! Such a disastrous disappointment."

4209,42554,Danah,16/09/2021,Walmart,The new website is very confusing. I don't like it at all. I just want to be able to go in and choose grocery pickup and select my items and pickup time. It used to be so simple and now it's a confusing mess. I don't want to shop from the Walmart website and the grocery pickup at the same time. I only want to view the items I can get at the store I am shopping at.
4210,42555,Kathy Mullins Randall,16/09/2021,Walmart,The new app is terrible. The pop out items is terrible. Being direct to website to look at list is terrible. Having grocery pickup combined is terrible. Canâ€™t see availability of item in my store or other store in area. Saved for later list deleted. Canâ€™t look up price and see if site to store is available hard to add items to list. The app is hard to navigate and just too much. The old app was better and simple. I will just go to the store or order online elsewhere until they fix the app.
4211,42557,CM T,16/09/2021,Walmart,"New website is terrible. If I want to check the inventory at the local store for an item, I have to choose a filter in a drop down menu for each and every search. What a mess by combining the online and the local store in one search. The old site was much user friendlier and easier to find products. Also getting a verification error almost every visit for some reason where I have to press and hold a button on the screen, site is almost unusable. What a big step backwards."
4212,42558,Andrew Foster,16/09/2021,Walmart,"What an absolute travesty the new Walmart website is! Products for pick up, delivery and shipping are all mixed together. There are filters, but you can't save them so you have to reapply them - for every single search! The help is useless. If you search for filters (because you can't understand why you have to set them for every single search) there are zero results. Other searches for help result in error messages and blank pages. Pricing is a mess - 6 bottles of juice for over $70 dollars? That's more than $10 a bottle and there is ludicrous pricing like that scattered across the site. Items that are ordered disappear from the order. Whoever approved rolling out this site needs to be fired!"

Regardless if she was on duty or not, she openly did her shopping while wearing her uniform even going to the lengths of having a fellow employee with a price gun. Utter disrespect for customers! Her cart was loaded full including the bottom. This truly is disgusting! On duty or off... Take your damn smock off and don't use your works tools to help you shop! Hopefully she can feel ashamed in what she did. Someone on a budget could have bought their own child a marked down toy but instead that greedy hog got them all!"
4227,40107,Frank,16/09/2022,Walmart,Worst experience I have ever went through today! I submitted a online grocery order this morning supposed to be delivered between 2-3 pm. Got a notification around 3:30 saying it was delayed. So i called they said my order left the store at 3:29pm. Finally showed up at 5 pm. I ordered 118.00 of food. I'm missing 10 items out of 31 items and was still charged for everything. The guy that delivered was shady as fu**. So I make small talk asking if they was busy he says he had a long drive you dumbass Walmart is a 5 minute drive from my house. So after i take the bags I look around and don't see anything like I know there has to be more sh**. He said oh i have the eggs in the back seat. So i go to walk with him and this idiot blocked me off. I HATE WALMART. LIKE WHERE DO THEY FIND THESE EMPLOYEES. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. PLEASE FIRE EVERYONE AND HIRE NEW PEOPLE. and one more thing 9 out of 10 your groceries is not coming from where it says it is. SO MY ADVICE JUST STOP DELIVERING

4229,47011,The Circle,17/09/2018,Walmart,"Purchased a 4k TV January 18th of 2018 along with the protection plan. Seven months later I need to use that plan due to a power surge, but it's NEVER that simple with Walmart punkass. I have had very little progress with the company because I don't have the original receipt. ðŸ˜¡ In 2018 there are a plethora of ways to verify my purchase within your facility, everyone acts as if they cannot reprint my receipt or find it even though it was through a debit card transaction which can be electronically traced. Long story short almost a month has gone by I have heard nothing about using my protection plan I'm warning everybody now do not purchase it!! Stay away from horrible customer service like this, we work too hard to throw our money away. Walmart has stolen my money, I've paid for a service I never even received."

So it ended up costing me $18 instead. What the hell kind of rip off scam is that? Never going to use my card at Walmart ever again because of this. Screw you Walmart. stupid asses deserve to get sued for stuff like this. Bunch of lame faggots, I hate every single Walmart employee"
4232,46516,Kim Stewart,17/09/2019,Walmart,"Why did the Walmart in Battle Creek MI change most of their lanes to self serve? That is such an impersonable move not to mention I am doing the job that a checker should be doing. Does this mean your prices are going to drop since you don't have to pay an employee or are you going to pay me for working at your store while I am checking myself out. What a crap move Walmart, I'm taking my business to Meijer where I can have a person to interact with instead of some hard cold metal. SHAME ON YOU!!"

4234,44538,Gee Coles,17/09/2020,Walmart,"Worst Online Store ever!!! They DONT protect their customers! Twas my first time to purchase online from walmart. After i received their official receipt email, I tracked my package and says item not found. when I called Walmart Customer Service, the rep told me that he cant tract my package either. he firther instruct me to contact directly the seller. But when I explained to him that the official receipt email i received from walmart doesnt give me an option to contact the seller directly, he told me ""you bought something from a 3rd party through walmart, I cannot help you with that but I can report your issue to my manager and you have to wait for 24hrs for our email."" 24hrs became 50hrs & so on but still havent heard anything from walmart, package still untrackable & definetely hasnt arrived ðŸ’” I was SCAMMED! SHAME ON YOU FOR STEALING PEOPLES MONEY! walmart.ca posts products on their website & it says 3rd party seller, I was expecting that It was a safe purchase because it was a 3rd party seller through walmart but I was wrong. so please all beware! DONT BUY FROM WALMART ONLINE STORE!"
4235,44539,Gerald Furry,17/09/2020,Walmart,"I was at walmart earlier and received some ver bad service there was a woman in front of me and we all were doing the social distance mess. There wa stwo women in front of the woman in front of me. As the second woman was paying for her stuff the employee let the woman in front of me start putting here items on the belt. Ok once her items which were few had moved up to where the clerk was and there was still 6 to 7 feet between us, I started putting my few items on the counter, oh the clerk informed me quick to stay back and not put my items on the counter yet. The woman in front of me was paying for her stuff while the clerk bagged the items, so I stepped to the counter again still 6 ft way and mroe, and the damn clerk told me again to step back, by this time the woman in front of me had paid for her stuff and got the bags and she was on the other end of the aisle where the round table is, I then stepped for ward a third time and the clerk told me again to step back. This was ignorant insanity to the limit. I turned around and went to the self check out area and was in and gone in under 5 minutes. I will never try to support the the few employees again by going to the manned isles and will instead use from here on out the self checkout line."
4236,44540,Rose,17/09/2020,Walmart,"I have had very good experiences shopping with WalMart online. Occasionally I have items sent directly to friends and family as gifts. Sometimes I have items delivered to my home. Most often, I place an order online and pick it up at our local WalMart store. I have learned to carefully read the details about who is selling the item on WalMart.com. Many times it is a third party seller and an item is not eligible for return or exchange through WalMart. I have found several excellent bargains online (over WalMart's regular in-store low prices.)"
4237,42531,Frankie,17/09/2021,Walmart,I just found out that Walmart donates food 4 the elderly ok. I will never critize them again ok. They r great. I do still have issues about the store performance inside but. They help alot of the elderly and that's ok by me.PS be kind 2 the people around and don't fight it doesn't do us any good we all need 2 get along ok in this bio diverse world of ours.

4239,42533,Advance PT,17/09/2021,Walmart,I used to order every week from walmart.com but no more! I DONT LIKE the new website atall. Its SO HARD to browse and find STUFF! I understand at the end of the day ITS ALL ABOUT MONEY! But why copy Amazon? You guys made it a marketplace allows 3rd party to sell and now its hard to find out which seller I am buying from and the return policy. Not to mention GROCERY PICKUP is so hard to use! You guys messed up big time! I am no longer going to use walmart.com anymore. Taking my business somewhere else. This new website is NOT USER FRIENDLY atall. Good Luck!
4240,42534,Marty Masters,17/09/2021,Walmart,Absolutely hate the new website. I did all my grocery shopping online with Wal-mart and the new site is impossible to use.
4241,42535,Christella Moore,17/09/2021,Walmart,"Walmart.com sucks. Walmart grocery pickup delivery USED TO BE great I recommended it to everybody but lately its been absolutely awful. Deliveries are always wrong if they arrive at all. AND THE ONLY FEEDBACK THE LOCAL STORE CAN GIVE IS ""CALL 1-800-WALMART. It really sucks because that hasn't solve any problems for me yet. They're unreliable and have unacceptably horrible customer service"
4242,42536,Racquel,17/09/2021,Walmart,"The new Walmart app no longer allows me to scan the item and see the correct price in my local store. If I scan a Clearanced item, the app tells me the full price. This new app is inaccurate and no longer helpful. The old app was perfect and user friendly. Incredibly disappointed."
4243,42537,Donna Wade,17/09/2021,Walmart,Walmart has changed there grocery website and it is horrible. It was so bad that after being a paid member for home delivery for almost 3 years I called to ask why 1 loaf of wonder bread was now $11.89 and 3 day delivery. When I called I was told that in fact that was the price because it was coming from the distribution center. There old system was great. Now someone that doesn't speak very good english is telling customers that Wonder bread is a special item. I don't need this type of trouble to many other stores deliver.
4244,42538,Jim Jordan,17/09/2021,Walmart,"It is impossible to just look at what is in stock at your local walmart. Even when you find something that is supposed to be there. It will change to shipping, once you go to cart."
4245,42539,KIMBERLEIGH,17/09/2021,Walmart,"Walmart advertises items they do not even have available online. I learned the hard way. When I ordered from them, they gave me a delivery date that was not met, and put a ""delayed"" status on my order. I needed the item for a birthday gift. Their customer service is a joke. Nobody knows anything and all they say is sorry for your luck and to wait for further info. They suck."
4246,42540,Dorie Glory,17/09/2021,Walmart,This new Walmart app is a piece of crap whoever decided to do this was definitely on something!! I use to do an order at least 3 to 4 days a week so the ppl could make a little more money now I canâ€™t navigate this stupid stuff!!! Ughâ€¦. You lost one loyal customer not to mention I did hundred dollars order on the clothing app once a month!! Your Loss have fun with your new stupid app!! It sucks!!
4247,42541,Valerie Comp,17/09/2021,Walmart,New app is very difficult . I used to love the online shopping for curbside pickup. Now I'll just shop elsewhere ðŸ˜©
4248,42542,L Platt,17/09/2021,Walmart,The new app changes are horrible. What was once an easy experience is now a big hassle!

4249,42543,Kevin,17/09/2021,Walmart,"The new app design ðŸ‘Ž. And the delivery service is just plain terrible.

4259,40100,Ingrid,17/09/2022,Walmart,"I ordered bedding from Walmart (Three Duvet covers: one green King size and two blue colored double size) They claim these were delivered. However, ONLY the green King size was- not the 2 double size ones. Walmart is not being helpful one bit and claim the company received a signature. There was no signature request for the package that we did receive (the Green one) so how can they have ANY signature? They claim the signature the company has is ""S Smith"" NOBODY we know- they get a signature but throw the package on the driveway? (green one only!!) This is kriminal at this point claiming there is a signature for delivery. It has been a frustrating experience with the company that supposedly shipped it and WALMART. I placed my order via Walmart so I hold them responsible for my order! I am going to close my account as soon as I pay the other items. They don't care, and are of no help!!

What came, on the correct date, was a package that looked like it had been wrapped by a small child, with the incorrect toothbrush. I went to my local Walmart and had to wait in line for about 20 minutes for customer service to tell me that their label machine was not working and that I needed to go to another Walmart. I drove to a further town and waited 25 minutes in line for a customer service person to help me.... while in a pandemic. Will not order from Walmart again. What a hassle!!!!!"
4266,44535,jen,18/09/2020,Walmart,"Their online shopping is pathetic. I ordered 2 25lb weight plates on July 21. Ship date was months later on 8/31, to arrive 9/17. The only shipment progress states ""label created"" and ready for UPS. When my item still doesn't show any shipment progress on the 17th, I check with customer service. They claim the item was ""lost"" during shipment. First of all, how the heck do you lose 2 25lb weight plates? Secondly, it was never in the UPS system. Sounds like lies to cover up what really happened. Definitely not shopping at Walmart either in store or online. The entire time (from July to September), I could have ordered from another merchant who is honest and won't take months to ship an item."

The delivery status still says delayed and it should have been delivered on the 15th! So disappointed at this as I can't seem to find items I want in store. Sorry but after I get my items I'm not ordering again, it shouldn't take 7 days to get items that have been clearly marked for 2 day delivery. Not to mention you can easily send me e-mail detailing whats going on! I can't even return these items either, Walmart your giving me the run around and I don't appreciate that. I would give zero stars but I can't write a review with it. Order at your own risk people."

Where do they get these dummies that think they know it all. The fix they tried is sick, sad, awful, terrible, lousy, for rotten, sucks, stinks, changed by a no brain jerk and did a job that they should have hired a 7 year old to do, as I'm sure they could have done better. I could go on and on, but are they listening, I doubt it although time will tell, or maybe after Walmart Pick goes down the tubes in favor of the competition. Sad!!!!"

I placed my weekly order and when I went to check out, it said that one item (a box of pudding) was available at the same location my order was coming from, but I had to go pick it up??? What? Then, it says one of my items would be shipped and I would receive it by Monday. Then, when I got my notice about substitutions, it says ""good news, 8 items were available from your store and will be delivered."" They were always supposed to be delivered. What a mess. You've made it so hard to order, and I hope you change it back."

4273,42344,Peggy Kunz Martin,18/09/2021,Walmart,"If I could give a 0 I would.... I am so disappointed in Walmart. I have been having my groceries delivered by them for almost a year with the only problem being squashed bread and broken eggs. Well today I was suppose to receive and order. The incompent delivery person sent me a text message to let him in my complex. I explained to him how to get in. The next thing I know I get a cancelation notice from the store saying there was a problem with my delivery. YES THERE WAS, THEIR DRIVER WAS INCOMPETENT!!!!!! And now they want me to reorder and can't get my groceries until later tonight. Why do they expect me to be the one to suffer because they screwed up. I AM FURIOUS AND WILL NEVER ORDER FROM WALMART AGAIN. AND TO WHOEVER ANSWER THESE WITH I'M SO SORRY YOU HAD TO GO THRU THIS, DON'T, BECAUSE IT'S NOTHING BUT A LIE. There is always a way to fix things that are satisfactory to the client but they only wanted to do it their way. I AM THE CUSTOMER AND I DESERVED TO BE SERVED THE WAY I WAS SUPPOSE TO BE. A LITTLE HINT TO MANAGEMENT: HIRE BETTER DRIVERS...SMARTER DRIVERS...THAT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO..."
4274,42345,Sherry,18/09/2021,Walmart,"Why has Walmart ruined the ease and efficiency of grocery shopping? I click on my app to buy GROCERIES and the first thing I see is celebrating Hispanic founders. While the mural is very pretty and the painter very talented I don't want to be inundated with diversity first thing when I just want to do my GROCERY shopping. It may be your company's mission NOW to be involved with all kinds of social issues but Iâ€™m sure Walt just wanted to sell good products at good prices and that's all I want from my primary GROCERY store. The next thing I see is telling me how to â€˜Set the Table for Fallâ€™. I donâ€™t want decor advice when shopping for GROCERIES. When I SHOP FOR GROCERIES I have absolutely no interest in stocking up for college. Then I see a message for 'Free Assembly'. I don't need any of my GROCERIES assembled. Then there is your Home lookbook: fall edition. Again, I JUST WANT TO BUY GROCERIES!!! Then there's a picture of various products to that I should learn more about. At no point does it take me TO my GROCERIES. My only option now is to 'See times'. That is the LAST step in my GROCERY SHOPPING process. My only direct options on this current page are to: -Search. -Look at my (still empty) grocery cart. -Click on my local Supercenter or my address. -See times. -Shop now. -Add all my essentials in one click. (Which is needed almost never) -View savings on my last order. (I can practically guarantee no one cares) -Reorder my essentials. (which finally lets me actually shop MY items after 10 minutes of BS telling me how much Walmart cares all the while wasting my time trying to sell me stuff I don't care about when I was only looking to purchase food for my family)  When it finally does get to the items I actually want to order it gives me the options to go to Reorder, Lists and Registries. Who the hell has a grocery registry? There is so much superfluous stuff added to an already tiny screen on a phone app. I really don't need to know I've bought something 12 times before. Or of it's available for pickup, delivery or 2 day shipping. When Iâ€™m GROCERY shopping I know itâ€™s either going to be picked up or delivered. I don't even want to see non perishable food items if they are only available for 2 day in my normal GROCERY shopping.  I could go on an on but if you really want to help your customers who have come to expect an easy efficient GROCERY shopping experience please let GROCERY shopping be its own thing.  Plus there are also glitches in this new app going back and forth between pages and often ending on something random I was not looking for or crashing all together. I cannot fathom that the huge highly profitable Walmart actually tested this new rollout of merging Groceries with home/college/clothing/electronics etc with actual average everyday consumer customers."
4275,42346,Dave Adams,18/09/2021,Walmart,The latest app and website is a terrible user experience if you just want to shop for delivery or pick up from store. Searching shows you everything including shipping. Fire every search you have to perform 3 licks to just show items for pickup or delivery. I'g give zeros stars if possible
4276,42347,Frank Castro,18/09/2021,Walmart,It is so sad that Walmart only gives you the option to rate the driver which has nothing to do with a process of ordering your items or picking the items. What a flawed system

The fix they tried is sick, sad, awful, terrible, lousy, for rotten, sucks, stinks, changed by a no brain jerk and did a job that they should have hired a 7 year old to do, as I'm sure they could have done better.

Then, it says one of my items would be shipped and I would receive it by Monday. Then, when I got my notice about substitutions, it says ""good news, 8 items were available from your store and will be delivered."" They were always supposed to be delivered. What a mess.

The next thing I know I get a cancelation notice from the store saying there was a problem with my delivery. YES THERE WAS, THEIR DRIVER WAS INCOMPETENT!!!!!!

It may be your company's mission NOW to be involved with all kinds of social issues but Iâ€™m sure Walt just wanted to sell good products at good prices and that's all I want from my primary GROCERY store. The next thing I see is telling me how to â€˜Set the Table for Fallâ€™. I donâ€™t want decor advice when shopping for GROCERIES. When I SHOP FOR GROCERIES I have absolutely no interest in stocking up for college. Then I see a message for 'Free Assembly'. I don't need any of my GROCERIES assembled. Then there is your Home lookbook: fall edition. Again, I JUST WANT TO BUY GROCERIES!!! Then there's a picture of various products to that I should learn more about. At no point does it take me TO my GROCERIES. My only option now is to 'See times'. That is the LAST step in my GROCERY SHOPPING process. My only direct options on this current page are to: -Search. -Look at my (still empty) grocery cart. -Click on my local Supercenter or my address. -See times. -Shop now. -Add all my essentials in one click. (Which is needed almost never) -View savings on my last order. (I can practically guarantee no one cares) -Reorder my essentials. (which finally lets me actually shop MY items after 10 minutes of BS telling me how much Walmart cares all the while wasting my time trying to sell me stuff I don't care about when I was only looking to purchase food for my family)  When it finally does get to the items I actually want to order it gives me the options to go to Reorder, Lists and Registries. Who the hell has a grocery registry? There is so much superfluous stuff added to an already tiny screen on a phone app. I really don't need to know I've bought something 12 times before. Or of it's available for pickup, delivery or 2 day shipping. When Iâ€™m GROCERY shopping I know itâ€™s either going to be picked up or delivered. I don't even want to see non perishable food items if they are only available for 2 day in my normal GROCERY shopping.  I could go on an on but if you really want to help your customers who have come to expect an easy efficient GROCERY shopping experience please let GROCERY shopping be its own thing.  Plus there are also glitches in this new app going back and forth between pages and often ending on something random I was not looking for or crashing all together. I cannot fathom that the huge highly profitable Walmart actually tested this new rollout of merging Groceries with home/college/clothing/electronics etc with actual average everyday consumer customers."
4284,42360,Dave Adams,18/09/2021,Walmart,The latest app and website is a terrible user experience if you just want to shop for delivery or pick up from store.

(which finally lets me actually shop MY items after 10 minutes of BS telling me how much Walmart cares all the while wasting my time trying to sell me stuff I don't care about when I was only looking to purchase food for my family)  When it finally does get to the items I actually want to order it gives me the options to go to Reorder, Lists and Registries. Who the hell has a grocery registry? There is so much superfluous stuff added to an already tiny screen on a phone app. I really don't need to know I've bought something 12 times before. Or of it's available for pickup, delivery or 2 day shipping. When Iâ€™m GROCERY shopping I know itâ€™s either going to be picked up or delivered. I don't even want to see non perishable food items if they are only available for 2 day in my normal GROCERY shopping.  I could go on an on but if you really want to help your customers who have come to expect an easy efficient GROCERY shopping experience please let GROCERY shopping be its own thing.  Plus there are also glitches in this new app going back and forth between pages and often ending on something random I was not looking for or crashing all together.

4320,42416,Dave Adams,18/09/2021,Walmart,The latest app and website is a terrible user experience if you just want to shop for delivery or pick up from store. Searching shows you everything including shipping. Fire every search you have to perform 3 licks to just show items for pickup or delivery. I'g give zeros stars if possible
4321,42417,Frank Castro,18/09/2021,Walmart,It is so sad that Walmart only gives you the option to rate the driver which has nothing to do with a process of ordering your items or picking the items. What a flawed system

Where do they get these dummies that think they know it all. The fix they tried is sick, sad, awful, terrible, lousy, for rotten, sucks, stinks, changed by a no brain jerk and did a job that they should have hired a 7 year old to do, as I'm sure they could have done better. I could go on and on, but are they listening, I doubt it although time will tell, or maybe after Walmart Pick goes down the tubes in favor of the competition. Sad!!!!"

I placed my weekly order and when I went to check out, it said that one item (a box of pudding) was available at the same location my order was coming from, but I had to go pick it up??? What? Then, it says one of my items would be shipped and I would receive it by Monday. Then, when I got my notice about substitutions, it says ""good news, 8 items were available from your store and will be delivered."" They were always supposed to be delivered. What a mess. You've made it so hard to order, and I hope you change it back."

The next thing I know I get a cancelation notice from the store saying there was a problem with my delivery. YES THERE WAS, THEIR DRIVER WAS INCOMPETENT!!!!!!

I have been having my groceries delivered by them for almost a year with the only problem being squashed bread and broken eggs. Well today I was suppose to receive and order.

The next thing I know I get a cancelation notice from the store saying there was a problem with my delivery. YES THERE WAS, THEIR DRIVER WAS INCOMPETENT!!!!!! And now they want me to reorder and can't get my groceries until later tonight. Why do they expect me to be the one to suffer because they screwed up.

4364,42485,Sherry,18/09/2021,Walmart,"Why has Walmart ruined the ease and efficiency of grocery shopping? I click on my app to buy GROCERIES and the first thing I see is celebrating Hispanic founders. While the mural is very pretty and the painter very talented I don't want to be inundated with diversity first thing when I just want to do my GROCERY shopping. It may be your company's mission NOW to be involved with all kinds of social issues but Iâ€™m sure Walt just wanted to sell good products at good prices and that's all I want from my primary GROCERY store. The next thing I see is telling me how to â€˜Set the Table for Fallâ€™. I donâ€™t want decor advice when shopping for GROCERIES. When I SHOP FOR GROCERIES I have absolutely no interest in stocking up for college. Then I see a message for 'Free Assembly'. I don't need any of my GROCERIES assembled. Then there is your Home lookbook: fall edition. Again, I JUST WANT TO BUY GROCERIES!!! Then there's a picture of various products to that I should learn more about. At no point does it take me TO my GROCERIES. My only option now is to 'See times'. That is the LAST step in my GROCERY SHOPPING process. My only direct options on this current page are to: -Search. -Look at my (still empty) grocery cart. -Click on my local Supercenter or my address. -See times. -Shop now. -Add all my essentials in one click. (Which is needed almost never) -View savings on my last order. (I can practically guarantee no one cares) -Reorder my essentials. (which finally lets me actually shop MY items after 10 minutes of BS telling me how much Walmart cares all the while wasting my time trying to sell me stuff I don't care about when I was only looking to purchase food for my family)  When it finally does get to the items I actually want to order it gives me the options to go to Reorder, Lists and Registries. Who the hell has a grocery registry? There is so much superfluous stuff added to an already tiny screen on a phone app. I really don't need to know I've bought something 12 times before. Or of it's available for pickup, delivery or 2 day shipping. When Iâ€™m GROCERY shopping I know itâ€™s either going to be picked up or delivered. I don't even want to see non perishable food items if they are only available for 2 day in my normal GROCERY shopping.  I could go on an on but if you really want to help your customers who have come to expect an easy efficient GROCERY shopping experience please let GROCERY shopping be its own thing.  Plus there are also glitches in this new app going back and forth between pages and often ending on something random I was not looking for or crashing all together. I cannot fathom that the huge highly profitable Walmart actually tested this new rollout of merging Groceries with home/college/clothing/electronics etc with actual average everyday consumer customers."
4365,42486,Dave Adams,18/09/2021,Walmart,The latest app and website is a terrible user experience if you just want to shop for delivery or pick up from store.

4366,42487,Frank Castro,18/09/2021,Walmart,It is so sad that Walmart only gives you the option to rate the driver which has nothing to do with a process of ordering your items or picking the items. What a flawed system

It's pathetic that you can have an unused product, only to be told that it can not be returned. In store policy is different from online ordering as I was told. I've ordered many items for my business online but this experience was enough for me to never shop walmart again and take my business elsewhere. Not even a store credit is absurd! Feel like I was robbed literally for their mistake of shipping the wrong item!"

There are never exta staff stalking shelves or anywhere in the store that seems to have time to stop and chat. Hire more People Walmart.... Im Sure you can afford it."
4406,44529,Alan Awad,19/09/2020,Walmart,The lowest of the low no customer service Ordered online and my orders was canceled after 5 days Could not pick up at the store associate refused to give me the items of the money or even to answer my questions Called and chatted with 7 different people from Walmart I get different story from each one and now itâ€™s 19 days and still didnâ€™t get my money back
4407,44530,Dan Smith,19/09/2020,Walmart,I used to work at Walmart Walmart paying their employees good Iâ€™ll see it when I believe it They can start out 18+ an hour And you wonâ€™t get work 40 hours a week and have to work two jobs donâ€™t believe Walmart Walmart is a joke
4408,44531,Jones Phil,19/09/2020,Walmart,"Great variety of devices to be sourced. Good quality over price ratio. Sometime difficult to found what I'm looking for, but usually can make it happen.   Reason I chose this business: Pieces I was looking for are available at reasonable price. Not urgent."
4409,44532,Chunguang Wang,19/09/2020,Walmart,"If I can give it 0, I would definitely do that. I'm moving this weekend, and because my new apartment doesn't have a microwave, so I ordered a microwave last week from Walmart.com. Walmart.com promised that the microwave will be delivered this Friday. So I'm happy I could expect to receive the microwave before I move. However, until this Thursday, the package was still not shipped from Indianna, Iâ€™m living in Seattle, only the shipping label was created. It's impossible to be delivered this Wednesday. Then I called Walmart.com this Thursday. One agent responded that I could expect to receive the microwave this Friday still, because he would reach out to the carrier for an expedition, if I don't get it, I could call them to get a refund. I waited the whole day this Friday, no delivery at all. Then I called back to Walmart.com for a refund because I'm moving this Weekend. However this time the agent told me I could only call them next Wednesday after 8:00pm for a refund because that's the Fedex delivery estimate time. I couldn't receive the package next Wednesday, let alone the estimated time is 5 days later than the original promised date by Walmart.com. Itâ€™s just a waste of time to call them twice, and I need to call them a third time for a microwave order! Will never Walmart.com, itâ€™s not worth the time and money."
4410,44533,Braxton Lathan Williams,19/09/2020,Walmart,Wow. This is a major corporation. They have literally the worst online shipping I've ever seen. I have tried with four different agents to get my order fixed that was shipped incorrectly. I still haven't gotten it fixed. I don't know if I ever will. I've only ordered from Walmart one time and they have completely screwed it up and then have dropped the ball in fixing it. They say it's fixed and it simply isn't I simply have not gotten I ordered and paid for. -Braxton
4411,42329,Phillip Martin,19/09/2021,Walmart,Worst app change ever! I canâ€™t even function with this nightmare of an app.
4412,42330,Deb,19/09/2021,Walmart,"Walmart's new app is horrible!! It took me 48 mins to order 6 items. RIDICULOUS!!! IT is very confusing, a chaotic mess!!!! That was my last order unless they fix that mess!! I'm done!!!"
4413,42331,Megan Casto,19/09/2021,Walmart,"Not user friendly at all!!! I live out of town, so I used to do a big grocery pick up once every two weeks and I would put items in my cart as I needed them. Between time I would have things shipped to my house that were not in my local Wal-Mart. Unable to do that anymore! So disappointing. Going to use Kroger grocery pick up until Wal-Mart fixes this horrible new site and app. Also, my mother and grandma can no longer use it so they switched to Kroger as well because it's much more user friendly. My grandma had things shipped instead of picked up and was so upset because she did not understand they were shipped."
4414,42332,Maria l Ayala,19/09/2021,Walmart,Walmart new app is horrible it doesnâ€™t even let you add or delete anything. I would not be buying from Walmart until they bring back the old app.
4415,42333,Donna Consiglio,19/09/2021,Walmart,I'm hoping Walmart takes notice of these reviews and does something about it. I miss the way it worked before. It is a hassle and frustrating to use now.
4416,42334,Andrea Snow,19/09/2021,Walmart,I loved the old walmart app please go back to it. I hate this app it is confusing and there is only 1 cart well I do shipping and pick up so I need 2 carts I live far away and don't get my groceries the same time I do my shipping order. I hope you corporate people listen and actually fix this I notice alot of people feel like I do. If it's not broke don't mess with it and that old app was great! Thank you
4417,42335,Cyndi,19/09/2021,Walmart,"Very disappointed and aggravated with the updated app. So much so, I gave up and placed my order with Foodlion and will continue to do so until Walmart changes either back to the way it was or something better then the current."

4419,42337,Dhas a Point,19/09/2021,Walmart,The redesigned layout of walmart website should be taken down. I am so frustrated! it used to be user friendly and efficient. If I am shopping for groceries I do not want to have to weed through marketplace sellers and ship only items. I want to see only what is available for the curbside pickup.
4420,42338,Brenda,19/09/2021,Walmart,This updated Walmart app is a disaster! Some items are being shipped that I know are on the shelves that could be delivered with my groceries. If they don't clean this mess up I'll go to Instacart for my grocery delivery. I'm adding to my review since the grocery items are updated in my online grocery order. The toothpaste is showing along with bananas as being weight adjusted. The substitutions no longer are able to be approved. What a mess! Instacart will be my grocery choice from now on. Walmart just lost another customer due to this crappy app.

I am completely appalled and thoroughly disgusted in what I saw in their meat department. The beef section, all of it has turned gray and has obviously gone bad. It needs to be thrown out not sold to customers. The ground beef, roasts, steaks all the beef half gray and brown. I know I am just one customer and not very important but I am done with Walmart.

4479,42505,Dhas a Point,19/09/2021,Walmart,The redesigned layout of walmart website should be taken down. I am so frustrated! it used to be user friendly and efficient. If I am shopping for groceries I do not want to have to weed through marketplace sellers and ship only items. I want to see only what is available for the curbside pickup.
4480,42506,Brenda,19/09/2021,Walmart,This updated Walmart app is a disaster! Some items are being shipped that I know are on the shelves that could be delivered with my groceries. If they don't clean this mess up I'll go to Instacart for my grocery delivery. I'm adding to my review since the grocery items are updated in my online grocery order. The toothpaste is showing along with bananas as being weight adjusted. The substitutions no longer are able to be approved. What a mess! Instacart will be my grocery choice from now on. Walmart just lost another customer due to this crappy app.

I am completely appalled and thoroughly disgusted in what I saw in their meat department. The beef section, all of it has turned gray and has obviously gone bad. It needs to be thrown out not sold to customers. The ground beef, roasts, steaks all the beef half gray and brown. I know I am just one customer and not very important but I am done with Walmart.

4490,46507,Dave HatesWalmart,20/09/2019,Walmart,"TERRIBLE!!! Used their service - company called Ria - and they would NOT pay my 3 employees when they attempted to claim the money. I had paid in CASH! Some lady in Pakistan told me there was a â€œgeneral security alertâ€ in their system and I would need to go back to Walmart for a refund. That was it! Never again! Ria, you and Walmart SUCK!!! Walmart employees and manager were equally useless."
4491,46508,Kurt,20/09/2019,Walmart,"Walmart Online is worthless. The lead time they gave me was over a week. 2 days after it was supposed to be here, I called, The tracking number said it had not yet left Irvine and I live on the East Coast. They told me they left the vendor a voicemail and the vendor had to email me within 24 hours and if not, I should call Walmart back. Nice pass the buck Walmart. I told them I needed it now - Walmart stated that I would have to speak to the vendor about that. Again pass the buck. Amazon has gotten worse, but not this bad."
4492,46509,Jackie Sanders,20/09/2019,Walmart,"I am greatly disappointed with my local stores. My last trip to the store I couldn't find 3 different products. Some they are no longer carrying, others they just didn't have stock. Employees filling online orders blocked aisles and were rude. I know they have a job to do, but as an in store customer I got the message that they would prefer I not be there. I picked up an item on a shelf that had a large display of like items, across the top of shelf was multiple large signs that said clearance and no not on clearance. To top it off there are 20+ check out lanes with only one that had a checker. I opted to use the self checkout against my better judgement. My first item rang up at the wrong price. Two items later it said I needed assistance, once again waiting on employee as she was helping other customers who were also having trouble, she did what ever she was supposed to do and it said no action needed. Really! Very frustrating, especially since this has become the norm. I will be doing the bulk of my shopping elsewhere in the future. Somewhere along the line Walmart has become more about the money and less about the customers. Very disappointed."
4493,46510,Alexander Wood,20/09/2019,Walmart,"literally such a terrible store. The staff are always disrespectful and unprofessional. One time as i left the store with my family (with my younger brother who repeats everything he hears), the staff were cursing like sailors off in a corner at the door and everybody could hear. completely unprofessional. It's what you'd expect from the staff there at this point, though. worst. store. ever."

Sent me the wrong order last time and now I order two pair of jeans, accidentally with the wrong size, and I can't cancel the order 5 minutes after it was placed! Makes no sense. Chatting with customer service solved nothing. I hope Amazon devours your online presence. Get a clue Walmart management."
4496,44522,David Chadwick,20/09/2020,Walmart,I come to Walmart in Cape Coral Delprado to shop itâ€™s a total disaster and not pleasurable feeling At the store they having 40+ self checkouts you try to check out with fresh vegetables fruit anything from the produce department and itâ€™s a total disaster you scan the item you weigh it and then it wants you to enter a number it is not a pleasure shopping here I donâ€™t understand the self check out it is horrible you have a checkout person thatâ€™s leaning against the cash register not paying attention for you guys to say youâ€™re good customer service you need to reevaluate yourself because this is the worst experience Iâ€™ve ever had I am fed up with coming to Walmart to try to shop
4497,44523,RS,20/09/2020,Walmart,"Walmart (SuperStore) - Rinehart Road, Sanford, FL  To help improve service I wanted to give you feedback on my recent pickup experience for this order detailed below. Fast it was not, convenient I am also afraid not, and to top it off despite waiting over 30mins when the order was presented it was wrong.  To give some further details, when I arrived, I called the number I was requested to do. It took the Walmart associated (Alyssa) almost 20mins to respond and when she did it was the wrong order. She was not apologetic in any form for either her tardy responsiveness or the fact that the order was wrong. So, fast it was not. The associate went back inside without any communication of the purpose and did not return. I called the number a second time in order to receive the goods I ordered and paid of. The associated eventually return but this time only provided me with 1 item of the 4 I ordered. So in reality I only received 25% or the order and requesting formally a refund for the other 75% or for the order to be fulfilled as originally requested. Convenient, not even close, hassle would be closer to the actual experience.  For your information one of their direct competitors, Target, I have done curbside picked numerous times in the last 6 months. They make curbside pick-up extremely convenient, the staff are pleasant, highly responsive, and arrive at the car almost as soon as you get there (highly organized and efficient). Orders are completed in full almost 100% of the time and when they canâ€™t, for whatever reason, they are prompt with their action, communication, and refund to remediate. That was not the experience with Walmart."
4498,44524,customer,20/09/2020,Walmart,"At the Boerne Texas store i always have a good experience. During COVID I started shopping here as HEB was a mess. They are always friendly, have lots of room in the store and have everything I need. Thanks Boerne Walmart, you are doing great work!"

4501,44527,Quanna Williams,20/09/2020,Walmart,Donâ€™t shop from walmart.com Some one from Walmart used my debit card And yes it had to be in employee Never been in a Walmart store in my life only shopped online you have your employees stealing from your customers
4502,44528,Hillary,20/09/2020,Walmart,I typically order from Walmart and have it delivered to my house. The prices are better in many cases compared to Amazon and faster delivery. The challenge began this week when I accidentally selected pick up at the store versus having the products delivered to my house. I decided that I would just go pick up the items and get a few other things while I was at the store. The cashier did not know where to pick up the items and when I went to the tower for pick up of material there were people already waiting and indicated they been waiting there for more than 15 minutes. I was able to locate a store manager after talking to a number of employees that did not seem to know how to operate the kiosk or were able to facilitate with order pick ups. After another 15 minutes we were able to get some help by an employee who started to distribute material to those waiting for pick up. The couple that have been there on my arrival received a curtain rod that was bent and was told just to go pick another one out of the store and the second customer was told that the Ramen noodles on or whatever werenâ€™t there because they were stocked out; I explained I had just seen an entire aisle of the same product. Clearly There is a disconnect between the online delivery to house versus pick up services. The stores are not equipped to support the pick up model. Walmart needs to either drop this service or amp it up to people and or exceed the director home shipping experience.
4503,42318,Mishel Qween,20/09/2021,Walmart,"Walmart.com is a bunch of CROOKS. They hurboring 3d party Sellers,like ""ProSeller"" who sells junk and charge high prices for garbage.And they dont want to honor their return policy. When I want returning unwanted and unusable merchandise, they deactivated my account. They simply screw me. I have never seen anything like this before.AWOID THIS COMPANY!!!!"
4504,42319,S Graham,20/09/2021,Walmart,This company is terrible. I would suggest buying products anywhere else when possible. Support small business by buying direct from your favorite brands.
4505,42320,cammy radosevich,20/09/2021,Walmart,"Nightmare! We now live well over an hour from a Walmart so I use the shipping for household goods. The new site is unavigable. Also, the prices have increased dramatically for the shipped products as opposed to in store or pick up. I also can't get items shipped that I have been getting shipped for over a year every two weeks on pay day. What the heck WALMART!!!! I will now only be doing pick up orders for Kroger (which has digital coupons) and Aldi and Lidl until you work this out!"
4506,42321,Tiffany Kirby,20/09/2021,Walmart,"I don't even want to give them one star. I've never been a fan of Walmart because they're merchandise is crap and their service is even worse. But my husband decided to buy me a laptop online through Walmart. It just came in not only was it the wrong laptop and even worse a used one they didn't even send the right charger for the wrong laptop. He also ordered two rokus that were in stock then they canceled the order the next day saying they refunded the money. here it is a week later and no refund. And they continue to make excuses for it. Just a warning, stay away from Walmart online ordering and if your smart you won't shop at Walmart at all. Totally disgusted"
4507,42322,Clarkb Kent,20/09/2021,Walmart,"Walmart.com and Third-Party Vendor JoyBuy Express is my worst experience with online shopping. No Customer support from Walmart nor the loser third-party vendor JoyBuyExpress. JoyBuyExpress list items for sale on Walmart.com that they don't have and subsequently ships cheaper items which are worthless. I do not recommend Walmart.com and Especially the Vendor ""JoyBuyExpress""."
4508,42323,John Wood,20/09/2021,Walmart,"Walmart.com is the worst buying experience I've ever had. Once they have your money they refuse to help you find your package that is already a week in delay. Not because the product was out of stock but because they use a secondary retail source called Spreetail. That place gets paid and lets your package sit in some warehouse for a courier service named Lasership. That courier is unwilling to help you. If you try contact them you will be on hold for at least 30 minutes only to be told there's nothing they can do. If try to cancel your order, Walmart, Spreetail, and Lasership all say the same thing, ""it's not possible to cancel your order at this time "". This has been a nightmare experience and I will NEVER use Walmart.com again!!"
4509,42324,Sandra Taylor,20/09/2021,Walmart,"New walmart update sucks.Now everything is mashed together no separate walmart online,walmart grocery.Items not scanning in store showing out of stock and not scanning clearance prices.Thats when I could actually get it to load past the cartoon lady tapping her phone.Now it just freezes and does nothing.Bring back the old Walmart app!!!Ordering groceries online for in store pick up now instead of canceling items or substitution it ships them.I don't want to wait for groceries to ship for in store pickup.Id rather they be canceled and go buy somewhere else in store or substituted.Half the time it don't load past the cartoon lady tapping phone so I can't use the $98 year subscription I paid for Walmart+ just started it last August month"
4510,42325,Melanie,20/09/2021,Walmart,Terrible change to the website and app. Too hard to figure out the difference between grocery pickup vs items I want to have delivered. Will stop grocery pickup if they don't change it back since it's too confusing to try ordering groceries now.
4511,42326,Lu Shafer,20/09/2021,Walmart,"The old app had things separated nicely, this new app complicates things, I want to see what Iâ€™m purchasing now, not what can be shipped to me if itâ€™s not in stock! I will be shopping elsewhere!"
4512,42327,Amy,20/09/2021,Walmart,"I have to click pick-up as a filter with every single item search, make sure you dont type-o because you will have to again click pick-up as a filter. some items state pick-up or delivery but get placed in delivery anyways and will be shipped weeks later when its in the store sitting on the shelf and could be placed in my pick-up order. couldn't find specific items even when the brand name and description is typed in search but find it available to order in the ""forgot any items"" page during checkout. Cant find previously bought items listed or shown first, have to re navigate old orders to check previously bought items, my lists contain stuff ive bought from walmart.com mixed with store items which is not helpful. I hate this new website app"
4513,42328,Melanie Hitch,20/09/2021,Walmart,"Why would you change your app, you already took away Walmart rewards. Plus you donâ€™t have sales and everything is cheaper at Aldis and target. Only reason I paid extra on items was for the Convenience."

I was wanting to speak to a Manager and he would not transfer me. He talked over my voice and did not allow me to speak. I am 52 years old. No one treats or speaks to me in that manner. Please pull the call.. It was around 11:30am. I stopped shopping at Walmart due to the unprofessional people that work there. I will be going back to Kroger. JEREMY has no clue what CUSTOMER SERVICE IS. Horrible experience!
4518,46506,Richard Smith,21/09/2019,Walmart,"What a joke.. Product arrived in completely broken box and order was incomplete. The best part!!

I called to return so I can get my bed. Just to hear that I can return for a refund, but the reorder is up to me. I told the guy it will be the last time I order from .com as this is the 3rd time they have screwed up my order. If they don't make this right, I will be removing this from my order list."
4521,44519,Cait,21/09/2020,Walmart,"While working at Walmart In the past it was horrible. Everyday there was not enough staff,the management did not do theyâ€™re job properly when it came to scheduling for each position. When working at Walmart you never moved your position. No one helps out, the management says they will help but donâ€™t. The hours are terrible and when I worked theyâ€™re as an employee I was used more then others and was never thanked for my work even when being by myself In a position."
4522,44520,Kerry C,21/09/2020,Walmart,"Last time I will use Wal-Mart's website. They cannot, apparently, resolve the issues of delivering on time. Given so many chances, I once again had a guaranteed delivery day and, nope, it's not happening. Covid is no longer an excuse, as most other websites are back on track for months. Done with this organization, that wants you in their stores, not online. That's one way you get the virus, by visiting money grubbing places like Wal-Mart. I stopped physically shopping there years ago because of bad, rude, employees. They never fixed that either!"
4523,36179,QwertyJB,21/09/2018,Amazon Go,Cool for the experience - food overpriced Quick and easy and a little bewildering.  Food offerings are good and plentiful.  Dangerously easy to spend and very quick to do so!

4525,42315,Gina,21/09/2021,Walmart,"Why am I redirected to a SEPARATE webpage outside of the app to build lists?? I canâ€™t even figure out how to add items to the lists anymore anyway. Same for managing your account, Iâ€™m redirected to open a webpage. Whatâ€™s the point of even having the app then?!?! Also, after searching for an item, changing between Walmart locations is a hassle. The old app used to let you filter out locations to see what store had what. It also had a map so you could see where to find the items in the store. It says a lot of things are out of stock when they are not, and Walmart Pay used to be on the homepage. Now you have to click around to find it. Walmart, whatever exec said this was a good idea is TOTALLY out of touch with its customers. I deleted the app and will only be shopping at Kroger from now on. GOODBYE."
4526,42316,Alisa Madden,21/09/2021,Walmart,"If we could leave a review that will s less than 1 I would. You say you can provide all our needs, but you have not been able To provide any of our needs for over a year. I will find other people and services to provide those needs, but please quit telling lies to the public. You have given me several reward dollars but it does no good if we canâ€™t use it. You have the worst customer service and the worst pickup and delivery service that has never been provided in our area and I live less than 10 miles from your store. You rate less than a 1 but that was the lowest rating I could give. Well me like many others in the area will find better service elsewhere!!!!!!!!!!"
4527,42317,Cosmic Liar,21/09/2021,Walmart,"I have no words for how they treat their workers, it's absolutely disgusting. My local Walmart doesn't even support some essential needs as simple as milk, fruits, vegetables and more."
4528,47004,Mary Jane West,22/09/2018,Walmart,"I am rating Walmart only two stars because of Corporate Greed.  There are a few things I know about them that some people do not know.  For example: In the beginning of the corporation, Sam Walton was very good to his employees. He gave a straight ten percent discount to all of his employees. After he died, in come the corporate executives who have a go ahead to do just anything they want to make the stores even more profitable. These executives could not care less about the employees working there and keeping the company together. Almost immediately, only certain things bought by employees at Walmart have the discount. What doesn't have a discount anymore? Basic needs that everyone buys. Groceries, mainly. What is their excuse? Obesity? No, they are just covering up by saying this. The real reason is they want a bigger paycheck.  If you have a Walmart receipt look at the right hand side. ""X"" means it qualifies for the discount. ""T"" means it has been 'terminated' from the ten percent discount. You'll find that only high ticket items, electronics, and other higher priced items are the only ones included in the employee discount.  No more Christmas bonuses for Walmart employees.  A point system. It doesn't matter if you have a legitimate excuse, you have a point system. It doesn't even matter if the reason is you have cancer. They couldn't care less about the employee that keeps the stores together. If you get too many points (tightest point system I have ever seen) You are out of a job!  The only thing that matters to them is money!  I know no one will listen to me, but will you please stop shopping at Walmart? Aldi stores have better grocery prices, trust me!!"
4529,46503,Angela Marie,22/09/2019,Walmart,"Horrible customer service. I ordered a 50â€™ JVC tv. Delivered next day. Upon opening it was completely damaged. Screen all full of cracks. I called to have it picked up. They were gonna send a replacement. I noticed I was going to be charged for it so I canceled The replacement and asked for refund. Upon calling several times. I finally had fedex pick up damaged tv. Few days later I call to find out who refund will be given and I was told I cancelled order. They are so incompetent of handing orders. I am so sick of dealing w people that do not care and keep saying sorry. They arenâ€™t sorry. They are horrible even shipping a large tv in a small ontrac van. Now Iâ€™m told it will take another week to have it delivered to distribution center in Vegas. That it says that in email. Never said anything in email how long it will take and also I could not return at local store. So beware of buying from Walmart.com. Itâ€™s not worth the frustration when itâ€™s damaged and u have to return it. They are rude, give wrong information to get you off phone."

4531,42305,Cindi Riggins,22/09/2021,Walmart,"Only reason I am giving them a 1 star is because you have to in order to write a review. Iâ€™m a disabled senior citizen that doesnâ€™t drive and I feel very defeated right now. I have had more problems than good, yet like a fool I give them the benefit of the doubt( and Iâ€™m hungry) and order food again and I donâ€™t get my delivery. I have lost count how many times I have been hopeful order 1-3 days in advance and I would say out of every 5 orders I place I might get 1. Why do they offer this service and not provide?? What is really stupid on there part is I have a neighbor that orders food often same day and time she gets her delivery but I donâ€™t get mine. Iâ€™m literally starving and they fail. Unfortunately I canâ€™t use any other store due to the fact of my pmnt options. They send me a email next day they had to cancel my order. Really no kidding!! Today my order was not even prepared yet I have a doctor appointment and I canceled order and they are blaming me. I call they donâ€™t answer. Now my funds are tied up and I canâ€™t shop until they release my food stamps. My food was supposed to be delivered 10a-11 I canceled order at 10:50 because of my doctor appointment."

After and hour of waiting I left...guess my grand daughter will not get the dress I was making for her!! There is no excuses for this kind of neglect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4536,42310,Chris Magdon,22/09/2021,Walmart,"Went to Walmart last Sunday and couldn't find half the items I wanted. Since they're closed overnight, all the pallets of merchandise are in the aisles blocking customers. The store has been reconfigured and you can't find anything. Was fine the way it was. And since the remodel, prices have gone up. Example, small bag of Walmart's own brand chips was $ .92 two weeks ago now it's $1.44. Really!!?? And checking out is horrible. All self-checkout aisles were lined up past the main front aisle. Only 4 regular checkouts were open out of 8. And no Express checkouts were open. Felt sorry for the guy in front of me. He only had 2 items and had to wait for someone with an overloaded cart to checkout. All in all, think I'm done with walmart."
4537,42311,Russell Smith,22/09/2021,Walmart,"Just tried to make a sizable order, but it got a little confusing, and more of a hassle than I wanted. Amazon and Kroger are shaming you right now. What's happened to you guys?"
4538,42312,George Warren,22/09/2021,Walmart,"Let me first express that any retailer who has a 1.4 out of 5 review rating, should be in bankruptcy! I recently order 3 different items from them online. Two hours after I ordered these items, I received an e-mail saying two of the three would be delivered that day? Nothing was received and the next day I received an e-mail stating that the delivery had been delayed. On the third day after ordering these items, one item arrived? The following (fourth day), I received an e-mail saying the remaining two items had been cancelled? No explanation as to why! I don't know who is running this circus, but they better school their clowns. I am done with them online and have avoided their stores for years and will gladly pay more elsewhere!"
4539,42313,Linda Dene,22/09/2021,Walmart,"I ordered, a crib, a mattress, 2 mattress protectors, a sheet & changing pads, every item was delivered within 2 weeks. The only item I brought back was the sheet, at the old Boynton beach location, to their return department who were fast and knowledgeable . The crib was well made & at a great price. Wallmart will be my first selection from now on, because of the price, and easy returns. L.D. Of Boynton bch"
4540,42314,Ken,22/09/2021,Walmart,Previous web site and app werenâ€™t that good but the new web site is really bad and the app is significantly worse. Canâ€™t find anything and the ads in the app are intrusive. Iâ€™d demote the fool that approved these changes.
4541,44507,Erica Johnson,23/09/2020,Walmart,"Ordered a headboard weeks ago from Walmart.com. On the original delivery date I received a notice that there was a delay. I received this message several times. Last week, they sent a tracking number saying the headboard was on its way. Today, they sent an email saying, â€œWe couldnâ€™t deliver your package for some reason and am issuing a refund.â€ I just wanted my headboard. Wonâ€™t be ordering from Walmart EVER again, they need to get their logistics together!!!"
4542,44508,None Ya,23/09/2020,Walmart,"Walmart online orders. I didn't get the option to change my shipping address (old address) on my account. It asked for billing address (new address) so I assumed it w ou old be the same as billing. WRONG, now my packages are 1.5hours away from me and I'm out $30+ because walmart customer service refused to open a claim with FedEx and FedEx said they couldn't do anything without the shipper contacting them first. So I guess someone else gets to enjoy all my products I paid for. Pretty shooty walmart service wouldn't even request FedEx to pick it up and hold it at the center."
4543,44509,Randy Keith,23/09/2020,Walmart,never ever buy any thing that is from a third party seller from walmart.com it's all ways junk and they will not give a refund or exchange.i got a blue tooth receiver for my old stereo in the garage it worked good till the battery ran down and then it would not make contact to recharge when I plugged it in.most every thing we buy now is pure junk from china. usa the great wasteland of the world can't trust none of the company's and stores no more they just Rob us for our money and don't care about the people . this is just a giant sewage plant in USA. dont you love it they do and most people here now are to ignorant to stand up and speak out about it.
4544,44510,Nicole Leee,23/09/2020,Walmart,Terrible experience ever since the whole Covid restrictions started! They weren't allowing clothing returns which no other store did! They had fewer employees working. They marked the isles with ONE way stickers wgich is highly unnecessary! Overall Terrible service and will be choosing Target.
4545,44511,Roger & Lynn Coplen,23/09/2020,Walmart,"Because we live 40-50 miles from the nearest Walmart, shopping online is a real advantage for us to have our order delivered directly to our door. However, we have ordered a favorite canned product twice now (10-20 cans) and many of the cans are dented. The most recent order of 20 had 9 dented cans. They all arrived in one box and were not padded at all. We would really like to see Walmart improve their online packaging. We are reluctant to continue to order if the products are damaged upon arrival."
4546,44512,KittyKat,23/09/2020,Walmart,They only have one register open and a long line of 10 people and refuse to open any others and then they expect you to keep social distancing. Absolutely ridiculous.
4547,44513,Evalyn Mcwilliams,23/09/2020,Walmart,Be careful about ordering from walmart.com if you need to return something you will never get your money back.most of the stuff you order dose not come from walmart. So it has to be returned to the company it came from that is the last you will see your product or refund. Has happened to me twice..one for $27 and 1 for$49
4548,44514,Josemary Negron Chardon,23/09/2020,Walmart,Worst experience ever. I made a grocery shopping online for the first time and I won't do it again. I didn't get some of my items. They told me that I was going to get a refund in 24 hours and it's been almost a week and I haven't received my refund yet. And when I'm going to check my purchase history I can't. So I can't get my money back. Walmart stealed from me!
4549,44515,Shanae Farabee,23/09/2020,Walmart,Worse experience ever with delivery they expect me to return a 50 inch tv even amazon picks up stuff this is a pandemic shame all money Walmart makes off me .Get with the times a carrier can drop off they can pick up too.

4551,44503,jeff,24/09/2020,Walmart,Walmart and I mean all walmarts must have a child putting people in management positions....i have never ever been in one no where they put the customer first and made sure their customers were put first and their employees actually tried to help the customer....i personally cant stand walmart...their ethics and their management skills are on a child's level....

4553,44505,Jennifer Masiello,24/09/2020,Walmart,"My issue was not resolved. I need someone that will be able to help me adjust my Credit card information on my current order. I am using the same card number, exp date and security code. I put the wrong name and billing address in when I placed my order. I am able to do any security verification that will be needed to update the information BUT NO ONE is willing to help me correct this! I am not able to cancel the order due to it being a pre order item and it is now out of stock! I have never experienced a worse customer service department as Walmart! How hard is it to just adjust the information without canceling the order?!?!?! To say I am disappointed is and understatement! I absolutely will never shop at Walmart again!"
4554,44506,Thomas Warren,24/09/2020,Walmart,"This new app totally sucks!! Why must I have to choose between p/up & delivery and simply shopping online? This really pisses me off! I will NEVER choose p/up and delivery you morons!! The new app text is tiny, incomplete listing of products, wrong prices and a crappy layout compared to the old nearly perfect app!! You morons did not improve one item, you only made the entire app 2and rate and very irritating to use. Uninstall NOW!!! SHOP SOMEWHERE ELSE!!"

I donâ€™t want to shop online for all of my purchases, I want to shop in my local store and want that option without being filtered to a bunch of higher prices online. Your loyal shoppers know your endgame and it is a shame that you have developed this app. Go back to the old version!! PLEASE!"
4557,42302,d ca,24/09/2021,Walmart,"terrible new website - clearly the people creating it have never grocery shopped at walmart. Moronic. Cumbersome. 1000x worse. The old grocery site was simple, intuitive and easy. Had to screw it up!"
4558,42303,Jessica Broome,24/09/2021,Walmart,This new walmart app is the worst app ever.it makes me not want to use it at all.way to hard to do what u need to do.they need to put it back how it was.they ruined a good thing and will lose online customers
4559,42304,Annie,24/09/2021,Walmart,"The ""new & improved"" website :/ The site has been rendered unusable... why Walmart? All you had to do was leave it like it was, it worked perfectly. I now use my local Food Lion for grocery pickup even though their prices are higher. Please reconsider what you've done in removing the 2 carts and destroying your website."
4560,42556,Beth,24/09/2021,Walmart,I hate your new website-itâ€™s terribly confusing-and most times it will not let me add items that say they are grocery pick up items. It puts them as shipping-even though it says they are pick up.Please go back to the way it was it was much more user friendly UPDATE: Ok week 2 of using the new website-it still has its issues but I have ordered my grocery pickup with success this week and ordered things for home delivery with success-so Iâ€™m getting use to it. I liked the old website better but Iâ€™m figuring it out because no way do I want to go inside the store. Itâ€™s chaos in there.
4561,46499,Paula Sypulski,25/09/2019,Walmart,Walmart said they were taking carseats and giving gift cards till Sept 30 then without notice they stopped it 9 days early. If they were only going to do so many then they should have said so. Very dissatisfied
4562,46500,Kim,25/09/2019,Walmart,I will be shopping amazon in future. If you have a problem with a seller Walmart won't respond.
4563,46501,Jennifer,25/09/2019,Walmart,"If I could rate Walmart as a '0', I would. I placed an order on August 22, and was told it was to arrive August 27. It is September 25 and not only have I not received my order, despite contacting the company via email, telephone, and live chat they will not refund my money! Their company simply gives the same standard reply, making me think they haven't even given my request any thought. I have since ordered and received the products from elsewhere, so it definitely isn't a supply issue. Horribly disappointed and will never again order from this company!! THINK TWICE BEFORE ORDERING FROM THEM!"
4564,46502,Britt Perry,25/09/2019,Walmart,"My 14 year old daughter purchased a monitor at Walmart.com, using two gift cards from Walmart and a few dollars from her own debit card. The monitor came without HDMI ports and no stereo capability. Anyway, we took it to the store to exchange it for something with HDMI ports; however, after waiting to talk to someone about it, they said it canâ€™t be returned in store. I asked where we can return it, and they said â€œthe marketplaceâ€. What marketplace? After about twenty minutes of waiting, they printed out a receipt that said to contact Walmart.com or contact Walmartâ€™s customer care team. Iâ€™m like, Iâ€™m standing inside Walmart?!? Isnâ€™t this a bit ridiculous to have to call Walmart customer care? Anyway, I proceeded to call their number and was transferred from a live person to an automated system, then, I proceeded to wait on hold for another twenty minutes; at the end of my hold time , I was connected with some lady from India that I couldnâ€™t understand at all! Broken English and unable to understand what I was saying to her about trying to exchange or return the item. What I could get out of her, was that their customer care had closed ten minutes ago (while we were waiting in Walmart for a printout of who to call to return the item) and I could try again tomorrow at 9:00 am to speak with someone else. I hung up the phone and told the cashier he could keep the monitor and I went to Best Buy and bought her a new one. Waste of time. Worst customer service ever."
4565,44497,Anonymous,25/09/2020,Walmart,"Walmart in Brick NJ has the worst managers, the worst cashiers, and is filthy. After work, there are only a few cashiers available and you have to wait in line for half an hour or more because the cashiers are so slow and talk too much. I cringe every time I have to go in that store which is less and less. I'd rather go some place else and pay extra to avoid that place. They definitely do not have their act together. The managers stand around talking instead of shortening the time you have to wait in line. During this pandemic, we want to get out of the store as quickly as possible and that never happens. The store is filthy, the restrooms are disgusting. Even the smell when you walk into the store makes you want to throw up. The managers in that store need to go managerial school because the way they manage a store is pathetic. It took them years to replace the light over the greeting card section, where you need a light and they couldn't even do that right. Many customers are agree Get your act together!"
4566,44498,Nigel Thomas-Tyson,25/09/2020,Walmart,this place is soooooo f**king ass. would give lower rating if i could. Let me start by saying their website is so cancer that they should just delete it and have only store interface. i went to buy a PS5 on there this morning and it was a horrible experience. first they said my order was confirmed and they would send an email and here i was so excited that i just got a pre order ps5 then i never get a confirmation email and i was confused so i call them and get met by a horrible customer service rep that couldn't even understand what i was trying to communicate and after like 5 minutes of just such unhelpful communication there is nothing that could be done and my PS5 is gone. so Walmart im super cheesed and you owe me another chance at a ps5 pre order.
4567,44499,R. Lacy,25/09/2020,Walmart,"I looked at other reviews before posting mine. People are dead on. Apparently, their shipping carrier is FedEx and they are ALWAYS delayed with no reason other than. I never get my orders within the timeframe I'm supposed to. I used to love shopping from Walmart. But now, store or otherwise, I'd rather shop Amazon. If you don't mind the undependability from Walmart shipping, or the terrible, terrible, terrible customer service in their stores then have at it."
4568,44500,Jutta Duncan,25/09/2020,Walmart,"ordered thru walmart.com. It doesn't show it, but it ended up coming form their marketplace. They sold me an item that company doesn't even stock! So I returned the item the same day. that company ended up sending me a bill of lading to return the item they had send regular mail to me, to save on shipping (the will give you some BS story, but its just plain not true). So after it finally got there 11 days later, now i'm told that i have to wait another 7-10 business days to get my money back on an item that they don't even sell. Walmart tells me : well, that's what shipper is asking so we have to provide it. 10 business days later, 25 days since item returned, i still don't have my money. Now company is saying walmart to refund. Walmart finaly , supposedly, is...but it will be another 5 business days. There is absolutely no consumer protection for customers when you order form walmart.com, don't do it....we will see after 40 days if i finally have my 300 dollars back (and oh, they dont' refund taxes either, seller refunds item, walmart refunds taxes---so who knows what i even get back)"
4569,44501,Simone Thomas,25/09/2020,Walmart,Do NOT order from Walmart.com because you will never get your packages. Iâ€™ve tried several times to order from them and itâ€™s a shot in the dark. The package is always â€œdelayedâ€.
4570,44502,T B,25/09/2020,Walmart,Thank u Walmart for not over pricing your insulin. The same insulin at CVS or Walgreens is over $100 when at Walmart itâ€™s only $25!! God bless and thank you for letting me afford my medications.

I'm stuck with a useless piece of garbage and out $200. literally 11 calls to customer service and over 6 hours of my own time spent trying to solve the issue only to be told it's my problem not theirs. on the plus side they were very curtious and friendly while they where telling me that Im basically F'ed. I'll never use walmart.com again."
4573,46498,gerard malatesta,26/09/2019,Walmart,Went in the Metairie. La. Store back in approx June bought weed block for a job I was doing never actually bought there weed block before on the label it stated 10 year warranty the products are sold by dalen products out of Knoxville Tennessee. After going to store as I told told to do to out in a complaint it was a misarable experience no one knew that that could be done in the store... Really..lol so then I was contacted by dalen products they agreed to refund my money and send me free chatge there 20 year product but not pay me anything for having to redo the garden all over again after a one and a half weeks later THE GRASS GREW BACK THROUGH TWO LAYERS IF THERE PRODUCT. Once again I contacted them and was told they did all they could do for me so I asked to moved up the ranks the supervisor sent me a dear John letter stated they done all they can do. Then I left a message for there company president no return call. So now IAM stuck redoing this clients landscaping all over again out if my pockets.So unfair. Do not buy the weed block from Walmart made by dalen products. It's toilet paper.. Dalen product are selling inferior products to the general public shame on them
4574,44493,Frank Vigil,26/09/2020,Walmart,"I have three grocery stores in my area: Smiths, Raley's and Walmart. Of these, Walmart is the ONLY store that CONSISTANTLY offers ZERO hand and/or cart sanitizers and their own staff is doing NOTHING to clean the carts. I have brought this up with store manager(S) multiple times. The best these stooges can do is shrug their shoulders. They could care less about protecting their customers."

4577,44496,Andrew John,26/09/2020,Walmart,Do NOT buy from Walmart online !!!! I ordered a WiFi router form what I thought was Walmart. They charged my CC the next day and printed a shipping label. It has now been over 3 weeks and the product still has not physically shipped. And they don't let you cancel because a shipping label was printed... It's a total scam and I expect to now be fighting to get a refund for the next few months. I don't know how this can be legal???? I should have gone to BestBuy and spent the extra $10 for the router.
4578,42297,Stephanie ewoldt,26/09/2021,Walmart,If I could give the Walmart app a 0 it would be a 0 hate the new app you removed all of the scanners from the stores forcing us to use the app which was working perfectly and now nothing scans properly. If the item is on clearance it doesn't ring up at all but say barcode not found or we found something similar. I have even rang up regular priced items just to see what it would say what it would say a rug rang up for $1262.42 When I had a cashier price check it tell me how much it really was it was 69.99 Exactly what the tag said it should be I hope that you could find a way to get this Walmart app fixed soon if not I will be shopping somewhere else
4579,42298,Crystal,26/09/2021,Walmart,"I hate the new Wal-Mart online services and ordering. I also hate the app as well. I do not like how they combined shipping and pick up for the Grocery services. When I am doing a grocery pick up order, I do not care to see what they have for shipping. I'm only interested in what they have at my store for me to pick up. They took a service that was so simple and made it complicated, in my opinion."

It's obviously not just me - this update is AWFUL and honestly I feel too frustrated to even try and place an order! It's confusing AF, I just want the old site back!  Edited to update - so I finally placed an order. I edited it numerous times, AND THE FRAUD DEPARTMENT CANCELED MY ORDER!! WTH!? I've always edited orders to add/delete items, NUMEROUS times, and have never had an issue. Now I have to wait for a new time slot. I'm just going to go to the damn store at this point. So frustrating."
4583,42611,Loyal Shopper,26/09/2021,Walmart,"Trying out delivery.... the only reason for the star is so I could type this entry.....you get no stars bells are whistles  I have no way to the store now so I thought I'd try and see how this works. My first try was 9/6/21 .  chose my grocery items checked my list went to check-out and all items went on my charge card. well, I had entered my info beforehand.  Call CS, and the guy talks over me..I had to reiterate my concerns 4 times...4 times. So I called back and got a person with a brain.  Thank God, this person was helpful. I follow all instructions to the ""T"": waiting like 1/2 hour to try again. Re-enter my order. So now I'm thinking Hey, this is it.  nonononono bLINKY no!!!!!! FIRST ORDER: ITEMS MISSING  SECOND-ORDER: 9/10/21 OK! LET'S SIGN FOR THIS thinking this will make it better. They never offered anything to sign.  NOT...the 2nd order disaster. So now I'm questioning the location. and I'm wondering are the delivery drivers honest...this driver brought 4 bags and went back to his car stood by the trunk of the car ..got in his car made a u-turn and drove away. >ALLEGEDLLY< So( DID HE ) he drive away with my items. Walmart you have got to do better. ~A LOYAL SHOPPER~  9/26/2021 need items but I am blocked from ordering......................now its time to go to the higher office....SMDH"

4585,46497,Serita,27/09/2019,Walmart,"I wasted several hours on their website attempting to purchase a gift card for a friend who specifically requested it to help with her Christmas shopping. One would think giving a store money for their own gift card would be seamless but after 6 attempts, my order kept getting cancelled because they couldn't ""verify my payment information"". I used 2 separate credits and PayPal, double-checking that all of my information was correct - still every. single. time. the order was cancelled. I contacted their customer service who told me twice the order would be ""manually verified"" so it would go through - wrong. Then I was told it was my bank's fault - by bank said wrong. Even though they are the only verified vendor of their own gift cards, attempting to purchase one is a complete waste of time."
4586,44489,Meghan Dadiego,27/09/2020,Walmart,"Worst online customer service!!! They put the prices of items in store less than the prices of the same item online. They continue to say that they can not ""price match"" items even though it is not price matching when the item is only sold online and there is no option to get it in store for that price. Point is I will not be giving them any of my money."
4587,44490,Kevin Smith,27/09/2020,Walmart,"I order an IPad from Walmart.com on 9/23/20 because they said it would arrive on 9/25/20. I only did this because of the promised arrival date. I could have driven to Best Buy and had it sooner, but Walmart said it would be here and it was earlier than the date I needed to have it by so I did it. My order went into ""preparing order, Tracking number available soon"" within an hour. When the status hadn't updated by the midday on the 24th I contacted customer service for the first time. I was told that he couldn't tell me anything and my order status should update within 24 hours. I waited until bedtime and again contacted customer service. This time I was told that there was no status update yet and no future guidance yet, my best bet was to wait and see. The morning of the 25th came and no update so again I contacted customer service. I was told that my order hadn't shipped yet and because of high demand they were delaying shipping them. What? I checked the website and they were still offering next day delivery if I ordered within the next hour! I decided to wait and see if it would update and at least be delivered soon as I needed it asap at this point. Three hours later I got an email saying that the IPad was backordered an my order would be updated or canceled when they knew something. I checked and they were still offering delivery next though. I still decided to wait and see. Later that day I decided to cancel and drive and pick one up. I canceled my order online only to be told that it would take 48 hours to process my cancelation even though they missed the delivery date and didn't have what they advertised as having in stock. It took three more attempts and an getting transfered to a manager to get a cancelation processed the same day. I can't begin to tell you how maddening this all was after dealing with great customer service and on time deliveries from competitors for years. I will never deal with Walmart again. I totally understand high demand and supply, but don't falsely advertise you can deliver something that you can't and then treat your customers like garbage when you do it."

Was lied to by an employee who said I had 7 days to pick up. The store cancelled my order 2 hours later, after I had paid with my debit card. Now it's going to be 3-5 days to refund me my money. Called Walmart to figure out what happened and both the corporate office and the management at the local store didn't seem to care. Will take my business elsewhere."

4593,46493,Kelly McDonald-Span,28/09/2019,Walmart,Ok here goes. I bought a futon bed in april that was supposed to he new. When i got it the box had been repackaged and no plastic covering on the matress itself. Didnt think much of it until a few months down the road i start seeing little brown bugs crawling on me. I had looked underneath the mattress and found a couple but not very many that I could see of but I have never dealt with bed bugs before so I really had no idea what I was dealing with. I thought they were coming from our basements or the carpet or something. They have progressively gotten worse and as of today I had an exterminator come into my home and tell me that that matress was the source of the bed bugs. He said the accumulation is the right time frame for when I got the bed and he sees it quite often when beds are resold after being returned or any factory where they are exposed to other things. I have let Walmart corporate know but they did not offer to reimburse me anything or even apologize for the situation. The only one that did where the customer service people that helped me over the phone. I am very upsets I am having massive anxiety attacks due to its I can't sleep at night and now I'm going to spend hundreds of dollars trying to fix the problem. I know for a fact this is the source because not only did the exterminator tell me so but I do not have company in my house and I am so busy that I don't go to anybody's house I just go to work go to school and come home. Im an extremely clean person and i honestly didnt think the matress was the sourse until they told me it was. Walmart you need to keep track of your packages better and make sure you are not giving away bug infested mattresses passing them off as new.

4595,46495,MelissaB,28/09/2019,Walmart,"I placed an order for a mattress on Sept 18 because it had ""2 Day delivery on the product page. After completing the order I received a confirmation that said delivery by 9/25! I was angry but too busy to start my search again. My son is sleeping on the floor while he waits for this. On 9/24 I received a notice that the box spring I'd ordered with it had been delivered early, then I received a separate email telling me the mattress itself was on backorder. I called to ask how long and was told indefinitely. I proceeded to shop on the site for another mattress and confirmed with customer service that it was in stock and the 2 day delivery was correct. This time I did receive a confirmation stating the mattress would arrive on 9/26 (2 days as described on the product page) so we were happy he'd only have two more nights on the floor. The next day I received a notification it had shipped but when I checked the tracking FedEx stated it had not been received by them yet. Fast forward and it's the 27th and they started a new order for me that now will not ship out until the 30th and may arrive 10/2....I'm so done with them I can't even. Now even going to some other site will not get mattress faster. NEVER AGAIN"

4598,44486,Arsel,28/09/2020,Walmart,"Union City, Ca Walmart No wonder why it has 2 stars, customer service sucks! The customer service managers this morning know nothing about good customer service. I was buying supplies and my husbands can of beers when the cashier finally ringing up the beer. She said oh it's not ringing up several times. Then she was looking around not calling anyone..My daughter and I were standing there in front of her without any other suggestions then I had to tell her can someone like manager check on the price and help. She didn't use a pager or anything but just looking around then finally she called a lady supervisor who was passing by who told me the same thing then I told her It's 24 something then she said to come with her to check the price which I did, bringing my daughter with me to the fridge again. The cashier told the CS manager to suspend the transaction so she can take customers then when we were at the fridge I told her I got it there where the 24 something price. She checked her phone captured the barcode and saw it's for the Budweiser and the beer cans I was buying was only 19.48 which we saw bunches of them on the next side. She took a picture of it and check the price/confirmed it but instead of her telling the cashier herself, she got a call from the radio, told me to go back and tell the price myself.... Of course that is not the end of the inconvenience, the cashier can't ring it up.. She needs the ""freaking"" barcode. I told her I don't know why she has to tell me to tell the cashier and yet she can't help me...Then they called another Indian/Fijian supervisor and instead of resolving the issue, she was lecturing me about their protocol that they cannot sell the cans of beer because it's not in their system but yet they had it on the floor for sale not just one but so many of them. What kind of store who will place the items and not check their products to make sure they are in their system for sale. The managers excuse she doesn't work there, she can have it remove from the fridge but not sell the products and they can get in trouble for selling and not in their system where in fact the other supervisor had the barcode and took a picture/confirmed the price but fail to tell her cashier, had to do it myself!!! Then that lady who took the barcode came back too late to show the other supervisor but still that supervisor doesn't want me to have it because I was already giving them attitude...WHO WOULDN'T COMING BACK AND FORTH AND STILL UNRESOLVED. I tried to leave the store but then again I want to complain about the quality of service how the issue was handled and still I was not able to get the cans of beer. They called another manager who didn't do anything instead of resolving my issue. She asked her manager instead of me? Don't you think she should talk to the customer instead of her co-employees??? This filipino manager didn't even ring up the item, not even resolved the issue as well.. Said the same thing even though they already have the barcode!!!I Didn't even try to resolve a customer's issue... It was a waste of time to call another superior because she was not helpful either. Honestly, I don't drink beer and I'm just getting this for my husband and since I need supplies for my older daughter that I had to get it at the same time thinking that I will be able to get these items without traveling from store to store due to Covid19. The motto ""live better Walmart"" yes because of the price is cheaper than others but the quality of service is poor...and being a long time customer at this store... I am very disappointed and will never ever go back....."

I want to say that this reminds me of Whole Foods with lots of healthy options to choose from. You can also find some convenient items like batteries, toothbrush, razors, etc.  For the whole ~10 minutes we were there (this duration will actually show on your receipt), we took and put some items back. The impressive part about it was that we received the receipt the next day and the charges were spot on.  The prices were decent here for the convenience you're receiving. Overall, I'd come back!"

Now you only see 1/3 if the screen for your cart & it's so complicated to just get free delivery that it took 3 phone calls from Walmart. One guy told me I couldn't order because I must use the latest version of Google Chrome & I use Microsoft Edge. Another said none of my 23 items must not be available for shipping. The 3rd rep said that wasn't true. It turned out that only 1 item was for store pick up only.. I had to go back from the check out page to delete the 1 item & then return to the check out page. Just press buttons until you figure it out. How ridiculous! I think this nightmare is being caused by their attempt in increasing the costly Walmart+ membership.

I went into the Walmart Neighborhood Grocery store in Escondido, CA once and it was as expected, gross and icky but they carried a particular lunch item that I canâ€™t find anywhere else. So I tried the DELIVERY, thinking this would save me the disgusting trip into the store. WORST ONLINE EXPERIENCE EVER!!! First of all they charge a delivery fee no matter how much your order is, totally ridiculous. Then they delivered me 4 expired food products, 2 of which were the lunch item I wanted. And I donâ€™t mean a week expired. They were over a month expired! Who even keeps month long expired products on the shelves???After a week of back and forth emails Iâ€™ve only received a partial credit and they keep insisting Iâ€™ve received a full credit, despite me showing them I havenâ€™t. Also, unlike target or sprouts delivery, Walmart charges you for each bag they use. I had a small order and 11 bags were used, many bags had 1 small item per bag (like a small box of granola bars) even the delivery girl commented saying she didnâ€™t know why they would do that. Gee let me guess, because the people putting my order together couldnâ€™t care less. They clearly have no clue and donâ€™t care and good luck if something goes wrong. I will never go to Walmart again, they just solidified their reputation as a low class store. There are so many options now you would think Walmart would at least try to act like they care or want to be competitive."

4623,44482,Marco K,29/09/2020,Walmart,"AWFUL SERVICE AND EXPERIENCE  I picked up a fridge purchased online at the Penguin Warehouse Pick-up location at 629 Eastern Avenue, Toronto, ON. When I brought it home in my SUV and opened the box, I was shocked to find it very badly damaged. Imagine my shock given this was the first time I had ever purchased anything online from Walmart. In addition to being damaged, the online delivery timer was consistently incorrect and gave extremely misleading information (as late as the afternoon after I picked it up, hours after I already had the item in hand, it was still shown to be in-processing at some warehouse and not yet even READY for pick-up).  A customer service representative from Walmart that I spoke to earlier that day informed me that the item was indeed NOT ready for pick-up, that they would be communicating with Penguin by email, and that the item would only be ready several days from then (while it was ALREADY sitting there waiting to be picked up). Sceptical, I called Penguin to verify and, lo and behold, they informed me that the item had been delivered DAYS prior and was waiting for me since the original delivery date of Saturday, August 1, in spite of what was posted online and told to me DIRECTLY by Walmart personnel.  Now, not only had I been repeatedly misled by the Walmart staff, website, and online tracking services, but I was stuck with an unacceptably damaged item. Walmart SAID they would be dispatching Canada Post to pick up the damaged item, and I was told to send them an email confirming my contact & address details.  FOR OVER A WEEK NOTHING HAPPENS - NO PICK-UP, NO CALLBACK, NOTHING!  I called four times on the the 1-800 number they provided (1-800-328-0402), and after being on hold for a very very long time each time, I finally got through to a clerk. By this time, I was understandably frustrated. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was informed the only ones available were monolingual Quebecois located in Quebec, and that I would be REQUIRED to speak French if I were to get through to them.  This is absolutely ludicrous, unacceptable, and borderline unconstitutional. Since when did Walmart become a french or anglo-exclusionary company? How is this at all legal? So far as I know, this it is not - you cannot force me to speak French to a supervisor when receiving service in Toronto (much the same that a Francophone cannot be denied service in French if requested, and be forced to speak English).  I was told to send the initial email and that Walmart would respond within a ""couple of days"". They did not. I emailed again (after over a week), still nothing.  After being told it would be picked up from my house, but never receiving a phone call or email or any kind of correspondence confirming or scheduling this, the damaged fridge was still sitting in my living room weeks after I was told it would be picked up. Doubting this would happen at all - I took matters into my own hands. Keep in mind, every correspondence of mine to Walmart was met with a boilerplate auto-response lie that they would respond ""within 3-4 business days"". Until THIS WEEK, they never responded back with either a phone-call or email.  After jumping through all that rigamarole and BS, I had to go, by myself, lifting this fridge, and bringing it directly to Canada Post so that they could pack it up and send it back.  To add insult to injury, Walmart not only ignored my communication with them, but despite acknowledging my claim and offering a refund, none was ever received. It took me contacting my credit card company to dispute the matter so that the charges associated with the fridge would be voided and a refund finally given to me. This was over TWO MONTHS after Walmart told me they would refund the charges, sending an email confirming this, but never doing so or communicating back at all. All this for a product that arrived in an unacceptably damaged condition.  The only correspondence I ever got back from Walmart after August 13th, despite repeated attempts at contacting them for either clarification on the pick-up or refund, was THIS PAST WEEK on September 24th, when they acknowledged the complaint from my CREDIT CARD COMPANY (acknowledging NONE of their failures in communication or customer service as outlined above)  Needless to say, I will not be shopping with Walmart, either in person or online, ever again. Buyers beware!"

Amazing experience there, though if you're getting in there for a quick pick up for lunch, get ready to fight the crowds of tourists. Food is overpriced for what you're getting, to be honest. There's a lot of great cafes nearby that have better food quality at the prices you're paying (full service)"

4631,42272,German Irizarry,29/09/2021,Walmart,Will never shop there again. There is a reason they sell cheap items. Don't waste your time shopping there and go to a normal place. The customer service line is a joke as well. Probably hire unemployed rednecks to man their lines. Go to Target or Costco instead. Cancelling my Samsclub membership as well.
4632,42273,NBild,29/09/2021,Walmart,"If you find you are buying from the Walmart Market Place DO NOT do it. I bought from iSave via Walmart. I received a faulty product but by the time I got everything in order and contacted iSave (I had first contacted Walmart which took time) the 30 days - from the date of order - not the date of receiving!!! - had passed. They said, ""TOUGH!"" Could they be in the business of moving on faulty goods??? Read a few iSave reviews where 99% gave 1 star ... and only because you cannot write a review without giving a star. Walmart needs to distance itself from iSave. Use this company at your own peril."
4633,42274,Robert Davis,29/09/2021,Walmart,I ordered one item (electric scooter of a specific color). The item is expensive but Walmart arbitrarily substituted the wrong item. So after shipping the incorrect item Walmart makes me have to drive to store to return the item and then doesn't refund the shipping price and tip left for the driver. Walmart's mistake - Amazon is so much superior.
4634,42275,Diane McGee,29/09/2021,Walmart,New app is awful! They need to fire their app developers. Iâ€™ve never seen a more complicated and useless app! It was fine so Iâ€™m not sure why they changed it
4635,42276,Barbara Stevens,29/09/2021,Walmart,New app is HORRIBLE. Why did you have to change it? It's impossible to navigate. WHY WHY WHY!!!
4636,42277,Kathryn Bates,29/09/2021,Walmart,"The new website is TERRIBLE! Why would they change it, it was awesome before. Nothing works like it should now, I can't find anything I'm searching for. Absolutely awful."
4637,42287,Kathryn Bates,29/09/2021,Walmart,"The new website is TERRIBLE! Why would they change it, it was awesome before. Nothing works like it should now, I can't find anything I'm searching for. Absolutely awful."
4638,44476,Tony Smith,30/09/2020,Walmart,"I purchased a battery for my 4 wheeler when I got ready to install it I found that it was too small. There website said that it would fit of course you can't get any help because of covid automotive was closed, so when I returned it to the store my receipt had gotten wet and faded so they said because it was over $40.00 they could not refund it nor me credit unless the receipt. Please don't buy things like this from Wal-Mart bad business it had never been open."
4639,44477,Ann Hiebler,30/09/2020,Walmart,At the store on 192 In Vancouver WA is allowing customers not to wear masks. I was in line to check out and nicely asked two woman to put their masks on. One woman started flipping me off and the other started to verbally attack me. I am a senior and if I get covid I will most likely need to be intubated.  The cashier said absolutely nothing. Even when the woman got very close and breath heavilly in my direction. I found out when I spoke to another employee that they can not ask a person to wear a mask except when they are entering the store. I did not know that the state allowed that.  Needless to say I will not be shopping at this store or any other walmart.  You can let walmart know but it wont make a difference.
4640,44478,Yara Sae,30/09/2020,Walmart,"If you have Anthem's Healthy Benefits Plus do not use it at any Walmart stores because if you do Walmart will accuse you of being a thief, committing fraud and running a scam on Walmart among other things. Every time I use Anthem's Healthy Benefits Plus there is always some kind of system error at check out, and then the cashiers get rude, give attitude, become belligerent, and insinuate and accuse me of committing fraud and running a scam on Walmart, which I'm not. The problem is that the Walmart cashiers don't know what they're doing as they don't know how to check out an Anthem customer with a Healthy Benefits Plus card. It's embarrassing, humiliating, demeaning, degrading and debasing every time a manager comes over and when they get security involved. Anthem needs to cut all ties with Walmart and kick Walmart to the curb! I am done with Anthem and Walmart!"
4641,44479,Louis Cambridge,30/09/2020,Walmart,The most disorganized store and dirty. Have no desire to shop there anymore
4642,44480,Rebecca Oberman,30/09/2020,Walmart,I ordered delivery for between 5-6pm and it is now 7:51pm. Never again. Probably won't even get it.
4643,44481,Ngan T,30/09/2020,Walmart,"I bought a bike in Walmart in Tempe, AZ (800 E Southern Ave, Tempe, AZ 85282). After 40 days, I wanted to return to get a bigger bike. Per Walmart Bike Return Policy, the bike can be returned in 90 days. However, the store (Store # 5768), the manager's name Tamera (she did not want to tell her last name) did not let me to return it. She said that that specific store had the policy that only allowed customers to return bikes before 30 days. I asked her to show me the policy, she could not but did not want to honor the company's policy. I even took the print out of the policy with me but she did not care. The whole customer service group let me stand there for more than 30 minutes and did not want to take care of my request. After that, I went to a different Walmart (1380 W Elliot Rd, Tempe, AZ 85284) then they took care of my request. So why don't employees of Walmart respect the company's policy? It is a bad sign for a company's management. Please take a look at your employees and make sure that your employees understand and comply the policies. If not, why do you have policies for?"
4644,36226,Boon C.,30/09/2018,Amazon Go,"Amazon Go is basically a tourist attraction now near Amazon Headquarter. It first virtual shopping. You can download the Amazon Go App before you walk in. Then they track your movements around the store. You can pick up the items and return the item to same place.  One important thing is not pick up the item and pass to next person and return to the place. This will count against you as a buy. You can find the chef or work cutting and assemble the fresh food on the window. They have full components kitchen to bake, cook, or made the fresh food of the day.  If you have go app, you walk in and get the Amazon go bag free without buying anything. Basically it is a good promotion for many who carry Amazon logo. The store has very limited selection brand. But it does carry enough items to convenient supply your need."
4645,36403,Leina K.,30/09/2018,Amazon Go,Such a weird experience to feel like you're shoplifting and just walk out of the store. I've been a couple of times and like that they have so many options. They've also started stocking meal prep kits like blue apron and hello fresh. Typically they have 4 meals available for 2 people. It'll be interesting to watch more stores open and see if this can become a regular thing vs a tourist destination.
4646,42258,Driekiaus Dickens,30/09/2021,Walmart,An app that was working very well now an app that is complex and useless
4647,42259,Glenna Maddux,30/09/2021,Walmart,"I have always there is nothing Walmart could do that would make me mad after they started the pickup and delivery service. However, the website is a disaster. Have no idea how to read the charges on my credit card. Not mad enough to quit them."
4648,42260,Carly,30/09/2021,Walmart,"The new app for ordering online is terrible. I placed an order for $134, then a couple hours later tried to add 4 more items, but the site said my credit card had been removed. I spent over an hour updating my account, credit card number, etc. and NOTHING worked. I called Walmart. They told me to call Door Dash. Door Dash couldn't find my account. Also the new app doesn't send emails that the order has been received, items replaced, etc. UNSATISFACTORY web site."
4649,42261,Catherine Schmitt,30/09/2021,Walmart,"What a MESS This new app has caused. I cancelled my delivery service as when ordering groceries some items are mailed in a few days. Who thinks delivery of Potato Chips is ok. Then some items are placed in your cart, some items for delivery. WHY and then if you can't find their brand for double the cost you can put a brand name in your cart. And the Prices???? on so many items. What in the name is going on. So GLAD other food chains in this area have delivery..So long Wal-Mart"
4650,42262,Roberta Sowells,30/09/2021,Walmart,"This new app is the worst, takes forever, says item not available when you looking at it. At this point unless they do something about the app, I will find a new store to shop, I say we boycott until they change the app, because whoever came up with that should be fired. Apps are suppose to get better not worst"
4651,42263,Randy Levings,30/09/2021,Walmart,"I will never go to walmart again. They treat you like you are a thief and if you want to ever buy anything in the locked glass counters they make you go through the longest checkout line there. Spent almost an hour finding someone with keys and waiting in that long line with 12 customers ahead of me. All this for some stupid underwear, not Diamonds or jewelry, UNDERWEAR. I even found it cheaper on amazon where i will shop from now on or Target. Walmart is a failing company for a good reason."
4652,42264,Nicole Gee,30/09/2021,Walmart,The new app is awful!!! Being back the old app!
4653,42265,Elaine kelly,30/09/2021,Walmart,I tried the unlimited delivery for 12.99 and they will bill you for stuff and you don't receive I hate they serve I'm stop in my membership it's a rip off and they upcharged the prices on the food. I put in for a refund never received it. 3 times I put the refund in and I never got it. It was for items that wasn't in stock and they never gave me my money back
4654,42266,Bryce Koontz,30/09/2021,Walmart,"My shipment has been promised to arrive the last 4 days and it still hasnâ€™t Iâ€™ve texted their agents, called and reached out many times. They keep promising itâ€™ll show up tonight as days and days go by. Iâ€™ll never shop here again. Horrible experience"
4655,42267,CDurham,30/09/2021,Walmart,For the past couple of weeks since they changed Walmart.com I can't see images of the products. It's impossible to shop if I can't see the image before deciding to click on it for more information or to order! Has anyone else experienced no product images on Walmart.com???
4656,42268,John John,30/09/2021,Walmart,All customers need to be carefully at the prices. The price it difference when you check out. When i call the peoples work at Walmart to talk about it. They says if i not happy then dont buy it
